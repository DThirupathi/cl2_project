Pre-processing:
1. Extracting the user information along with their status messages and storing
   them in separate files labeled by user-id.txt:
	- execute main() method in ProcessData.java
	- for labeled data: readStatusFile()
	- for unlabeled data: readUnlabStatusFile()

2. Emoticon processing:
	- execute main() method in ProcessEmoticon.java

3. Removing . and / for enhancing the tokenizing process
	- deletechar.sh

3. Processing

	- python preprocessing.py --help


Word2vec (using gensim):

python using_gensim.py 


Feature selection:
1. Generate the QA vectors:
	- invoke SortList() in ProcessData.java

2. Get the features with their respective Pearson correlation coefficients:
	- python findCorr.py > pccmat.features

3. Sort the features in descending order:
	- sort -t $',' -k2,2rn pccmat.features > sorted.pccmat.features
