"i am fully aware that when a person is wanting to adopt a new dog that they have the right to be a little particular in what they want   they are choosing a member of their family that they will live with for years to come; however, i cannot understand what the difference is between a 7 lb poodle and a 9-10 lb poodle   can someone please enlighten me???"

"so many people ask us \where do you find the pets you rescue?\"" well", my \3bdf74392995f26dd4ba4468a892f520,"please put this on your status if you know or \are related to someone who suffers from stupidity  people need to \understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously  you \could be sitting next to a sufferer right now  there is still no known \cure for stupidity and sympathy does not help  but we can raise \awareness  \93% won't copy and paste this because they don't know how to \copy and paste   "
"â€œfor\ perhaps, if the truth were known, we are all a little blind, a little \deaf, a little handicapped, a little lonely, a little less than perfect \ and if we can learn to appreciate and utilize the dogâ€™s full potential,\ we will, together, make it in this life on earth â€� -author unknown"
"thurs, <propmale> (a 5 yr mini poodle x) was surgically relieved of an inability to urinate by a procedure known as a pu  we had him flown in from ct on wed bc his situation was too critical for ground transport  unfortunately, we had to move so quickly to get <propmale> here and evaluated, we had no time to work on fund-raising for his care  if you are able to spare even $1, no donation is too small!"
"<propmale> is one week into his recovery from his pu surgery and is already peeing like he was born to squat!  go, <propmale>, go  wink   we are still needing donations to help with his medical e playful enses as we have only had one donation made thus far  sad "
"so the final count on the pups is 11!!! andi (momma) has definitely bitten off more than she can chew for a first litter   that's right, this girl is most certainly less than a year old! she is a 35-ish lb mix and looks like a miniature <propfemale> retriever "
"setting up andi and crew's new crate with much more room for growing puppy butts  smile \thank you to <propfemale> horvitz garlington and <propfemale> hebert allday for making the bigger kennel possible!!!"
"public opinion poll::: i would like your opinion on the following situation   \a \rescue organization\"" takes in a dog with a broken jaw and gets no medical care for her stating that she is pregnant and there is nothing that can be done due to her reproductive status  they force her to raise her litter while in unquestionable pain  is this a case of neglect? are they justified in refusing care because she is pregnant?"""
"ok, fb friends  we have two new dogs that need our help  no name is a 45-ish lb mix that was hit by a car and needs a <propmale> home  his medical has been generously donated by the samaritan who witnessed his accident and rushed him to the animal er  no name needs a <propmale> for 6-8 wks while he recuperates from his injuries  and <propmale> needs financial support  check out his album - pitiful "
"<propmale> update: we have our fourth meal down and have finally started to pee w the fluids (i was beginning to get a bit worried)  he seems to be perkier than 16 hrs ago, but it is all relative and i'm looking for improvement so    he is vocal now so i guess that means that there is some energy other than what is needed to live, metabolically speaking  i hate to make predictions and jinx the whole endeavor, so i won't "
"the first 24 hrs of <propmale>'s new life have been very productive  i just took him outside for the second time to meet auntie <propfemale> and the chicken delivery  he is now standing, albeit wobbly and very awkwardly, and he was even adamantly sniffing a bush! i have faith that <propmale> is definitely going to make it! howlelujah!!!"
"day 3 for nick: yes, we did bloodwork today and everything looked good but his bun (renal) was slightly off  this could be due to his overall poor hydration status  he has been eating very well on his own but seems uninterested in drinking water  we are going to monitor for now  overall, he is doing awesome!!! standing on his own more and seems to just be in better spirits all around "
"we are almost a week into <propmale>'s recovery and he is doing great! he now has an uri, most likely picked it up at the shelter, but we have antibiotics so no biggie on that front  he is still eating every 4-5 hrs  we are trying to start spacing meals out a little more to get him on a more normal schedule  he already looks sooo much better and will have a new video posted today to show off his progress  smile "
"andi & crew update: the last nine weeks have been a whirl-wind of puppy butts and drama, but we have survived our ordeal  smile  the great exodus is upon us and the puppies are leaving one by one over the next week to their new families  andi has also been adopted and will be heading with her new dad to tx the first weekend in march  howlelujah!!!"
anyone know anything about blue-fronted amazon parrots?
"<propmale>: day 8 - <propmale> is still making it, but even with starting him on antibiotics after the first sniffle, his uri is still getting worse  and with kennel cough, they always get sooo much worse before starting to get better that i am beginning to get nervous about the next few days  he has already started to eat less per feeding so we are going to keep him at smaller meals every 4 hrs  i just feel terrible for him  sad "
"i need some advice! my htc touchpro2 finally died on sat and i need help deciding on a new smartphone  the tp2 had all the features i wanted (slide-out qwerty, full large touch screen, gps, great reception, etc) but was a nightmare pretty much from the day i got it over a year ago  one mechanical issue after another  i am very rough w my cell so an iphone is not an option   "
<propmale> update - day 15: <propmale> is doing well thanks to his auntie <propfemale> hebert allday for bringing him his chicken and herbal meds for his congestion  <propmale> also wants to shout out to his auntie <propfirst> <propfirst> hinsman at destination dog for all of the nutritional advise that has keep his little body kicking and progressing  (cont'd in comments)

"i  love  the internet  without it i would not have the bestest friends that i have never met in person, the most awesome adopters that have gone above and beyond for the critters whose lives i salvaged but that are really living bc someone other than me could see the value in their souls, be bankrupt (financially & emotionally) and unable to continue the rescue work that drives me every day, i could go on but   "
