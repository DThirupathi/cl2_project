r i p  <propmale> <propfirst>
fuckin hoola-hoop girl
fucken bored
"i smoke a fat pound of grass \and fall on my ass faster than the fat bitch who sat down too fast \c'mere slut, i don't give a fuck god sent me to piss the world off \my english teacher wanted to have sex in <propmale> high,\the only problem was my english teacher was a guy \i smacked him in the face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler,\stapled his nuts to a stack of papers \walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up \flashed the bartender, then stuck my <propmale> in the tip cup \extraterrestrial, killin pedestrians \raping lesbians while they screaming annoyed lets just be friends!!\am i comin' or goin?\i can barely decide \i ain't had a woman in years,\my palms are too hairy to hide!"
"straight from the hip, cut to the chase \i'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face \play no games, say no names\i'm a different man, kiss my ass \kiss my lips, bitch why ask?\kiss my <propmale>, hit my cash \i'd rather have you whip my ass \don't put out? i'll put you out \won't get out? i'll push you out \puss blew out, poppin' shit \wouldn't piss on fire to put you out \am i too nice? buy you ice\bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life "
who the fuck farted on my pillow?
"come gather 'round people\wherever you roam\and admit that the waters\around you have grown\and accept it that soon\you'll be drenched to the bone \if your time to you\is worth savin'\then you better start swimmin'\or you'll sink like a stone\for the times they are a changin' "
"all i know is pain\all i feel is rain\how can i maintain\with that shit on my brain?"
"finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind\people think i'm insane because i am frowning all the time\all day long i think of things but nothing seems to satisfy\think i'll lose my mind if i don't find something to pacify\can you help me occupy my brain?\i need someone to show me the things in life that i can't find\i can't see the things that make true happiness, i must be blind\make a joke and i will sigh and you will laugh and i will cry\happiness i cannot feel and love to me is so unreal\and so as you hear these words telling you now of my state\i tell you to enjoy life i wish i could but it's too late"
"i never showed what was inside \you would have cursed and cried,\if i ended myself by suicide \forced myself to wear a smile,\spread jolly good joy for awhile \then my body gave out\and death soon came \you think living is lame?\i'm spending an eternity in flame\and i'm the only one to blame \then the worst caught up with the bad,\i lost two people i thought i'd always have \a drunk driver missed the brake and hit the gas,\now i'm kicking myself in the ass \i collapse and bury my head,\as demons hiss \your parents are dead!\""\",b4b038e5fd4b6ae4f3cd0140f934b879,"the hopeful side of me waits for your text \but the side of me that knows better,\is glad when no text comes \then the side of me that never learns makes a move "
"all is well,\but i still weep inside \made a move\and got denied!!\lol"
"god <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change;\courage to change the things i can;\and wisdom to know the difference \living one day at a time;\enjoying one moment at a time;\accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;\taking, as he did, this sinful world\as it is, not as i would have it;\trusting that he will make all things right\if i surrender to his will;\that i may be reasonably happy in this life\and supremely happy with him\forever in the next \amen\\good night, shitheads "
yay insomnia
"i offered a helping hand,\she gave me the cold shoulder \i gave her the tingle,\she played me like sorry \the world is in flame,\she's still on my brain \i can't shake this off,\she's here to stay \to suffer no more,\i pray "
"i'm not playing your game it's no fun\this is me throwing in my towel, hun \if you still don't get it try this one,\leave me alone, i'm done "
"is that grape soda? \wtf yo"
"repetition, repetition, repe-tit-ion"
zero motivation today
"yeah, just to be happy for once\i sacrificed things that never should be \thinking itâ€™ll be worth it in the end\but when itâ€™s in sight the world does a 180 on me \now iâ€™m stuck in limbo between who i used to be\and the mislead youth that you now see \trying to stay sane and keep my head straight\but my inner voice is telling me it's too late \no joy, no love, no hope\iâ€™m running uphill in this life long race\just to make it one behind last place "
