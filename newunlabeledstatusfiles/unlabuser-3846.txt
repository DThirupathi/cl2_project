"so, today nature really wanted to make itlself known   just a strange day that started w  hearing deer calls from all sides of the woods around me during my 5 smile 0am run, my dog throwing up, a turtle crossing the parking lot on campus holding up traffic, then a family of geese crossing a main highway holding up traffic, and finally two giant dragon flies connected at the hip sitting on my windshield for 5 or 6 blocks "
"a run at 9 smile 0am is very different than a run at 5 smile 0am!! i thinking i nearly killed my dog and myself   oh, and then locked myself out of the house  there's a wasted hour of my life i'll never get back   smile  lol"

so i think i've found that my limit for sitting in the library doing math is right around 8 hours solid   especially since i ran out of snacks like 6 hours ago  i'm so glad that the math service (and online textbook) i purchased to use for all of 5 weeks has been down the past 2 days & will be down the rest of the weekend   so here i sit   
so today i happened to look out my back window just in time to see a 3 foot black snake very rapidly slithering from one end of my yard to the other while being chased & pecked by two birds!!! i don't think i could have run as fast as he moved!!
i think i'm the only 269 spouse that didn't leave town while the guys are away this month 
$h!+  my engine light came on!! that is literally the last thing i need right now 
"that's some bad hat, <propmale> "
i think i'll mix it up for dinner tonight and have grape nuts instead of shredded wheat 
i've discovered that having your own inside joke with yourself is quite cathartic 
"â€œwe the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful  we have done so much, with so little, for so long, we are now qualified to do anything, with nothing â€�   but wait, now we need to do more   with even less  somewhere along the way, the math doesn't compute "

"why do we consider the weather boring to talk about? it changes everything, whether its a <propfemale> day, blizzard or hurricane, it evokes sentimental feelings, and dictates what holiday we're looking forward to  how can that be boring?"
uh-oh   i hope this isn't a migraine brewing   
"ahhh, a beautiful start to a fresh new day   freshly ground coffee, shredded wheat, & toast topped with avocado slices dashed with coarse kosher salt   and a very heavy dog head resting in my lap  up next, a morning jog, and then back to the books  and so grateful the migraine is gone "
