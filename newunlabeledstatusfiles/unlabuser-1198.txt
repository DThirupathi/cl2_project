is planning to have fun this weekend   <>
did have fun this weekend!!!!
is riding the emotional roller coaster called life    wheee!
"to look at him every night\her soul her instincts spur;\and as he looks at her for weeks\he falls in love with her \\and as on her elbows she leans\her <propfemale> and her whim\she feels in her heart and soul that\she falls in love with him "
"a wild path through the woods\walking along waterfalls\pacing high and low\a hand stretch, a touch\the breadth of your arms\holding me close to your heart\the depth of your palm\a perfect place for my face to rest\your soft shoulder where\i breathe and rest on happiness"
leadership development can be fun (if pliny the elder is invited)   
"whether you think you can or you can't, you're right   "
"is looking forward to dinner and drinks at \casa de slimko\"""""
"if you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you call and what would you say?  and why are you waiting?  ~stephen levine"
"is feeling refreshed and relaxed, with a little smile on his face   "
"it is only with one's heart that one can see clearly \what is essential is invisible to the eye "
"may this christmas season\fill your home with joy\your heart with love\and your life with laughter "
"we are not here to fit in, be well balanced, or provide exempla for others  we are here to be eccentric, different, perhaps strange, perhaps merely to add our small piece, our little clunky, chunky selves, to the great mosaic of being  as the gods intended, we are here to become more and more ourselves -- <propfirst> <propfirst>"
today is the first day of the rest of your life
a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty  - <propmale> churchill
the walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keep out the joy   ~jim rohn
the word 'happiness' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness  ~carl <propfemale>
looking forward to time spent in death valley
