"i want to, i want to be someone else or i'll e playful lode floating upon the surface for the birds, the birds, the birds"
in a little while  i'll be gone  the moment's already passed  yeah it's gone  and i'm not here  this isn't happening  i'm not here  i'm not here

i can't tell you what you want to hear i can't give you what you need to heal i can't touch you what you need to feel
see what can happen when the <propmale>'s bullpen doesnt blow up
is listening to some sigur ros great band
everyone everyone around here everyone is so near it's holding on it's holding on
give me an answer give me a sign i've been climbing up this ladder i've been wasting my time
how come i end up where i started? how come i end up where i went wrong? won't take my eyes off the ball again you reel me out then you cut the string
i feel my time is slipping away every minute gone by seems like a day iâ€™ll never get back the things i lost along the way what the hell is wrong with me? this isnâ€™t who iâ€™m supposed to be i feel more alone every day and just so far away i know somethingâ€™s got to change inside of me
"i do not understand what it is i've done wrong\full of holes check for pulse blink your eyes one for yes two for no\i have no idea what i am talking about i am trapped in this body and can't get out"
"faith, you're driving me away you do it everyday you don't mean it but it hurts like hell\my brain says i'm receiving pain a lack of oxygen from my life support my iron lung"
take me to that summer past and tell me is it really worth remembering? i realize that music then was really just a song in my head and though the fun has past those mythic dreams would never last
it's the devil's way now there is no way out you can scream and you can shout it is too late now because you're not there
"tell me would you kill to save a life? tell me would you kill to prove you're right? crash, crash, burn, let it all burn this hurricane's chasing us all underground"
"pray to your god, open your heart whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark cover your eyes, the devil inside\one night of the <propmale> one day i will get revenge one night to remember one day it'll all just end"
"bummed out again by your only business friend the smell of fear is thicker than you think don't do it don't jump\changed shape to fit in the end you just feel sick a million love songs under anaesthetic hey don't do it don't jump"
"i walked the line, the line i choose i see the people in front of me i climbed the wall, the wall of news i watched them show the tragedy"
"and it rained all night and then all day the drops were the size of your hands and face the worms come out to see what's up we pull the cars up from the river\it's relentless invisible indefatigable indisputable undeniable"
"we don't want to believe that the world can still move on we don't want to believe that the sun can still shine on\if we're gonna kill each other how we gonna live forever if we're gonna live forever how we gonna kill each other"
"certain death haven't had the heart to yet maybe by the time we meet you can recognize a change in me baby, certain death haven't had the <propmale> to yet maybe by the time we meet you can recognize a change in me"
"a line is drawn up in the sand is this the way to no where land you've never seen the sky like this you never want die like this\comets falling for the earth is this the end or a rebirth you never seen the sky like this you never want die like this"
i know it's really hard to see that we are the enemyi know it's really hard to see that we are the enemy of the earth
"blackbird singing in the dead of night take these broken wings and learn to fly all your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise\black bird singing in the dead of night take these sunken eyes and learn to see all your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free"
"the normal make a living, the deranged make history"
"according to the los <propfemale> times, 63% of families in <propfemale> are now considered dysfunctional  that means that we are the majority  it's the people with the mom, dad, brother, sister, white picket fence, those people are the *freaks*!"
"people can no longer cover their eyes, if this disturbs you then walk away! you will remember the night you were struck by the sight of, ten thousand fists in the air!"
"i don't care if it hurts i want to have control i want a perfect body i want a perfect soul i want you to notice when i'm not around you're so fucking special i wish i was special\but i'm a creep i'm a weirdo"
"when i try to open up to you i get completely lost houses swallowed by the earth, windows thick with frost and i reach deep down within, but the pathways twist and turnand thereâ€™s no light anywhere, and nothing left to burn\and i am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam and no emotion thatâ€™s worth having could call my heart its home my heartâ€™s an autoclave my heartâ€™s an autoclave"
congrats to the 2010 graduating class
"you're so pretty, i could burst and i wonder, who's gonna talk first my muscles all shaking, and blood's turned to foam it's tuesday, and you're going home "
"woke up afraid of my own shadow like, genuinely afraid headed for the pawnshop to buy myself a switchblade someday somethings coming from way out beyond the stars to kill us while we stand here it will store our brains in <propmale> jars and then the girl behind the counter asks \how do you feel today?\"" and i say \""i feel like lovecraft in brooklyn!\"""""
finally beat <propfirst> at basketball
"new slang when you notice the stripes, the dirt in your fries \hope it's right when you die, old and bony \<propfemale> breaks like a bull through the hall,\never should have called\but my head's to the wall and i'm lonely "
map-quest directions should start at #5   i think i can get out my neighborhood on my own 
"have you ever thought that perhaps <propfemale>'s map is trying to kill her? i mean really, look at all the danger he puts her in"
"a good friend will bail you out of jail, but a best friend will bail you out and say \haha i told you i could run faster!\"""""
"after reading about 100 things to do before you die, i couldn't help wondering why \yell for help\"" wasn't on the list?"""
"if green means go and red means stop! what does yellow mean? speed the hell up, its almost red "
"there are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface"
human bonds always lead to messy complications  commitment  sharing  driving people to the airport 
we create our own <propfemale> every day we live
r i p big 12
on another day c'mon c'mon with these ropes i tied can we do no wrong now we grieve cause now is gone things were good when we were young with my teeth locked down i can see the blood of a thousand men who have come and gone now we grieve cause now is gone things were good when we were young
"it's said that everything is connected to everything  the butterfly effect  you drop a pebble into a pond and the ripples radiate outward, affecting everything  until finally a fish grows arms and legs and crawls out of the water, and picks up a rock and smashes the next two fish over the head, and we have the first serial killer "
"i ain't happy  i'm feeling glad  i got sunshine in a bag  i'm useless, but not for long  the future is coming on "
never let the facts get in the way of the truth
"i believe in nothing\one-hundred suns 'til we part\i believe in nothing\not in satan and not in god\i believe in nothing\not in peace and not in war\i believe in nothing\but the truth in who we are\i believe in nothing"
home movies is such an awkward show
"sometimes i don't know why we'd rather live than die, we look up towards the sky for answers to our lives  we may get some solutions but most just pass us by"
"the truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say? so why tell it? if ignorance is bliss, then i'm in heaven now "
limb by limb and tooth by tooth tearing up inside of me every day every hour i wish that i was bullet proof
some days it seems it's not worth it the fight in me is all gone and i'm not trying to be perfect but just get one damn thing done before i lose control i pick myself from the floor
although the summer's past those mythic dreams would never last do i care anymore and if it makes you sad remember all the things you have that can't be bought
"i want something good to die for to make it beautiful to live  i want a new mistake, loses more than hesitates  do you believe it in your head?"
"iâ€™m running aimless just to try to and find a place to belong i try e playful laining, but the words are always coming out wrong thereâ€™s so much more to myself than this"
ainâ€™t nobody around iâ€™m just sitting here by myself with next to nothing on my mind ainâ€™t nobody around iâ€™m just sitting here by myself relaxing on the borderline
"i hope i become a ghost  i hope i can see the end of time  i hope i become a ghost  and make sure the future turns out fine i hope i become a ghost  oh, when the world is said and done the stars will become so close and there will be nowhere that i can't run"
distracted by irrelevance the stress and the tension crawling through the keyhole i'm in a lull
keep it to yourself make your life a living hell die a little every day most people die that way
"fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen pour myself a cup of ambition and yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and if i never make it home today, god bless "

life is but a memory happened long ago  theatre full of sadness for a long forgotten show  seems so easy just to let it go on by till you stop and wonder why you never wondered why 
just learned that an hour an a half can really fly by quick
"common fears start to multiply  we realize we're paralyzed  where'd it go, all that precious time?  did we even try to stem the tide?"
it's not too late to feel a little more alive make an escape before we start to vaporize
remember what they say  there's no shortcut to a dream  it's all blood and sweat  and life is what you manage in between

it only takes one tree to make a thousand matches  it only takes one match to burn a thousand trees 
it sounds like a whisper it seems like a dream it breaks and it falls it tears at the seam suppose that it happens suppose that it's real supposing you're right suppose it won't heal forever
