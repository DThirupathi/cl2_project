just positive manifestation   everything will be alright 
"i've had quite a peaceful <propfirst>'s this year  sippin' on some coffee while <propfirst> <propmale> sings to me   smokin' all on my lonesome, and i'm glad i can actually say i'm enjoying myself  hope you had a good one too   "
it's one thing to underestimate someone and look like a fool  it's a whole other hell to overestimate someone and leave yourself disappointed   
"flaw of humanity: we always want what we can't have    and when we get it, we don't want it anymore  so   what and who will you hold onto, when there's nothing left?"
 smile  feeling very relieved right now   my mom made it through her heart surgery  they're talking about removing her ventilator tonight or tomorrow  hopefully she'll be able to wake up soon

"you can't always get what you want    but if you try sometime, you just might find    you get what you need "
its a bumpy road    but it sure is more fun that way 
"rest in peace grandma <propfemale>  i'll <propfemale> my memories of you, always "
"i promise i won't ask about you, or wonder where you are  everything is always changing, but i'm alright so far   if we're ever face to face, and where we want to be  promise me that things have changed, and all you want is me "
"to be rid of such a vexation to my spirit!! the relief! i am a woman  i am strong  i am not perfect, and neither are you  what defines a person, is how we face our flaws and our fears   "
i deserve it 
"i've been thoughtless, irrational, immature, and i'll never have those choices back   though i will not be forgiven or forgetful of this pain   i have my will to change, and with that, i shall "
i'm feeling rather accomplished  i cleaned this whole place  smile  now i can relax 
  these are the eyes of disarray   
"throw me away like the garbage i am, but remember    one man's trash is another man's treasure "
"it sucks when you feel it in your gut, that something isn't right   so you ignore it, or at least you try   and they come back to bite you while lookin' in your eyes  no words, just songs and a wave goodbye   "

wow   i don't know how to feel about the fact that i had no idea super 8 is a movie  i was starting to get worried about the sudden popularity of a motel 
well that was fun  smile  although fish slime doesn't smell too great   
just got back from halibut fishing with <propfemale> hermanns and <propfirst> cissell   'twas a ton o' fun  smile  i caught two puny fish 
"it's kind of weird when you're going through a rough time, and you suddenly realize that you're just fine  "
