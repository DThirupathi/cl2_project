"is haha good times, so tired from work though   "
early night cause i most definately need it   
is glad i moved my car while it was only in eight inches deep of water on the street since it is still pouring outside   
like a comet blazing 'cross the evening sky  gone too soon like a rainbow fading in the twinkling of an eye gone too soon shiny and sparkly and splendidly bright here one day gone one night like the loss of sunlight on a cloudy afternoon gone too soon lik
"i think these nicotine patches are making me bruise, cause i'm counting like 20 bruises right now and i hardly ever bruise   oh well"
was going to go to summerfest   but summerfest has already made me poor and i do not feel it would be wise to spend the last $20 in my pocket on a ticket and one beer   damn it all   
"taking it easy till the weekend, cause i'm sick of waking up every morning feeling like crap   "
finally got internet at my house! hooray!
so much for good intentions   
"bumming on the beach, doesn't get much better than this   "
"is fighting a battle i will eventually lose, the question is whether to continue fighting when the outcome is inevitable   "

"going up north for the state water ski show this weekend, should be fun!"
is abusing my body like i'm 18 again and my body is getting pissed   
"party at buckheads tomorrow (friday 7 24 09)! 7-9 $1 drinks 9-10 $2 drinks and 7-10 free entry as long as you use my name when you get there, cause i won a free party! hope to see you there!"
spending the day at <propmale> street festival since it is right by my house!
"trying to make my way to the beach looks like i might be flying solo, but its a nice day so i am probably going anyway   "
who the hell would order a taro smoothie? i mean are they for real?

ugh   
another birthday party soooo i am going to sleep all day tomorrow to recooperate from everything!
"wondering what to do with my day   the options are limitless, but a run followed by the beach sounds pretty good right now"
"i went for a run and sweat was stinging my eyes most of the run  after the run i threw up  but, i am trying to be more optimistic and i came to four conclusions  (one) i need to invest in a sweatband, (two) my nerves in my eyes still work, (three) i pushed myself to the best of my ability, and (four) i got a good ab workout from the retching  see there is always a silver lining!"
"just finished cleaning my room, it's so clean i hardly even recognize it!"
guess i had to go back to work eventually   
who in their right mind goes skinny dipping by themselves? oh that's right me apparently    
brewers game!
state fair on thursday for the first time in 8 years   kind of excited   
"if you wander enough you will find your car maybe and maybe figure a way to get home when you find it if you are lucky, guess i was lucky, but that doesn't mean i am not pissed cause believe me i am   "
after work i have decided to sleep until i must get up saturday morning cause i am running on fumes

one more day of work before a long weekend of fun!!!
and the fun begins!
going to bed early so not tempted to eat the food i don't have   
just pondering what to do with my life   
probably going out against my better judgement   
"watching the season finale of the first season of jericho, then hanging out with a long lost friend before a wedding reception"
needs to start prioritizing better
"going up north for the weekend, can't wait!"
i thought i smelled garlic   
"work all day, work all night, shitty   "
starting a long stretch of work   hip hip hooray   
"work early this morning, a nap just sounds perfect for after work"
"got bit, got scratched, got rug burn, got hit in the eye with a rock, all in a days work, yes indeed   "

sigh   first day in about a month with nothing planned and i don't feel like doing anything   
"beginning to think i have insomnia or something cause haven't been able to sleep much for a while now and when i have slept i kept waking up throughout the night, looks like i'm going to have to invest in some nyquil or something"
"<propfemale> kicked my ass, yet back i go on thursday     smile "

twiddling my thumbs   
lati fuckin da   
and that's just not the way it is   as much as i would like it to be   
"fuck that u don't want me to say shit then tell me, but i won't not say anything you tell me cause as a friend u should realize that that  is bullshit"
