"my horse was wild today   i think he was trying to imitate a bouncy ball   the weird thing is when he's wild he's also sidedead   oh well, having a normal horse is overrated lol   if you knew him you'd understand   he may not be the smartest but he's almost always happyand has the funniest personality"
"ahhhhh!!!!!!!  i've been having horse-withdrawl syptoms school is majorly cutting into my horse time(not that i actually have anything against school in general)   need more horse time   okay random breakdown over, but seriously i haven't been able  to get to the barn for 6 whole days and it's driving me crazy "
"my horse was wild again but at least i didn't hit my head on the rafters over the jumps today   i'm sick of the mud and rain, my horse wants to go outside and play with his buddies"
my horse wants the rain to stop so he can play with his buddies and not be wild   i swear he tries to imitate a bouncy ball every time he doesn't get turnout 
<propmale> absolutly hated his hour long flat work session today   we did serpentines and tons of bending   he really hated my spurs and the fact i was making him go foreward too 
"i jumped 3ft 3in today  laugh  i didn't actually know i was jumping that till after my lesson though, lol"
"i jumped ground poles today, when the trainers away the kids will play lol i even got a \lesson\"" from one of the younger kids   had a good time though   just goofed off(within reason) with my horse who is the best!!!!!!!!!!!! and thinks he should jump ground poles hard   no denying he loves his job  even if he has to put up with me lol"""
