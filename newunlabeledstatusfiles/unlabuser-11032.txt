"ideas to live by: less is more; take one day at a time; do something for the kid in you every day; laugh; take your work seriously, but not yourself at all; have a forgiving attitude, most people are doing the best they can; be kind to unkind people (they probably need it the most); sit on your ego; talk less, listen more; remind yourself that you are not the general manager of the universe! thanks mom! love u  smile "
