one of the rat babies had it's foot in it's mouth just like a human baby!!! it was so adorable!!! i wish i could have had a picture of it!!!
took zuzu to the vet  she says it seems like something really small; gave us pain meds and sedatives so he will just stay off of it and give it some time to heal on it's own  he gets to be a drug zombie for about a week    poor zuzu 
"just found out two people from \the cottage\"" quit and a friend put in a good word for me there  i might have a paying job soon """

is very sick  got some preventative things though  will be staying in bed all day tomorrow so i can make it to the children's center monday  laugh 
"ugh, might have to go to the doctor again   i don't seem to be getting better "
"my throat hurts, my head hurts,i have a high fever,i can't breath out of my nose because it is stuffed up(can't breathe through my mouth because it hurts my throat),my ear also is beginning to hurt because it is stuffed up,so i can't hear out of one ear and my balance is shot,so i can't walk or drive,which means no children's center today and i can't go to class either, and i have to be driven to the doctor at 2  fml"

"so the <propfirst> phelps thing is annoying  i hope they don't get the counter-protest permit, i love the idea of an alternative event in the sub or whatever(was talking to <propfirst> in asl this morning)  it makes so much more sense to draw people away from them, then to go head to head people like them  i would definitely support an alternative event away from their protesting "
white coffee    the perfect beginning to a friday  smile 
"my weekend was full of cleaning, homework, and projects    except for today  today i put on sweatpants and relaxed    completely worth it "
