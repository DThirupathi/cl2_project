sick of wasting my time! the only people i want in my life are the people who want me in theirs   
"truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for \ -<propmale> marley"""
"i don't suffer from insanity, i enjoy every minute of it!"
my life is slowly beginning to change and i hope i'm ready for what's ahead   
"now the word out on the street\is the devil's in your kiss\if our love goes up in flames\it's a fire i can't resist"
â€œspiteful words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks your heart â€�
"you\ can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see, but you \cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel "
"\i sit here and wonder if you'll ever understand just how much of me belongs to you \"""""

"â€œi want to be remembered as the girl who always smiles even when her heart is broken, and the one that could always brighten up your day even if she couldn't brighten her own â€�"
"and now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names  we don't belong to no one, that's a shame but you could hide beside me maybe for a while, and i won't tell no one your name   "

i honestly don't even care anymore   
"some people believe that holding on and hanging in there are signs of strength  however, there are times in life in which it takes much more strength to let go"
"just gonna stand there and let me burn but that's alright\cuz i love the way it hurts \just gonna stand there and hear me cry, but that's alright\cuz i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie "

"i'm through accepting limits, 'cause someone says they're so \some things i cannot change, but till i try i'll never know \too long i've been afraid of losing love i guess i've lost \well, if that's love it comes at much too high a cost!"
"it's hard to wait around for something you know might never happen, but it's harder to give up when you know it's everything you want "
"sometimes we tend to be in despair when the person we love leaves us, but the truth is, it's not our loss, but theirs, for they left the only person who wouldn't give up on them "

"if shes amazing, she wont be easy  if shes easy, she wont be amazing  if shes worth it, you wont give up  if you give up, you're not worthy "
can't anything in my life run smoothly???
i hate it when people disappoint me especially when i didn't e playful ect much from them to begin with !
the best thing in the whole world is being able to see that someone loves you without them having to say it 
you will never know the value of love until you cry for it
me vs  the gre (round two)! all i ask is that my score reflect that my iq is higher than <propfemale> montag and snooki combined  i hope that's not asking for too much   
the gre won again and the weather matches my mood perfectly which isn't saying very much  sad 
has anyone noticed the decline of genuine people in this world or is it just me?
love is being able to see an imperfect person perfectly  if you can't do that then you'll never find love   
"protect her, fight for her, kiss her, love her, hold her, laugh with her  but don't make her fall, if you don't plan on catching her "
here we go steelers!!!!
stairway to 7   go steelers!!!!!!
"it breaks your heart when people you know become people you knew  when you can walk right past someone as if they were never a huge part of your life  you used to be able to talk for hours on the phone, and now you can't even look each other in the eye  it completely breaks your heart to know that good things don't last, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it "
"there are things that we don't want to happen but have to accept, things that we don't wanna know but have to learn, and people we cant live without but have to let go   "
the suspense is killing me   ;p
"i love you \don't use this phrase if u don't intend on proving it \love is an action "
"i'm currently making some changes in my life, so if you don't hear from me, then you're one of them"
"it's a shitty day out, think i'm getting sick, and i got my first rejection letter today  what a truly great valentines day   not!  sad "
god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you   happy <propfirst>'s baby!

in the middle of another quarter-life crisis   
"this world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me  -blink 182"
"when a girl sticks with liking 1 guy through all the crap he gives her, it doesn't mean she doesn't see it  it means she actually loves him   "
"\don't compromise yourself  you are all you've got \"" -<propfemale> joplin"""
