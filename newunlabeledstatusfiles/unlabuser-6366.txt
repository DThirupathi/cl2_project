i got obsessed and there's a million more quizzes to take!
well i'm over the quizzes for the moment          pretty uneventful weekend due to the fact i am on call for work   it sucks but at least i'll be happy when i get my paycheck!
playing the waiting game                i don't play very well!
made it through monday              
havin fun in rapid city this weekend             catching up with family and friends   what a nice weekend!
yay         peyton won his football game today!  go chiefs!
"well i finally cracked down and posted some pics for all you people who wouldn't lay off!  i hope ur all happy, enjoy       "
well i home alone for the night        scary   <propfirst> is working overnights and peyton is spending the night with a friend and now i am thinkin i should be staying the night with a friend           i always seem to hear things in my house when i am alone   i'm kind of a scaredy cat like that!
thank gosh <propfemale> will be here monday           our new roomie!
now my dog is freaking out for no reason      she doesn't bark unless something is there   this night is going to suck!
another test i guess            i have no <propfemale>!  don't plan on that changin        keep the tests comin 
"had a blast tonight with m&m, we can still actually party like rock stars!  oh now i need to get ready to kick some ass in tennis tomorrow!  well that would actually be later today i guess             "
"well won in volleyball last night, lost in darts tonight       can't win em all i guess   however i would like to             "
well what a day      glad it's over   got in a fender bender today         go figure it was in my own driveway and i backed into my sister's car        wtf!  all i can do is laugh at the irony i guess 
change does everyone good           hopefully it's down the road for me 
the weather sucks         don't know if i'll make it here in bismarck?  this will be as far north as i ever go            if i try someone please beat some sense into me!
wooh hooh       viks pulled out another win!  gotta love them
feeling restless and doin some soul searchin      not a high point in life 
takin it one day at a time          
"feeling a little disappointed      peyton's team just lost for 3rd place in the gold division of football  sad   oh well they had a good season, better luck next year   well off to see friends for fight night and cocktails!"
nothin like trying to get mentally get geared up for a monday          never easy 
tgif       however it's not as sweet          i'm on-call this weekend  sad   no halloween parties for me           
alright well yet another monday around the corner         i swear monday's are my nemesis 
waiting in any form is so not my thing                  maybe that's my <propfemale>?
yay     a day off tomorrow     even if it is midweek i'll take it!
uuuugh        i hate losin       and i am a sore one at that!!!  everywhere you look in life there's competition and i'm not about to quit 
"well it's official       happy thanksgiving to all my fb friends and enjoy your day with family, friends, and loved ones "
omg        the countdown has started!  black friday will soon be here and i can't wait  laugh   it's a shopper's dream           and everyone else's nightmare   happy shopping!
yay i'm done with call and can relax     sometimes you gotta just focus on the little things   the little joys in life             
i am trying to stay focused on the little things     but somehow the big things keep creeping up on me!
i'm so tired of freezin ass all the time     damn nd what was i thinkin????  i apparently wasn't      actually i was thinkin of <propfemale>!

"well goodbye 2009, and happy 2010     the start of another decade!  there's always a hopeful feeling to the start of a new year     just the significance alone   another year of life  smile   well happy new year everyone and have fun and be safe "
"i made it back to bismarck       survived driving thru the storm, deadwood on new year's <propfemale>, and the visit with my family!  loved it all and it was a great way to start 2011!  i'm very optimistic for the year ahead!"
boring black       on another note if i can handle the last 2 days in nd bring on antarctica or the north pole smile   i think i might know how it feels to be an eskimo       
betrayal is hard to handle in any form         but even moreso by a close friend and somebody you trusted  sad   however i am blessed enough to have barely dodged a bullet         it was that close 
well it was a nice mlk day        really didn't celebrate but it was a day of nothin   sometimes it's nice to have those days and just relax       aahh 
"hates difficult decisions, but it's better this way   nobody wins in these situations         "

hmmm      well sweethearts day is almost over   can't decide if i'm really into <propfirst>'s day or not?  i guess it changes by the year      
i've been a winner all week          yay!  maybe it's a sign i need to gamble or play the lottery this weekend?

love it when you wake up and the day seems like too much        but then you get coffee brought to you une playful ectingly!  one of those little serendipitous events             
"aahhh     peyton started 7th grade today        he's now an official \middleschooler \""  it's really kind of sad      i was helping him remember his lunch number plus his two locker combinations!  he asked me this morning \""mom what do i do when i get there!\""   sad """
what a day      at least i stood my ground!  gotta stand for something or you'll fall for everything        
so sick of people in general and how they always seem to disappoint  sad   tis the season for it i guess       maybe people think the same of me as well 
feels so good        a weight off my shoulders   don't why i didn't do this sooner       ridding my life of the garbage   literally and figuratively!
hhmmm        kind of ironic it's native american day and i'm working  sad 
"back to the grindstone!  oh well it was a lovely weekend with good company and cheers to digital cigs, home theatre systems, and don't forget the guns!  oh and the snoring        "
yay ohio and <propfemale> here i come! fun times to come!
