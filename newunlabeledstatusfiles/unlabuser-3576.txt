just donated 16 inches of hair to locks of love    my hair is purrrtty short  will put up a picture when i get one!!!
love when people assume i sit here and stalk their facebook pages all day long  yea like have have nothing better to do  at all   
"god, please help me make the right choices "
some times i feel like i have no one to phyisically turn to when i need someone 
"our world is full of tattooed bodies, pierced faces, and rainbow hair and no one thinks twice about it, but here i am simple girl with a scarf on and the whole world looks at me "
"i am addicted to someone, but my cure is 3600 <propmale> away "
"if being happy with the man i love and living all my dreams is the same thing as being a nut job, then i dont want to be normal  i am happy i am a nut job!!!!!!!!"
thank you everyone for the birthday wishes
