some times there is pain that everyone goes through pain that is unimaginable to one person and the other its no big deal   but there is always one person that gets hurt way more than anyone else and its usually by the person you love the most it hurts way too much
sometimes there is just too much to handle and time is in your hands and all you got is the pain
truth is everybody is going to hurt you  you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for --<propmale> marley    i found one but <propmale> never said anything about it hurting this much
