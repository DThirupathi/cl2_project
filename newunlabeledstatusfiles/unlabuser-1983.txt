i'm ready to be at home in my own bed     and to not be in a hotel instead   
its funny how singing <propfirst> <propfirst> songs down the freeway makes time go by faster   
you know you're home when you forget to feed the dog and you have more stuff to unload out of the car 
i am tired and annoyed and happy and excited and    confused by all of that    i think i better go to bed earlier tonight    
its not right to be in a classroom before the school year has even started!
"finally watched the rest of pirates of the caribbean   one of the best movies ever!!!  thanks for letting me borrow the movies, vampire and sherlock  you might not get them back   smile "
"finally get to relax after an afternoon of innertubing, knee boarding, and watching people wipe out on water skiis with some of my buddies   fun fun time   smile "
my cat attacked my arm 5 minutes ago and he is now sleeping soundly on my bed   weird cat   
hoping that i will be able to sleep without any interuptions tonight     i need it

"can't stop listening to just the way you are by <propmale> mars   its too addicting   of course, i think a lot of songs are addicting "
"hold on baby you're losing it, the water's high you're jumping into it, and letting go and no one knows   "
"super annoyed when someone texts you, you answer, then they decide to never answer your question   and to make it better, they're on fb the same time as you and when you try to send them a message, they log off!!!! grrr!!!!!!"
having a whose line is it anyway? marathon from recorded episodes off the dvr  one of the best shows ever!

"just saw one kid in a mcdonald's fries costume, another in a hamburger costume, and four guys in dresses  all at the track meet  today is one weird day "
one word to describe the past 24 hours: awesome 
"september is cancer month: in memory of every cancer patient, family member and friend who has lost their battle with cancer, and in honor ofthose who continue to conquer it! put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has or had cancer  many won't copy and paste, i did  will you?"

"i see your face every time i dream,\on every <propfemale>, every magazine,\so wild and free, so far from me,\you're all i want, my fantasy   \     \love this song!!!!!!"
just heard <propfirst>'s girl on the tv and thought of only one thing: dancing to <propfemale>'s house after the football game last week   smile

ducks and beavers won their games!!!!!!!!! awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
"and my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say,\may have lost this battle, live to fight another day,\but don't be falling in love as she's walking away   "
"working today makes me feel excited for tuesday and very annoyed at the same time \2 days!!!"
"next time i say i'm gonna make a last minute playlist for a float, talk me out of it   or at least get other people who keep coming up with ideas for songs get off their butts and have them make it themselves \1 day!!!"
"can't decide if today was a good day or bad day  plus side: we beat the seniors in the float competition and are super close to winning the homecoming competition  minus side: it's been exactly one year since my grandpa passed away and when i got home, i found out my dad had to put to sleep our 11-year-old lab "
its amazing how little kids and a jack-in-the-box can change ur mood so easily 
love those days when you're lazy and move at your own pace  today is one of those days  i need it 
going to the dance after staying up to 11 all week and running on 7 and a half hours of sleep is not fun  but singing bleeding love is 
school tomorrow   bleh   
"i'd go back in time to change it, but i can't   \so if the chain is on your door, i understand   "
"don't make me mad and i won't give you a death glare \simple as that "
watching <propmale> potter and the half-blood <propmale>  i now really want to read the series again    go four day weekends!
who's going to the game tonight?
"toughgirls come from new york, sweet girls come from texas, <propfemale> girls come from california, but us oregon girls have fire & ice in our blood, we can ride 4-wheelers, be a <propfemale>, throw a right hook, love football, fish with the boys, bake a cake, be great moms, party   and   love with a passion, and if we have an opinion, u know you are gonna hear it !!! copy and paste if you are a oregon girl!!"

"now i can't laugh, can't cry   \and i can't run, can't hide   \what do i gotta do, what do i gotta do to keep you,\what do i gotta do to keep you from doing this to me   "
"so tomorrow is a late start and i have to be at school by 6:45   \does this make sense to anyone???????????"
"at this moment, there is only one thing to say   \i love my ducks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
watching my dad trying to play on the wii fit makes my day 
"every person has 1000 wishes, a cancer patient only has one: to get better  i know that 97% won't post this as their status- be one of the 3% and post this as your status  do it for at least an hour, for those who have died of cancer or for those who are still fighting  ?"
"she would change everything for happily ever after,\caught in the inbetween, a beautiful disaster   "
i hate when the power goes out   
"the thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes \another love grows cold on a sleepless night \as the storm blows on out of control \deep in her heart, the thunder rolls   "
my poor baby girl (aka <propfirst> bear) is freaked out by the thunder  can't wait till she hides in the shower again 
"i will dry your eyes, i will fight your fights, i will hold you tight and i won't let go   \absolutely love this song  smile "
"crazy crazy week    my day was made thanks to captain <propfirst> sparrow   smile \and one crazy weekend coming up!!!\can't wait!!!!!!"
"sooooooooooooooooooooo tired   \but soooooooooooooooooooo excited at the same time "
i hate it when i think i make people feel bad 
"i am taking all of the mirrors out of our house and throwing them all outside, then making sure no one goes near them "
"my cat decided to run up the stairs, throw up on every stinkin step, and let me clean it all up afterwards  and to thank him, i threw him outside "
"look what i got! i gotta a jar of dirt, i gotta jar of dirt, and guess what's inside it!!!!"
"but on second thought, tonight i think i hate everything   "
i  hate  internet 
finally things are going my way 
"the more i think about it, the more i wish i was in idaho"
"i guess it's gonna break me down\like fallin' when you try fly\it's sad but sometimes\moving on with the rest your life\starts with goodbye   "
"i really want it to be tomorrow night so i can watch the cma awards!!! \and also so that i can sleep in the next day   smile "
"song of the day: welcome to my life \great song "
just because i know a lot of country songs does not mean that i am a sick freak or a computer  country music is just my forte   smile 
"cma awards are on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\and if weren't guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this   \love <propfemale> underwood!  smile "
"i'd come for you, no one but you\yes, i'd come for you, but only if you told me to\i'd fight for you, i'd lie, it's true\give my life for you\you know i'd always come for you   "
"we think about tomorrow then it slips away, oh, yes it does\we talk about forever but we've only got today\and the days go by\i can feel 'em flying like a hand out the window when the cars go by\it's all we've been given, so you better start livin'\you better start livin'\better start livin' right now   "
already fed up and mad and the week has barely started  wonderful 
"so if nobody cares, what's the point in trying?"
seriously confused and has no idea what is going on at the moment   and hoping that i didn't sound very mean either   
"according to my dad, he is the \cool <propfirst> guy next door\""   """
ready for a long break from school 
it's a rainbow!!!!!
"i want to be loved like that, \i want to be loved like that, \a promise you can't take back, \if you're gonna love me, \i want to be loved like that   "
"oh, i know you can hear me\but i'm not sure you're listening\i hear what you're sayin'\but still there's somthing missin'\whether i go, whether i stay\right now depends on whatever you say   "
"would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire?\would you hold on to me tighter, as the summer sun got higher?\if we roll from town to town, and never shut it down?\would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover?\would we walk even closer, until the trip was over?\and would it be okay if i didn't know the way   "
"happy birthday, dad!!! you may not have a facebook, but i'm saying it on here anyway   smile  love you!!!!!"
"life on the <propfemale> couldn't be any stranger,\life on the <propfemale> wouldn't feel this far away?\the life that i knew is through\and i'm gonna need you more than ever,\i'm alone in this crowded room,\its like life on the <propfemale>   "
"who's there to save the hero,\when she's left all alone\and she's crying out for help,\who's there to save the hero,\who's there to save the girl,\after she saves the world   "
"so don't give up now, you're so close to a brand new day,\yes, you are,\and if you just can't bare to be alone, then i'll stay   "
"cleaned my room and most of downstairs, moved my old dresser into the computer room, read an awesome book, relaxed, and spent time with family  i would classify that as a pretty great weekend   smile "
"where a closet used to be in my room is now a huge hole in the wall, just waiting to have shelves put in it and to be painted  looking forward to tomorrow!"
"no matter how many fb friends you have, no matter how many people you talk to during the day, not very many people will care what you have to say, what you've done, or how you feel  a small amount of people will honestly care  glad i know who those people are in my life "
"and i hate how much i love you, boy\i can't stand how much i need you\and i hate how much i love you, boy\but i just can't let you go\and i hate that i love you so   "
"beavers: fight hard\ducks: fight harder and win  smile "
"what do you say? the ducks won? what else is new?\i love my ducks!!!  smile "
"i\don't need an angel on my christmas tree  i already have one in heaven \looking down on me        put this on your status if there is someone \in heaven you wish could be with you this christmas!!!"
"tell me how would you feel,\you'd probably give up too,\if nobody believed in you   "
ready for winter break    really need it 
it's time to make    a giant cookie pizza!!!!!!!
"yesterday    can't even put into words how much fun it was! lip sync went great, had fun decorating the dance, and everything else that happened was just awesome! today was great too, can't wait to sleep in tomorrow   smile "
"obsessed, depressed at the same time\i can't even walk in a straight line\i'm a light in the dark, no sunshine\no sunshine, no sunshine   "
"there ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh yeah,\why won't you answer me?\the silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah   \\kind of on a maroon 5 kick right now  smile "
so glad tomorrow is friday!!! and yet i have to wake up early      no bueno 
pretty sure i'm getting sick    have a sore throat and really tired    but at least today was a good day  so glad it's winter break   smile 
"thank you, thunderstorm, for waking me up from my peaceful sleep with your thunder and hail "
watching pretty woman and eating fudge    awesome way to end an awesome day   smile 
getting ready to go to my granny's house for her birthday  can't wait to see the family   smile 
"once upon a time there was light in my life \but now there's only love in the dark \nothing i can say \a total eclipse of the heart   "
"today: christmas <propfemale>, saw my cat play in a plastic bag, got new wireless internet, went back to best buy to fix the router for the internet, figured out i will be a geek squad employee, with delicious dinner and games tonight  gotta love the holidays   smile "
"very much enjoyed yesterday   smile  after waking up too early, the day got a million times better  i am now enjoying a marathon of season 5 of criminal minds and am ready to wear my new duck t-shirt, much to my dad's dismay   smile  hope everyone else had a great christmas!"
this weather is crazy    ton of wind and rain    wonderful   
oh so very confused   and i don't like it at all 
"even though i'm feeling so right, \i'm so happy still i know\i should be sleeping instead of dreaming\about you   "
two options: finish pride and prejudice notes for 50 points of extra credit by tomorrow for honors or keep my sanity and get some sleep tonight  kinda leaning towards the second one at this point   
"pain is hard to get out, just like paint   smile "
"we ride and never worry about the fall,\i guess that's just the cowboy in us all   "
"if i run, will you run after me? \if i walk, will you wait patiently? \if i fall, will you have sympathy? \if i run, if i run, \will you run after me?"
let no one who loves be unhappy; even love unreturned has its rainbow 
"she loves her mama's lemonade\and hates the sound that goodbye's make\she prays one day she'll find someone to need her\she swears that there's no difference\between the lies and compliments\it's all the same if everybody leaves her   "
"if somebody could please snap their fingers and make my internet work again, it would be very much appreciated   smile "
four days till internet access! and i'm already having itunes withdrawel   
"thank you, awesome internet-installer guy, for allowing me to go back onto itunes once again!!!  laugh "
"the smile on your face let's me know that you need me\there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me\the touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever i fall\you say it best when you say nothing at all   "
"it's like my heart is a tooth, and it has a cavity that can only be filled with children   \gotta love despicable me   smile \papoy!!!"
"so maybe you could walk with me a while\maybe i could rest beneath your smile\everybody stumbles sometimes \and needs a hand to hold\cause it's a long trip alone   "
stutter by maroon 5 has been stuck in my head all weekend    at least it's a great song   laugh 
i've lost count of how many times i've updated people's ipods   
"there's once in a lifetime, and there's once in a while\and the difference between the two is about a million miles\oh, you might get lucky while the <propfemale> is looking on\but in the truth of the morning\the stars will be long gone   "
singing to sappy love songs (thanks twin) and feeling hyper tired    great way to end an awesome day   smile 
still trying to get used to having a green room   
"because i'm broken when i'm open \and i don't feel like i am strong enough \cause i'm broken when i'm lonesome \and i don't feel right when you're gone away   "
"according to my dad, \nacho\"" is 3 in spanish and \""cheeso\"" is 4    the things my family say   """
"i don't want to feel better,\i don't want to not remember, \i will always see your face in the shadows of this haunted place,\i will laugh, i will cry, shake my fist at the sky,\but i will not say goodbye   "
you know the weather's bad when a usual 15 minute trip home takes 45 minutes   
"for the first time you can open your eyes, and see the world without your sorrow, where no one knows the pain you've left behind, and all the peace you could never find is waiting there to hold you, keep you, welcome to the first day of your life, just open up your eyes   \favorite daughtry song at the moment   smile "
"<propfirst> cook has a new song!!!!!!!\my day has been officially made   laugh "
"i'll stand by you, i'll stand by you\i won't let nobody hurt you\i'll stand by you\take me in, into your darkest hour\and i'll never desert you\i'll stand by you   \this song is on repeat on my ipod at the moment   smile "
and i thought the weather was bad in <propmale>   
"so happy that my aunt got down here from idaho safely   smile  \can't wait until i get to see her this weekend!!!  laugh "
"make the world go away,\and get it off my shoulders,\say the things you used to say,\and make the world go away   "
dinner with aunt <propfirst> and the family equals lots of laughter   smile 
"mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood \miss 'no way, it's all good', it didn't slow me down \mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated \look i'm still around   \ love  this song"
"dancing slowly in an empty room\can the lonely take the place of you?\i sing myself a quiet lullaby\then you go and let the lonely in\to take my heart again    love "
this was one awesome day   smile 
"loving the country music awards   smile \but <propfemale> underwood's performance has been the best of the night  no doubt about that   smile "
