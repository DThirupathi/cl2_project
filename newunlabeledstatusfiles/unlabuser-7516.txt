"is deciding who and what is worthy of keeping in my life  it's come time for a change, a new direction, a new beginning perhaps "
"message to all please let me know if you see or hear of anywhere that is hiring in utah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\please?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
has  learned its so hard to please everyone  but so easy to make them all mad at the same time  crying 
when family hates you it shows just how bad their life is and they have to hate someone  when family talks about you it shows they don't have a life 
"i would really rather have just a few true friends in my life than a \lot of untrustworthy ones  if you take offense to this, guess which kind\ you are!"
i will always be daddy's little girl! no matter what happens! i love my grand-dad!
"i want everyone to answer this one question annoyed \if you could only say one sentence to me for the rest of your life, what would it be? \\(good or bad) just be 100% honest!!!! please i dont care what your answer is just tell me if i didn't want to know i wouldnt ask!"
"while some people think i have an attitude problem, i think some people have the stuck on stupid problem which leads me to want to smack the stupid out of them!!"
"while\ some people think i have an attitude problem, i think some people have \the stuck on stupid problem which leads me to want to smack the stupid \out of them!!    (this is to those who dont know how to mind their own business and just want to cause problems for anyone else they can just because you are miserable doesnt mean you need to try to make other that way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"

"its amazing how one person can make you see how happy you really can be and at the same time how you have been living without happiness  never cheat yourself \\live as if there's no tomorrow, love as if your heart is bursting, & laugh so hard that you can't breathe   "
"i'm not crazy, i'm clinically insane  trust me, there's a difference "

ever wonder what the world would be like if nobody was able to tell lies?
"yeah, i knew it was wrong but i did anyway!!!  get over it!!!!"
"life is full of choices, make them, live with them    but don't e playful ect everyone else to embrace them "
ever come to the realization that someone you thought was a good friend was not really a friend at all?
step-parents that care for and love their step-kids like they would their own are special parents  smile  being a good step-parent is an honor that is earned!
