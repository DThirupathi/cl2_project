"42; you have always been an amazing person  randomly, i will catch myself thinking about our part and how exceptionally wonderful it was  it also makes me realize how special i was to you, and you with me  i will always regret losing you, but the past is the past i suppose  i still want to maintain the friendship we always have, and i hope to see you again soon "
"i am on my phone currently, and t9 sucks  send me <propfirst>, i will answer them when i get back home "
"2142; i still sort of remember one of the first times i ever saw you  it was about 3 years ago or so, when i still lived at the apartment  i thought you were quite gorgeous (and still do), and thought you acted very silly (in a good way)  i came to really like your personality, and a lot of things about you actually, and developed a crush on you "
"5623; you know, it's been quite some time since we've last saw each other  a lot of my favorite memories of us hanging out were the apartment  like whenever the whammy bar on <propfirst>'s guitar broke because of <propfirst> and i's elaborate plan   laugh  that shit is still funny to this day looking back  you've always been a pretty great friend, and our friendship will continue on! we need to see each other more often, though "

"996; i miss you, and i love you! i'm sure we will see each other again very soon, but let's make it sooner just to be sure  we've known each other for a long time, fond memories seem to pop into my mind from years ago  but, they are all good memories, and we have never had any bad ones!    not really, anyway   playful  also, i suddenly have the odd sensation to consume fish and berries  run e>"
"1217; whenever we talk, i'm instantly taken back to those very memories you mentioned  our first kiss on the elevator, our walk on the beach, sitting in that odd hallway with other friends and talking about things i can't exactly remember  and also   <propfirst> was there too, i believe?"
\the state (game) has been \,e173b1dd17034a46fd046437e70304c0,"113; we have quite a history that goes back quite a ways  lots of good times, some weird times  i remember we used to <propfemale> out like all the time, and sneak over to your house and such  we need to <propfemale> out again soon!"
