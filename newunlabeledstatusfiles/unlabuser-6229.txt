"is playing d&d along with <propfemale>, <propfirst>, and <propfirst>   i am such a nerd "
just thinking   at this time 6 years ago i just got to the hospital in placerville and plopped into a bed to have a baby fall out 
weee   just a few more days till the solstice 
just spent the last 10 minutes giving a fast and loose e playful laination of vodu thanks to the <propfemale> and the frog
's muscles are all shakey from working out weee    
is bonding with the dog on the couch and doing math homework 
i blame <propfirst> for contributing to the down fall of society 
"today's horoscope is starting to feel really really accurate    after weeks of being nice to everyone around you, regardless of whether  or not they deserved it, you're just about ready to let your true  feelings be known  that  means the good ones and the not-so-good ones  ready or not    "
is reveling in the quiet of a day off  
"in\flanders fields the poppies blow\between\the\ crosses row on row,\that\mark\ our place; and in the sky\the\larks,\ still bravely singing, fly\scarce\heard\ amid the guns below \we\are the dead  short days ago\we\lived,\ felt <propfemale>, saw sunset glow,\loved\and\ were loved, and now we lie\in\flanders\ fields "
"ahh rain thank gods, now if only it didn't feel so humid!"
is all worn out but it's been a good day thus far   thanks for lunch <propfirst> was great to catch up 
had a lot of fun at the annual luncheon for the chief taughannock chapter of the nsdar   looking forward to many more to come 
hope everyone had a good solstice
"<propfemale> walks in and says \no homework!\"" we say \""oh really?\"" then she follows up with \""i left before i could put it in my folder so yeah its too late now!\"""""
