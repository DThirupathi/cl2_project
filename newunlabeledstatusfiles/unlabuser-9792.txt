"people\ need to understand that children  with special needs don't have an \illness, so there is no cure & it's  not contagious  they only want \what we all want, to be accepted  93%  probably won't copy and paste \this  will you do it and leave it on your  status for at least an hour? \it's special education week, and this    is in  honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding"
if anyone has heard from my mom and dad or my brother please let me know  thanks
