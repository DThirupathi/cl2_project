"i have always embraced computers as a way to organize oneâ€™s thoughts and e playful and oneâ€™s mind  i do not regret my choices, but on occasion i admit that it has weakened me somewhat  to extend oneâ€™s mind in this manner comes at the cost of fracturing it  though it impedes me on occasion, on the whole it has served me well, and in the future the technique can only be improved \\#cyborgs"

"there are some things that you just can't get away from, and it's not a matter of running away or facing them  they are too ubiquitous to escape and too intrinsic to defy  to lose them is to lose yourself, and losing one's self lays to waste all hope of knowing anything at all "
