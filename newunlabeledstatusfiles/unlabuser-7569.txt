i'm beginning to wonder how <propmale> and zavier are even still alive lol i swear those kids never eat anything!
what happens if the banana doesn't fit in the hammock?
"ohhhhhh back to school, back to school to prove to dad i'm not a fool  got my lunch packed up, my nike's tied tight, hope i don't get in a fight    "
omg!!! zavier just pooped on the toilet!!! haha who knew poop could be so exciting?
at the touch of love everyone becomes a poet-plato <---- that guy knows whats up

"i'm definitely not liking this anatomy and physiology stuff   mainly cuz i have nowere quiet to study  poop, i say, poop!"
going to take the kids to the zing zang zoom circus tonight   victor's over here splarting with anticipation
caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror this morning and about died laughing   i looked crazy lol <propfirst> must really love me to see that and not run away hahahaha

<---- this is what love looks like &hearts; <propfirst> canales you mean the world to me!
uggghhhhhhh    i can't sleep but i'm soooooo tired  sad 
"zavier just pointed to my throat and said \is it the haha\"""""
"\how do you keep your ***hole so clean?\""      hahahahahahahha"""
"out of boredom at 2 in the morning, <propfirst> and i discovered that it sounds hilarious when you fart on a metal door"
"say you love someone and tell them they are important to you all you want, but if you don't have the heart to show them with your actions maybe it's time to rethink what you say"
it's t-shirrrrt tiiiimmmme!
<propfirst> got me flowers   he's so sweet &hearts;
i need winter clothes but i can never find anything!!! sometimes i hate being little lol
dying my hurrrrrr    going out with <propfemale> tonight!!! yeah <propmale>!
"ohhhh man i have such a bad headache today   i dont even drink, but i feel like i'm always the one with a hangover after a night out lol"
"i farted next to zavier and he got mad and yelled \go poop on the toilet!!!\"""""
"so i was studying for biology and <propmale> picked up one of the books and i kept telling him leave it alone, but he kept opening it   come to find out he kept trying to look at the female anatomic models ,which we all know in a biology book, are naked   oh geez"
and another breaking news story   i was giving <propmale> a shower and found a leaf in his buttcrack!!! wtf is going on in here today lol
"time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?"
taking the kids trick or treating in a little bit   i'm hoping to find the battery charger for my camera so i can take pictures
"so that was a waste of time   this church had trunk or treating and we stood in line for an hour and a half and only got to five cars before <propmale> started saying he was too cold   maybe if people would just pass out <propfemale> at their houses like they used to, trick or treating would actually be fun"
"conÂ·sidÂ·erÂ·aÂ·tion [kuhn-sid-uh-rey-shuhn]: thoughtful or sympathetic regard or respect; thoughtfulness for others\\a k a -something you can't e playful ect from someone who doesn't respect themselves"
well i bought some shoes today and one pair came with 2 right shoes   damn it lol
i don't think i will ever understand why people put their kids on a leash   i think i would be really embarrassed to do that lol
"<propmale> just said \when i get big i'm going to be brown like my dad\"" lmao i'm now wondering if he thinks all people are white when they're little?"""
"well i forgot to thaw out something for dinner    what to eat, what to eat?"
there is a difference between naked and nekkid   nekkid is when you are naked and up to something
made homemade portobello mushroom meatballs earlier   good god they are scrumptious lol
"<propfirst> was getting ready to get in bed last night, shuts the light off then says in a sing song voice \i have a surprise for you\""    i heard a lighter click then next thing i know whoosh!   he lit his fart on fire!!!"""
i think people fail to realize that when you're in a relationship you can't do the same things you did when you were single   you would figure that its common sense
"after working on a school paper all day, most people would say they need a drink   i, myself, need pizza!!! eating junk is my \getting drunk\"""""
confucius says: toilet of <propfemale> ship enterprise contain 'captains log' 
homework overload! my brain has reached capacity   can't wait for those 3 weeks off!!!
whatever happened to workplaces giving out hams or turkeys or boxes of steaks for christmas? <propfirst> just got a card size collage of family portaits from his boss in the mail for christmas lmao   wtf is that?
"god, i hate when people are just flat out inconsiderate, always putting their own wants before everyone elses needs   i can't for the life of me understand how people can treat others that way"
can't sleep   ugh have to be up in 4 hours and have finals tomorrow  sad 
there is no greater sorrow than to recall in misery the time when we were happy
"got a little bit more christmas shopping to do   maybe i'll do that today? i gotta get <propfirst> something funny, maybe a big box of packing peanuts with fake poop in the bottom   just cuz he'd be all excited cuz the box is so big lol"
"so i decided i would get <propfirst> a nice normal gift: some books   \what's your poo telling you\"" and \""farts:a spotters guide\"" hahahaha"""
"<propfirst> is out shopping for a gift for me with his friend, i'm sure alcohol will be involved in their trip lol i can only imagine the ideas those 2 silly asses will come up with lmao"
<propmale> said he thinks <propfemale> put him on the naughty list   he looked a little panicked hahahaha
thanks everyone for the birthday wishes   hope everyone has a good christmas
"to all the people who complain about kids crying in stores, next time you're rude or cop an attitude with someone, maybe someone should suggest that you should have been left at home   if you're not a parent, don't attempt to give advice on parenting or think for one second that you can even imagine what it's like, you'll only make a fool out of yourself, you can't control any human being, even a child"
i forgot how much i hate boxed chocolates   disgusting!!!
somebody took a poop in my toilet and it won't flush   looks like some witches brew hahahahaha disgusting
not wanting something is as good as possessing it 
"i'm frickin starving over here   it's like what smokey said, we ain't never got 2 things that match"
"a man does not mind being blamed for his faults, and being punished for them, and he patiently suffers for them; but he becomes impatient if he is required to give them up    guess that's why we gotta love them the way they are lol"
"<propmale> and zavier are the only little kids i know that love raw vegetables   if i cook with <propfemale> peppers, they mysteriously disappear when my back is turned lol"
"i think i need a vacation, just for a couple days, with some girlfriends   need to put some things in perspective, this same old shit has to go"
dog whisperer is crackin me up   little crazy devil dogs
saw a news story about a guy who stabbed 4 people because they made fun of him for farting   guess maybe he's just not the type of person that thinks farts are funny?
where is my remote?!?!?! i just had it! ugh
so i went to give zavier some medicine this morning and noticed it was the wrong color liquid   turns out the babysitter put adult robitussin in an infant medicine container!!! wtf?!?! good thing i noticed before i gave it to him
"somehow it says that i posted on people's wall about some profile stalker app   not too sure what happened, but that wasn't me, sorry everyone"
to <propmale> the peole who have a newborn or will be having a baby soon   my he<propmale>th teacher said today that there was a study on sids and they found that when they used bedding and clothing that didn't have flame retardant chemic<propmale>s in them that the sids rate dropped by quite a bit   just something to keep in mind
i need to do homework   i'm being lazy  sad 
pretty funny some of the adult humor thats hidden in cartoons
does anyone know of a good bakery in or near holland? zanes birthday is coming up and creations by <propfemale> is closed  sad 
"<propfirst>'s horoscope lmao-changes can happen at any time in your life  every step you take today could be approaching a <propmale> turning point, what you thought was important suddenly doesn't seem so, what you never considered much before becomes vital  this shift in priorities is long overdue  it might not be comfortable at first, but it will ultimately be the best thing to ever happen to you "
"i need to get my eyebrows tattooed on    gotta find a good place though, can't have them looking like <propfirst> and his purple crayon <propfirst> them on"
taking <propfirst> to vosges chocolate in chicago for <propfirst>'s day!!!!
thinking of taking the kids to the children's museum in chicago in a couple weekends   they would probably like riding the train there better than the actual museum
"<propfirst> said \i hate to toot my own horn but\""   then he farted and then <propmale> said \""well what kind of horn is it\"""""
we're going to see <propfirst> tosh at the fox on march 4th!!! super excited!!
had so much fun in chicago yesterday with my love  smile  the guess store was amazing! bought the most e playful ensive outfit i've ever bought in my life lol but it was way worth it
"at about 6 this morning, i was awoken by <propfirst> attempting to sing opera at the top of his lungs while he was in a dead sleep lmao"
"since the kids are with their dad and <propfirst> is at work, i should be doing homework     but i think i'll take a nap instead! couldn't go back to sleep after <propfirst>'s opera singing cuz i couldn't stop laughing"
<propmale> is 5 years old today    that little turd is getting old lol where does the time go?
"well, i attempted to go clean the car off but its caked in ice    brrrrrr its cold!"
"just brought home a mouth model and zavier says \is it hungry? does it want to eat?\"" then starts shoving food in between the teeth lmao"""
