life is nothing but the vessel in which your soul moves from one point to another  suicide is nothing but a waste of time and all it does is move you back to the point you began  your soul restarts and you have to go through a worse life  until you move through this life you have nothing better to do  ride through this vessel and love your soul  just remember to respect death  and     give the grim reaper a hug 
"the mind is a powerful thing  people always waste it  their full potential will never be realized  but once you realized how powerful your mind is you are able to detach from mortal bonds and raise up about the rest, showing superiourity to those below you  break your bonds and take charge  the fates have nothing on you break the loom  control your own string  manuver how you want  it is all yours for the taking "
"your enemies have the ability to poke and prod at you, they know your every weakness, even if you dont show it, the fates have conspired against you  these creatuers of darkness and light stand against you, take your weapon, ready yourself, destroy everything in your path  its yours for the taking  everything  destroy the ones who destroy you  fight  win  you are immortal, so prove it to everyone "
"your destruction is on its way, spreading like a fire, consuming everyone that is close to you before finally taking you, slowly driving you to insanity  but your insanity doesnt stop the pain, it just makes your life pass by slower, letting you feel the pain for longer, slowly burning your skin  you manage to sweat a bit, cool your life down just a touch and then the flames engulf you once again "
"ive never known trust like the knights, they are my family, for family is much more than blood, we are perfection together, we shant be destroyed nor seperated, death shall never catch us  we will destroy all in our way  let it be spoken, let it be screamed, we will never ever take us alive  we wont be forgotten we'll never give in  wolves forever, okamigimi for eternity "
i gots dragons blood  now my room will smell like insence again
