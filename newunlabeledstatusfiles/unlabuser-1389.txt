i find it elevating and exilerating to discover that we live in a universe which allows the evolution of molecular machines as intricate and subtle as we   
the e playful loration of the cosmos is a voyage of self discovery as long as there have been humans we have searched for our place in the cosmos <propfirst> sagan
"[sagan] as the ancient mythmakers knew we're children equally of the earth and the sky in our tenure on this planet, we've accumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage we've also acquired compassion for others, love for our children, and a great soaring passionate intelligence the clear tools for our continued survival"
the beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it but the way those atoms are put together the cosmos is also within us we're made of <propfemale> stuff we are a way for the cosmos to know itself across the sea of space the <propfemale>s are other suns we have traveled this way before and there is much to be learned <propfirst> sagan

"i would love to believe that when i die i will live again, that some  thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue  but much as i  want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural  traditions that assert an afterlife, i know of nothing to suggest that  it is more than wishful thinking ---carl sagan"
"who is more humble? the scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us, or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved? --<propfirst> sagan "
