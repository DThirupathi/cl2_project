so my dad confused the ending of 'rain man' with the ending from 'of mice and men ' the whole time i was watching the movie i kept waiting for <propmale> cruise to kill <propmale> hoffman 
i say we all join forces and shoot <propfemale> duff for trying to remake '<propfemale> and <propfirst>' whose with me!?!
whoever chose to see <propfirst> <propmale> for the new york trip is going to be very satisfied and amazed at how great it is!
"i'm not trying to criticize <propmale> kubrick or anything, but, what's with the <propmale> bear blow job scene in the shining? kinda ruined the mood "
