"discovered the hard way that the hot water was out this morning  broke record speeds finishing my morning grooming ritual, but took another 20 minutes under the covers with central heat on full blast to recover  brrrrrrr     "
"just got out of the hospital after 5 days, 5 mri's, one brain scan, one cardio echogram thingy, one doppler ultrasound groin scan and more picks, pokes, prods and tests to last a life time  glad to be home  i go back to work (gently) march 1st "
"several have asked why i was in the hospital  saturday on feb  13 i had a massive headache  it abated slightly but the night ended with me in a stroke, something incredibly rare for someone as young as i, and as a result the docs all rallied to find why  once they administered a miracle drug and began grueling tests, it turns out, i had a small slight hole in my heart, something since birth  but i'm truly blessed "
"man, this blood thinner medicine is making me feel fantastic! and no, i'm not kidding  i can't remember the last time i felt this good  tons 'o energy, sharper mind, no longer winded at the slight amount of effort  i should have had a stroke years ago    wait, i did! they just didn't catch this problem back then! lol seriously, i don't even feel like the same old tired, crappy pre-hospitlization self "
"doc ordered increase of blood thinner to reach the appropriate inr levels  i was 1 2, now am at 1 4  there is some confusion by my doc as to whether my inr level should be between 2 0 to 3 0 rather than 1 7 as the er docs recommended  i'm pretty close to reaching the latter 1 7 level, but much further away from the former  either way, each increase (so far) is an improvement in vitality and overall energy levels "
trying to think of something clever to say  anyone have any ideas? lol
"update: had followup with hematologist today  first, as e playful ected, he upped my dosage, something i was already advocating because it makes me feel so much better  secondly, he strongly recommended i see a cardiologist and have the hole in my heart repaired  he feels this has been causing problems for a very long time (since my 20s) and should be resolved soon  luckily, it's minorly invasive and a quick recovery "
"cardiologist called to schedule an appointment  i'm so excited, i almost can't wait the three weeks for the consultation  they likely will have me do two procedures both to look at the heart, and please don't ask me to say them; the receptionist said them too fast  i'll find out later and update you guys  tick tock    it's starting to come together "
"can't wait until i meet the cardiologist on tuesday  i'll have a long list for him, but most of all, can they really fix my congenital heart defect (hole)? i'm so excited  also, my inr finally reached the right levels! flying high now!"
