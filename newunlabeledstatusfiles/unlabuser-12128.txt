"<propfirst> gibbons: so i was sitting in my cubicle today, and i realized, ever since i started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it  so that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life  \dr  swanson: what about today? is today the worst day of your life? \\<propfirst> gibbons: yeah  \\dr  swanson: wow, that's messed up "
with the first game of the preseason starting today the lakers start their march to a threepeat!
