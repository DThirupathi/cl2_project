"sometimes, you just have to smile, pretend everything's okay, hold back the tears and walk away  if you want to see the rainbow you must go through the rain  if you want true love you must go through the pain  women were made from a man's rib, not from his head to be superior, not from his feet to be walked on, but from his side to be equal, from under the arm to be protected, and from next to the heart to be loved "
can't wait for the day when i have my own stuff and the only person i'll have to call on for help is god and no other

"taking an innocent or guilty person's life never solves anything  revenge isn't the answer  no one walking this earth is god nor is anyone as powerful as him, so what gives us the right to take any man's life? absolutely nothing  murder is murder, therefore it's a sin  r i p  <propfirst> <propmale>"

i loves me some cool cold weather!
"usually i have an answer for everything, school related ha, but i suck at this life crap so i don't care anymore wtbs: such a beautiful day guess i'll take advantage of it, when i get off!"
"work, study, eat, sleep; the life of a college student"
"having a pretty good day, hoping no one or anything messes it up"
relationships are so overrated
"never lead a girl on, make it clear from the beginning where you're trying to go with her, keeps confusion down and saves her from hurt feelings    just saying"
"when you got something good hold on to it, because someone else is waiting for you to slip up and take your spot"
"if i don't get some strawberry cake from somewhere soon, i'm gonna act a fool!!! anybody wanna make me one?"
"lord knows i dread to wash this hair of mines, but i gotta do it"
"be careful what you take for granted, someone else is waiting to appreciate it     "
freaking hate c-spire wireless!!!!! about to switch over

"i don't know about these other females but i don't wanna be somebody's baby mama, wifey, main chick, side chick    i better be the only chick    and i'd rather be \the wife\"" or \""mrs \"""""
never take relationship advice from single friends    just keep them out of your business altogether
about to go to this clubhouse and pop it 4 pimp (workout) lol
yaay!!! cold weather means hair like feathers! back to the roller wrap i go!
"beautiful, smart, and confident   hard to come by   catch me while you can   just saying"
it's raining men? well i think i'm e playful eriencing a drought   
mind and heart in the same place   but trying to separate them   
usm homecoming today  smttt!!!!!! #proudstudent
"not happy where i'm at, but its where i wanna be    "
holding on until i find something better
"i don't really wanna stay, i don't really wanna go, but i really need to know   can we get it together?    "

"i'm so tired of school, i'm just ready to get it over with and start working"
"i would just like to take the time out to wish the most important man in my life (next to god) a happy birthday      to my daddy, <propmale> henderson!!!! love you!"
i'm getting my hair done tomorrow and i'm so happy lalalalalaaaa!!!!! and now i'm singing  smile 
"funny how i always try to help ppl but they can never do anything for me, not even the simplest things, so i'm about to stop, about to be one selfish female"
guess i'll study and work on my paper this weekend    the joy of school
"so used to getting what i want, i don't know how to react when i'm told no #pissed"
woke up feeling great! thank god! and i'm giving nobody the power to mess up my day  smile 
being a little less of tejerria and a little more of tj   and i love it
"it'd be a blessing if someone cooked sunday dinner and invited me over, so i won't have to leave home on an empty stomach"
haunted house tonight with friends! but studying first   
"scared money don't make no money, if i ever go broke i'ma take yo' money  i'ma boss! lol"
"wanna say a very special happy birthday to my best burg friend, <propfemale> topp!!!! you're 21!!!! can't wait for the celebration saturday!"
in a really good mood  smile 
people who get in relationships and act like they're married are setting themselves up for failure
"two days really happy, back to back! thanks to one particular person, bet he sees this too  smile "
"just found $5 in my pocket, day starting off good already!"
"no one has relationships anymore, just relations"
"i hate for this weekend to end, had so much fun!"
"did my absentee vote friday and voted \no\"" on initiative 26  if you're smart you'll do the same tomorrow!"""

"seriously thinking about going to grad school at ole miss or jsu, but crossing fingers for ole miss"
"treating ppl how they treat me  if you don't give a *u*k, i don't give a flying, ducking, swimming, tossing nor swerving *u*k"
