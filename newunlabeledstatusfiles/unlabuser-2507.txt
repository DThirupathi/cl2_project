"inception was deceptively stupendous! even <propfemale> understood the whole movie! go figuire? it's most definitely worth watching, wouldn't mind even saying \ i should\"" watch it in 3d imax with some friends """
feeling really pissed-off! not so much discouraged but offended and not in anyway wanting to compromise with those who are big headed and very ignorant 
i wish i could choke the sh!t out of peoples heads and watch the crap leak out of their nose till there is nothing left but room to shove some humbleness and humility to shame them in front of others 
"true human nature is always a mystery and complex to understand   you can only produce so much <propfemale> till there is nothing left but the poor bastard who talks about what's wrong   rather than complain, be the smart bastard who corrects "
i wish i had a flaming sword to strike down vengeance and justice upon those who would dare corrupt and poison innocence   this world has too many selfish people who take others for granted and are unwilling to realize how lucky they are to be alive 
"i feel for those who want to make a difference in the world   envy those who would be heroes, i say pity those who need them   self proclaimed heroes are glorified to the point of vanity, feeding off of attention and praise from others "
"if there is anything i learned while working in the military, it's do the right thing even when no one is looking  would you be satisfied when someone praises you? rather than e playful ect emotional or physical reward, try and give the world a reason to live for you "
"i despise ignorance, i find it distasteful   be aware of my presence, i share no promises or rewards   i will provide the truth and i do not e playful ect those around me to swallow it "
i pray that those reading this take the initiative to make a difference in someone else's life   they could be a direct correlation to your happiness or a venomous downfall of your life 
"don't continue to be the blind fools of maniacal trends, allow yourself to admit to personal flaws   everyone's so concerned with what's wrong with themselves, you are only as perfect as what you are now  a precious life!"
