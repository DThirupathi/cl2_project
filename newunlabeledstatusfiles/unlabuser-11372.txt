"we all have people in our lives, some good some bad   either way they help shape us"
"life is what we make it and a <propmale> is like a picture, itâ€™d be nice if you just take it "
you can't let praise or criticism get to you  it's a weakness to get caught up in either one

"somehow everything seems clear now i think i found myself somehow  but i don't wanna close my eyes cus i'm scared of what i might become, so i try to take one step at a time, to help me ease my mind"
when one is ruled by fear they strive to prevent the very changes that will abate it
taking a step back in order to move forward

don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence
your coatesville is comin out put it away <propfemale> ruggiero quote of the night haha
the strength of the pack is each wolf  the strength of each wolf is the pack  leave your ego at the door is about family  love 
"i look at everything as a lesson because i don't want to walk around angry, or maybe it's because i finally understand  there are things we don't want to happen, but have to accept  things we don't want to know, but have to learn  and people we can't live without, but have to let go "
"we walkin the same path but got on different shoes, live in the same building but got different views"
wont play number two anymore
its not  whether you win or lose but about how long you keep playing the game and where it takes you 
a journey of a thousand <propmale> begins with a single step
