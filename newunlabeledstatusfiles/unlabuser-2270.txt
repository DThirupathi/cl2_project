ok its snowed im over it       it can go away now
i love how god provides  when ur in need the most help he always sends what u need when u least e playful ect it

so it's official i strongly very strongly dislike sponge <propmale> now that bryland has been home most the week
i am sick of watching people using others for their own personal gain  you know who you are and you need to stop saying outlandish things about people who were good to you  all i can say is you better stop and get you head out your rear because it is going to all boil over with people in the family you really don't want it to
