"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear  while you humiliate, offend & insult her, there's a man flirting with her & reminding her how beautiful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away    while you make your woman cry, there's a man stealing her smiles  post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence "
"promise to my kids: i will stalk you, freak out on you, lecture you, drive you crazy, be your worst nightmare, embarass you in front of your friends, hunt you down like a bloodhound because i love you!!!!!! when you understand that, i will know you are a responsible adult  you will never find someone who loves, cares, and worries about you more than your mom!!!!!! repost this if you are a mom!!!"
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, being a bitch, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they left off, even if they have been months apart  they love you for who you are  re-post if you have at least one true friend  they will know who they are "
