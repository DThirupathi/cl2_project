"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear    while you humiliate,offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make yourwoman cry there's a man stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence"

"we've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant  you can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself  you've got to keep watering it  you've got to really look after it and nurture it  ----- the great <propfirst> lennon"
"be impeccable with your word - what we say does make a difference our live\don't take anything personally - fuck what anyone says you are the director, producer, actor actress of your one time in this body\don't make assumptions - gotta stop!! we always put things in our heads and word in others mouths \ always do your best- put your all into everything you do"

its not about losing a few pounds and looking good its about feeling good and finding the passion in your life again
"i'm not a big sports fan at all but there is a hockey player from the chicago wolves as a patient at my job, im thinking about walking in the room and playing nurse with his fine ass!! lol jk i love you joshy"

enjoying my sunday with my silly little man
"â€œwhat you need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened, it has all worked together to bring you to this very moment  and this is the moment you can choose to make everything new right now â€�"
blah blah blah           annoyed 
everything happenes for a reason

"i've carried a child within my body  slept with my baby on my chest  i've kissed many boo boo's and mended broken hearts  i've been puked on, peed on, and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair  but i wouldn't have it any other way  my body isn't magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see a mom, and there is no greater honor  post this to your status if you are proud to be a mom ?"
so freaking cold my nose hairs were sticking together to walk from my house to my car!!! lol
life is            great!!  laugh 
the longer i live the more i realize the impact of attitude on life   we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will have for the day  we can't change our past and we can't change the fact that people will act in a certain way   i am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how i react to it  we are in charge of our attitudes 
mmmmmmm orange how you look so pretty and taste sooo goooooood
the sun is up i'm so  happy i could scream

"oh i wish i was an <propfirst> mayer weiner\that is what i'd truly like to be\cause if i were an <propfirst> mayer weiner\everyone would be in love with me!!"

for what ever you don't want or like there is always someone out there that will  treat it better
"where there is anger, respond with love  where there is envy, respond with nurturing  where there is fear respond with kindness "
