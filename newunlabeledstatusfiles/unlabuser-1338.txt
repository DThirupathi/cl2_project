"met a new person today  pretty random, and awesome  saw <propfirst>  he's awesome too, and still ticklish! new guy's name is <propfirst>  he let me drink some of his monster  lol and i didn't get to hyper!!!"
"oh, and i actually will get to show <propmale> this year  yay!!!!"
my internet hates me   
"talkin to <propfirst>, cuz my other lame friends are shunning me lol"
"i'm wondering if it's even worth it anymore, the whole dating thing  just keep getting used by assholes  keep setting myself up to get hurt it seems   "
"bonfire today! the official guest list: <propfirst>, <propfemale>, west, nate, <propfirst>, <propmale>, and <propmale>  (<propfemale> me i i know mostly guys  lol plus only one girl rsvp'd   )"
today is gonna be an awesome day!
"today was a rough day, apparently not allowed to have a conversation "
can't wait till the day 
"great  my ex met my sister, and now he keeps asking me about her  just great, really  really really really great  i hate her, and he's asking me questions about her  how stupid can an ex get?"
<propfemale> falto con todo mi corazÃ³n 
just had to revisit a bad memory  long story 
i miss a certain someone    
i miss everyone! coming to toledo on the 10th 
"absolutely devasted  just found out that because of our phone <propmale>, we can't afford to go to toledo on the 10th    "
i miss having fun!!!!
"<propfirst>, you're not boring  you're fun you silly wierdo who parties nude "

"instead of the 21st, it's gonna be on the 4th  yay  19 more days "
"sittin here chillin, waiting for the brownies to cool  maybe i'll b able to start baking myself again soon   "
"life sucks, but we all gotta pick ourselves up, brush it off, and walk away as if nothing ever happened   <propfirst>, <propfirst>, <propfirst>, and <propfemale> are great friends    i'd do anything for them (except what you're thinking <propfemale> lol)"
let the one you love know how you feel before it's too late and they're gone  that's probably the best advice ever  why don't i listen to my own advice? it's not fair   
"the first two (or three) days in sept  <propmale>, you know what im saying i hope)"
"bored, and hyper and tired, maybe i should go to bed   "
"shocked, surprised, and in awe of all the moronic people i've met this year "
i miss about 50 different memories right now    
"missing the old, trying to embrace the new"
"989-386-3371 if you wanna call  just not past 9 pm  i can call out, but i can't recieve calls past 9 pm"

"looking forward to school  yes, i actually am  lol who'da thunk it? not only do i have my family kicking my ass about school, but i have my friends, and riky and now his mom lol  i love you guys!"
"so i feel like i wanna kick something  don't worry, i'm not mad, but my leg muscle's are twitching like crazy lol"

"should i feel bad that, as a girl myself, i find the behaviors of other girls so freaking confusing? why do they gotta spend two hours in the freaking bathroom?"
"wondering why on earth that when i don't want the day to go fast, it does anyway, but when i do want the day to go fast, it just drags on   "

"if things could be different, would you take the risk and try to change things, not knowing whether you're changing it for the better or changing it for the worst? or should you just always go with the flow, and let the current wash you through life??"
i hope everything will work out   smile

"snow day  not complaining  however, i was hoping to have some words with some of the people at school  two-faced backstabbing traitors that they are  seriously though what is the point of being nice to someone's face, if you're just gonna go around sayin shit like our kid is gonna kill himself at age 3 i'm done with pretending i don't notice all the bullshit  hell hath no fury like a woman scorned  better watch out"
"yeah my boyfriend's hot, but with his other qualities, that's just a bonus  he makes me happy  he takes care of me  he can make me laugh when i'm feeling down  he's an awesome musician  he's actually got plans for his life  he's always willing to help others  to anyone who says he's a bad person, you obviously don't know him  all you people who talk shit about me and him: jealous deal with it"
