still in training and orientation classes  have to do fire training on friday and actually have to put out a fire!!!!
when a plane crashes we don't ban flying; when a bridge collapes we don't stop building them; when someone shoots another person we don't ban guns  so why should we stop drilling for oil when one accident takes place? let's learn from the mistakes and move on   repost if you support
finish up my classroom training and get released to my unit tomorrow!!! so excited to get out there and get on it    lol
it's starting to become very clear to me that some people will never change and that some things will never be the way i want them no matter how hard i try  sometimes it's just best to let it go even when part of you doesn't want to 
start work on my unit tomorrow  excited to meet my co-workers!!!!
"thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone for the hapy bday wishes!!!!"

both of the kids are sick as a dog  now they can't go to daycare and i can't get done the things i needed to  and i am so grossed out because my kids keep using my leg as a kleenex 
"i am so mad this morning  sooooomebody was looking at porn on my computer and now i have viruses and a worm on my computer   it is all messed up, moving slow as heck, and won't let me get into certain programs  and this pervert knows who he is "
"got kavon pre-registered for pre-k at mainland preparatory school  1 more year and my little genius will be in school  he is so excited to get to ride the school bus, but they don't have a bus for that school  poor baby "
i am hoping something good comes really soon

it's hump day!!!! yay!!!!!!
tgif!!!!!!!!!!!!! it's been a busy week so hopefully i can relax a little bit this weekend 
what an eye opener i had this weekend  i think god sometimes makes it so apparent what his plan is for you 
sometimes you just have to throw in the towel when you realize the other person is never going to change  if they can't respect me then i don't need them 
can't have a family with someone who doesn't want their family  its just me and my kids and i am ok with it now  taking the kids to the park to play since the weather is so nice 
"have to go clothes shopping for the kids since their father took every piece of clothing that he bought  what kinda person takes back things from the kids just because we aren't together anymore? o'well, they are running around happy as can be and haven't even asked where their dad is once  just taking this change day by day "
"thought i was going to have a kid free weekend and get some errands done, but it doesn't look like it now  o'well, can't complain when it comes to spending time with the babies!!!!!! just ready for friday!!!!"
going for drinks tonight with my girls!!!!!!!!!
at the bingo hall with my mom and my niece  damn this place makes me feel like an old lady 
less than 3 weeks until i move into my own place!!!!
it's humpday!!!!!!!! can't wait to take the babies trick or treating!!!!!!
at the emergency room with my baby daddy  hope he gets to feeling better soon 
its monday and back to work  grrrrr
"my poor babygirl has to have surgery <propmale> her eye on monday  no parent ever wants their child to have to have surgery  and i can't even be there for the surgery cuz of work, that's the hardest part for me "
laney's surgery went well!!!! she is home sleeping and groggy from the anesthesia  can't wait to get home to see my babygirl!!!!
headed to the nutcracker market with my moms!!!
is so suprised how somebody will act when it comes to money 
tomorrow is moving day!!!! excited to get me and the kids settled into our new place!!!
what is up with all of this complaining about body scans @ the airport? if you dont like the security measures taken at the airport for your security then freaking drive  i bet these ppl would'nt be bitching about body scans when a terrorist with a bomb ends up on their plane 
what is up with this weather? walked outside and it felt like it's 100% humidity 
excited to go camping this weekend with the family!!!!!! going to enjoy the cold weather by the campfire 
so glad he chose me! i think i need to b pinched again!
"ok, so <propfirst> got on my fb and posted a buunch of songs and comments  i apologize to anyone who got a message from me today  it wasn't me who sent it "
enjoying this cold weather!!!!
"this morning kavon tells me, \i'm gonna teach you how to say <propfemale> mommy  first you say \""dor\"" then you say \""a\""  yeah thats how you say it  good job mommy \"" cracked me up!!!!!! my babies are a blessing and me me smile everyday!!!!!!!!!"""
arrogance and rudeness are training wheels on the bicycle of lifeâ€¦for weak people who cannot keep their balance without them 
a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty!
at the rockets game with my baby and mya!!!!!
tgif!!!!!!!!!!! my baby girl is suck though   hopefully she will be better soon 
now both the kids woke up with 103 fever  i swear my kids are always sick  really really praying they r better by xmas!!!!
"the greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it "
"i think relationships r like glass, sometimes its best to leave it broken than to hurt yourself putting it back together "
"now my kids father says he won't b there in the morning to watch his kids open their gifts  my step daughter is going to be there also, but he won't  my daughter didn't get her breathing treatments at all while she was with her father cuz i guess it was just too much of a hassle for him  i am not suprised at any of this from him either  sad sad sad "
<propfemale> christmas facebook!!!!!!!
god <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change; courage to change the things i can; and wisdom to know the difference 
the weekend went fast and now its time to go back to work  kavon is going to the zoo for the first time tomorrow with his aunt <propfirst>!!!! i know he is going to really have fun 
it was just proved to me once a liar always a liar  and i'm writing them liars out of my life 
"sitting at home with kavon, <propfirst>, d'laney and <propfemale>  man do i have my hands full  total birth control for me!!!!!"
"omg it was a crazy but funny morning  kavon decided this morning he wanted to pee in the big toilet standing up like daddy  he was peeing all over the floor and back of the toilet  never again i say, never again  from now on daddy can tackle the peeing standing up "
joy is the best make-up!!!!!!
"it's monday and time to get back to work  have a busy busy week so i am sure i will be ready for a <propfemale> by friday!!! probably 2 or 3 <propfemale>s, lol!!!"
not looking forward to tomorrow
things are looking really good now!!!
brrrrrrr!!!!! i wish i was home in bed under my comforter snuggled up with my baby  he is my personal heater!!!!!
"we are e playful ecting again! i know, i know, it's crazy isn't it? i can't believe it myself  i wasn't going to put it on here yet, but decided to make it official  i mean who would have guessed that we are e playful ecting again!! yup it's official   we are e playful ecting freezing temps today and again friday!! hahahaha gotcha!!!!!!**re-post if you have any sense of humor"
everytime my kids dad gets mad at me he doesn't come and pick them up to see them  i don't know how he doesn't realize he is hurting them  as a mom u never want to see ur kids hurting 
it really sucks when u realize the one person who claims to love u and to have ur back is actually the person who intentionally hurts u the most its really time for some self evaluation and to focus on myself and my kids its time for me to start setting an example for my kids by showing them u don't need mean and hurtful ppl in ur life
