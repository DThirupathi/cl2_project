i am just an ignorant little stone living in my own little world 
gonna go out bmxing for a little while  might be able to get a video of myself for you guys  surprise 
it's too f@#$ing hot outside to do much of anything! d: i still got a decent bmx session in  my lungs burn a little and my arms are sore haha 
"just relaxing and listening to music  just downloaded some slightly old school people i used to listen to back in middle school: pod, finger eleven, trapt, simple plan, rotersand "
for fuck's sake    i love how today just ended    not   
let  him  go!
had a good time despite today's epic failures   smile  i'm worn out  my arms are sore like hell 
there comes a time in every man's life    when he needs to knock that stupid bitch out! > sad 
woo    interesting day today    too many complications  i kinda miss my simple life 
fortunate cookie: friendship is an ocean that you cannot see the bottom (in bed) 
"today's horoscope\money: 4 5\energy: 4 5\love: 5 5\mood: 4 5\daily compatibility: aquarius\\i fucking win  smile   love  <propfemale>"
today can kiss my ass   
good bye sanity    knew you well   
is normal for a man to cry over what he really feels after telling his love the opposite?
is it worth it? yes   
a lady working for some life insurance company came over today and performed a quick analysis and physical on me  she even <propfirst> some blood    i hate needles    i felt really sick right after  i passed out for about 2 hours  annoyed \
got nothing to do today  anyone play guild wars?
so stupid   
"love\love is not seen like you see beautiful sunsets\love has no odor like you smell delightful flowers\love cannot be tasted like you taste ice cream\love does not make sound like you hear music\love must be felt,\but love is not a physical sensation\love must be given\love must be received\love must be willing,\'n love must be true\nothing's better than saying \i love you\""\",39bc341bfaee8911ed7bbb7e84af0e0e,arrghh!!
i     fucking hate today    
guys will go on about their supposed feelings for someone when their ulterior motive is to get into their pants 
"guys will say \i'll be here for you always\"" and then disappear the very next day """
you are only ever truly alone when no one cares about you 
the world could be ending and i will still sleep like a rock  what is wrong with me?
i really can't believe it   
apparently i'm too smart for my own brain and i'm eventually going to go insane  not too far from the truth whatsoever  smile 
another day for me to hate   
fucking bullshit   
so unhappy right now    *sigh*
stupid day   
so the new linkin park album sucks (except for a couple songs) just like the last   
"still waiting, but i should probably give up  sad "
i would post a new picture of myself but someone wanted it to themselves ;o
guess what? more bullshit    no surprise there   
"going to work, bmxing, and seeing <propfemale> are pretty much the only 3 things i have been doing since school ended  i have no life  v v planning on going for the written exam to get my license one of the saturdays this month though "
i'm listening to asking <propfemale>'s album stand up and scream  they remind me of blessthefall a bit  they sound pretty good in my opinion if you're into the whole varied voice thing like harsh voice and screamo and clean vocals sort of thing 
i got the new droid x phone  laugh 
more bullshit    happens everytime    getting seriously sick and tired of it 
my mind is a wreck without you   
i love reese's peanut butter cups
"mom: it's gonna suck when you have to give away your reese's on holloween \me:    f@#$ that!"
"go away, mom    >_> now   "

 sad 
lkefjl;hksegknwhopughoiehrg
tears can't even e playful ress the fucking hatred and sorrow i feel right now 
i feel so    cold   
"i kept reading that conversation over and over again, so i deleted it  all it did was bring back those feelings  now if only there was a way to stop thinking about it    maybe    there is one thing but i might regret it   "
nevermind  got something for now
got my license    yay   
people think i'm 20 years old x x;
too angry to sleep    - -
frustrated

"wow    people are fucking retarded at 2 in the morning    a car jumped the curb in front of my house, barely missed my brother's parkes car, and skid into our fence  cops, ambulance, fire truck, and a news <propfirst> even drove by    ambulance and fire truck are gone now though  no one is hurt  > > guy is probably drunk   "

"r i p  <propfemale>  heart-broken   crying  could have used a certain someone right about now    june 2009-january 2010 (no, my cat did not kill her)"
