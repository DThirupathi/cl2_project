"quote for the day: \live with integrity  laugh with your whole heart  love without reservation or regret  pray with passion and purpose  praise like this is your last <propmale> to thank god for all he's done for you and worship without thoughts of how other's view your radical surrender \"" -cc  good morning holy spirit"""
"whatever you are going through, go through it hand in hand with the lord  -cc"
when god gives a word it goes straight to the heart and takes root  let us mix that word with faith that it would <propfemale> and bring forth fruit  thank you jesus!

ummm    i just had a good dinner    meatless go figure  i wasn't e playful ecting it to be as tasty as it was 
"the greatest miracles god ever performed where in the desert  so if you feel like your smack dab in the middle of a dry and thirsty place, don't despair  speak to the rock and he will pour forth the refreshing river of water you need  he is our source, our ever present help  trust him to see you through the desert into your <propfemale>  god bless  night "
"not feeling well, but i am healed in jesus name!"
jesus is a healer and a comforter! just giving him praise for he is worthy!

"i'm trying to decide, and need your help    should i   1  pony up and go for a walk at the park (but it's hot out there), or 2  get something to eat, go to bed early and get some sleep (i am pretty tired)? i haven't been sleeping well, either way, pray for me!!!"
i decided to eat and talk on the phone to a friend  i'm still tired so pray for me  lol! the joy of the lord is my strength!
brokenness is absolutely neccessary in the life of a believer  there can be no growth without it  those who refuse to voluntarily throw themselves upon the solid rock (jesus) and allow themselves to be broken shall find themselves ground to dust in the day of his return  he is a lamb first but then comes the lion! do not be one who is turned away!
"man, i really need to stop going to bed late and getting up early! here's a question for you    does god love an early bird or a late owl when we are seeking his presence in prayer  i've heard the great e playful eriences with him when i sacrificed to get up early    what about yhou?"
"i am called, appointed, anointed, blessed and highly favored of the lord  there's a word in my mouth that is life to those with ears to hear  there is nothing the devil can do to me that god can't turn around for my good!"
i am eating left over choclate chip pancakes and hash browns    mmmm    yummm  god is good!
okay    i'm going to bed early    got to work tomorrow!
"when you're wondering what god has for you, stop, and first consider    what do you have for him? this is an exchange? will we only give him our sorrows and griefs? that god we can and he takes them willingly    but when do we move beyond him cleaning up our messes? when do we seek not to merely stop displeasing the lord and focus instead on pleasing him (making him happy)  ask yourself, where is your heart?"
wow    it's amazing how much you miss the internet when it's down!
"if you are feeling bound    whether it's by fear, doubt, shame, anger, jelousy, waeriness, confusion, depression, rejection, or addiction to things you just can't seem to let go of    know that jesus is the answer! where the presence of the lord is there is freedom!!!"
just watched letters to god    sniff sniff sappy    sentamental    a god cry    i loved it!
contemplating what it means to worhip god in spirit and in truth! hmmm    i guess if you are you know you are and if you don't know you are you aren't! a sticky proposition! it kind of reminds me of when my mom used to tell us kids    you better get yo' spirit right! hah! i always wondered    how do i do that? i guess sometimes i still wonder! lol
church was good! god is good! and this food is smelling real good! lol!
what do you do when you are believing god for something and it doesn't come through? did god let you down? no he has something far better for you!
god is a giver of good things  he loves us  he cares when we are tired or sad or fearful he answers us when we have questions  he hears are innermost desires  h blesses us with joy and peace and courage and strength  he is amazing  i am amazed he loves me  thank you jesus!
"jesus saves  jesus! not cc! not the government    not a doctor, lawyer, a great musician  not our moms or dads, not our husbands or wives  not our money or  intelligence  jesus! he is our light, our salvation, our strong tower    he alone is the gate, the only way to the father! jesus saves    nothing (and no one) else!"

"unless the lord builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted  unless the lord protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good  ps 127:1 nlt"

a life lived for for jesus is never wasted; a life lived for ourselves produces no gain!
"faith isn't blind, it is our sight set on jesus, knowing his heart is set on love "

"when you change your focus so that it is no longer set on self or the world or others but center it wholly on pleasing the one who has loved you so well and paid such a high price for your joy and peace    then you will find you not only cease to struggle in giving up you sins, your plans, even things you like love desire need, but you will rush to offer them up with great joy and anticipation of his rejoicing "
"i pray that god <propmale> you the deepest of your secret desires, ones you aren't even sure are possible for you  that he show you how deeply & truly you are loved  he delights in your joy, and takes great pleasure in your faith in him  he will go out of his way to shelter & protect you  you have no idea just what he has saved you from    continued in comment   "
