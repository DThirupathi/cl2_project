this is not my day   
i just stumbled onto a <propfemale> with tips on boiling water  seriously? it even linked to a video on   how to boil water  because i never knew that you had to leave room in the pot for what you wanted to cook!
"caelynn slept all night and had to a be dragged out of bed at 11    she's now napping and has been for an hour  all i can say is: wow  that, and, she's not sick, so don't worry  must be a growth spurt  playful "

"<propfirst> and i went out on our first real date tonight! dinner and a movie - where the wild things are  we also grabbed some books for the entire family to enjoy (where the wild things are, a dr  suess compilation, and <propfemale> skeleton)  doesn't get any better than that "
looove naptime with my baby girl - fell asleep rocking her  what i'm not loving is the fact that she was warm and cranky earlier  let's hope it was an oddity and she's not getting sick!
"there needs to be some type of universal law stating that either all medications are safe in pregnancy, or, pregnancy puts overly painful anythings into a temporary remission  i'd be happy with either of those, thank you   laugh "
"hate, hate, hate atuomatic form letter responses  i've had a company send over 8 different email from 5 different people, and only one person has bothered to read anything before replying  granted, their reply is in the form of another form letter, but this time it's at least relevant "
"had the sonogram today, it's officially a boy!  love "
"oh man, today was exhausting  i got caelynn into the doctor this morning with a high fever, and after traumatizing her for almost 4 hours with various medical tests, we've determined it's a virus of some type (not the flu)  afterward, i had my own appointment and found that i have a legitimate reason to be tired 24 hours a day and feeling eww - fibromyalgia  it's not just all in my head!"

feeling pretty craptastic today 
two sleeping babies! mmmm    time to myself 
<propmale> woke at some ungodly hour before the sun came up and it took my non-morning-person ass forever to calm him down  so guess what?! caelynn woke what feels like five minutes later just as i'm drifting back to sleep  they're in cahoots 
"ah, the joys of motherhood  i can watch all the cartoons i want and blame my daughter   love "
"well, tonight royally sucked  yay "
kids won't sleep  i have a migraine and no cigs  this does not bode well 
"two hours of sleep, yay! dreaming of the days i can sleep in at least twice a week again  stay at home moms need weekends, too!"
"it's amazing what a good night's sleep can do  granted, that was alcohol induced, but i finally have an rx for ambien and plan on getting plenty of sleep during <propfirst>'s upcoming 3 days off "
"<propfirst> cut his finger badly enough that we debated on whether or not to take him in for stitches  went from sleep to wide awake in a few seconds- most uncharacteristic for me, but good to know i can do it if need be "
"caelynn found a ladybug in the yard today and had to pick it up to play with it  she squealed with delight when it crawled up her arm, then proceeded to hug and kiss it through her paci  she sat down to play with it a few times after showing us her treasure and about 5 minutes later took a <propfemale> finger and squished it  she then carefully stepped on it's remains and i decided it was time to go in "
caelynn's first word with two different syllables: <propfemale>! we got up early enough that the neighbor's outdoors cats hadn't been brought in and she got to play with them  she shocked us by calling for them instead of her usual barking  yes   she grew up with dogs 
"finally found something to help me sleep, let's hope i don't get used to ambien like i do with everything else  not that i'd take it every night, but still    sweet dreams"
<propfirst>'s favourite part of his days off: being able to get caelynn when she wakes so they can spend the morning together goofing off  best daddy ever 
just got a message from my voc rehab case worker - i qualify! planning on going to devry for my bachelor's in web design management when the next term starts!
"little did we know, caelynn knows exactly what shampoo is and can unscrew the cap  \she took a sample bottle of shampoo i had just gotten in the mail and while i was making lunch decided to wash her hair  i found her on the floor in the living room rubbing the frothy gelled soap into her dry hair and giggling with pride  i didn't think it was ever going to rinse out "
"i love a good thunderstorm! on the downside, it looks like we won't be going to the outdoor led zeppelin eagles tribute concert tonight  at least the tickets were free!"
"getting excited about our trip to florida to visit family in october  we'll be in cape <propfemale> for a week visiting <propfirst>'s side of the family, and then the kids and i are going up to pinellas to visit mine for 3!  love "
"florida may be the lightening capitol of the world, but i don't remember any storms coming close to this one here in kansas tonight  it's just flash after flash after flash  aside from the power surges and losses, i'm loving it!"
"woke up dizzy and unstable this morning - so bad that i had to make sure i took the right meds last night  this is crazy weird   i feel drugged  my head's floating bobbing and things look extra 3d, if that makes sense   surprise "
only kansas would have two seperate offices for auto registration and drivers licences and keep them on the opposite ends of town   
"i'll always love you, <propfirst>  rest in peace  love "
"ready to get back into the groove of every day life  i still have to unpack what feels like a million bags from our trip to florida, but i'd much rather shop painful pleasures for new jewelry  i can't decide on what i want to wear in my nose    decisions, decisions "
feeling pretty brain-dead today  -_-
"<propfirst> surprised me this week with the plans of an official wedding ceremony in florida next march on or near our anniversary! he first asked our families to make sure we could hold it in my parents' back yard and that our kansas relatives could come  so sweet, and now i get to plan!"
daydreaming and planning the wedding  trying to keep that balance between normal wedding and my own personal taste  it's harder than you'd think!
"if anyone has any old extra mechanical clocks, watches, and the like, lemme know! i'm looking for gears and other metal findings for jewelry and costumes "
"had a wonderful day today! spent time with the family, had a great meal, let caelynn play in her pool (and later the rain), and sat in <propfemale>'s backyard and watched some fireworks <propfirst> grabbed from missouri  happy 4th, everyone   love "
"ugh, feelin like death today  and what's up with kids never being able to sleep at the same time? i couldn't sleep until after 2, and then <propmale> was up during all the wee hours in the morning  when i finally got him to fall asleep and was just dozing off, myself, i hear caelynn waking up  i could have cried "
"\sitting in green room with <propfirst> bieber    must resist urge to roundhouse kick him in his midget face\"" -tweeted by will ferrell  just one more reason to love him """

"caelynn's spending her first night at home in her new <propfemale> toddler bed  i was worried about her constantly getting up and running around, but she's doing great so far"
"it's way too early to be awake, especially considering the fact that i went to bed 4 hours ago  -_-"
"if my phone weren't dead, this update would include a picture of caelynn napping in her bed with her mouth wide open  i really am amazed at her transition  she isn't even using the blankie that she drags around everywhere - she's covered in her new set "
really wish my daughter would sleep in every now and then  how did two people who prefer to go to bed at 5am get someone who likes to *wake up* at 5?   -_-    zzzzz
