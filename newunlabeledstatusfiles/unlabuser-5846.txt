"firefighters, emt's, paramedics, & law enforcement officers of all kinds work the streets day & night to keep people safe they are missing their family to care for yours  in 2010, there were 85 firefighters, 39 ems and 160 police officers killed in the line of duty  re-post this if you are a firefighter, emt, paramedic, or law enforcement officer, loved one, or appreciate one, or just take a moment to thank them "
"doesn't make much sense, does it??: homeless go without eating  elderly go without needed medicines  mentally ill go without treatment  troops go without proper equipment  veterans go without benefits that were promised  yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first  1% will re-post and 99% won't  have the guts to re-post this  i know i'm in the 1%"
