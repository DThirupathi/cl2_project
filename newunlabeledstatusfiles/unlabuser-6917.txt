a politician sees his family everyday; a deployed soldier once in 1 year a politician flies 1st class; a soldier flies in a c130  a politician's pension is not reduced; a soldier's is clawed 65%  a politician enjoys an e playful ense account; a soldier must justify extra rations  a politician vows to defend their country; a soldier actually    keeps that promise

so  my brother is a liar    why i have my suspicions but those are unrelated  he has no logical reason for me to actually believe in his lie and the timeframe on which the lie is based upon is so skewed there's no way i could even begin to believe it 
so my brother @<propfirst> <propfirst> smith whines about me calling him out on some lie  then he removes me from facebook  way to go tough guy 
well i'm about to go on a run 
"argh  feet sore as shit  cant run today, need new shoes now   "

back from dep  pt was cool  i actually managed to keep up even with pushups (for the most part) 
alright  what the fuck is with people magically turning into a pokemon?
alright i understand this pokemon thing (thank you <propfemale>)  i just want to say to anyone who is going to pick a pokemon if you choose a legendary you have no creativity!
alright  i'll bite  only because i'm repping the original 150 though  i give you #059!
"i decided to try and sit through the a thousand suns album and found out that the album isnt that bad if you can actually understand the theme  the wisdom justice, and love intro into iridescent does that song some good despite how much i dont like it  it's decent "
i've been putting a shitload of comics on my ipod  something for me to read  listen to me    i'll be sure to stop this shit before i ship out  til then x-men here i come lol 
i just woke upâ€¦ wow today's gonna be one lazy ass day for me 
well if i decide seals is not for me for whatever reason then swcc is 
well the cartoon character thing is true so yea 
i guess i'm crashing at maki's
ugh i fell asleep  now i'm starving  i'm going to destroy the fridge in a conquest for food 
what the hell is this number thing?
alright  before i ship off i'm gonna have a private lock-in at zap zone  it's gonna be the 23rd  inbox me to let me know your going  i'll let you know how much it is  the more people the less it'll cost 
i guess i'll get some sleep    finally got the iron man 2 dvd 4 fucking gigs  i'll watch it in the morn when i wake up 
"got a \surprise\"" meeting with my recruiter  no clue what it's for but i gotta be there at 8 smile 0 tomorrow  i'm not too enthused to be waking up that early """
i checked how much a private lock-in would cost  it's $30 per person 
alright  i'm gonna be nice and do it this one time 
22  your a friend who has no problem having fun  it really doesnt matter who's there  you have a way with keeping those around you happy (in my eyes)  you'll be one of those people i can trust when i leave and when i come back 
007  i'm not too surprised you'd chose this number  in reality i dont <propfemale> with you much but i know why now (grounded)  your a cool guy who says what he wants  i have witnessed this  your really dont seem to give a flying fuck what they say 
421  your really one of the first friends i really had  i consider you a brother and you know that  we need to <propfemale>  i better see you the 23rd when i have that lock-in 
6060  your family  that should be enough but noooo  i really did not want to move out of new york but i'm sure you know that  it's been a long time since weve seen each other but i'll be sure to visit when i get some leave from the navy 
see how easily i got sucked up into this 
99  the last time i remember seeing you waas at the military ball  perhaps a few more times in school  you were always outspoken  i'd like to actually <propfemale> out sometime before i leave 
66  i've seen you around kennedy from time to time but never really met you  you seem really cool and you and <propfemale> are practically sisters  it wouldve been cool to get to know you better 
sleep   
30 day notice  i leave in 30 days  where did the time go?
gonna go up to the school tomorrow and visit some teachers 
sometimes i wonder how the hell i can just stay on facebook for hours 
i'll be up til 4 am so much for visiting kennedy 
so much for visiting the school  having to stay up til 5 surprise 0 isnt to great when you have to wake up 30 minutes later  fuck that 
i think it'd be in my best interest to get some sleep 
bored may go lay down 
never again!!!
i need to start waking up earlier than this 
music is my vice  i now realize i have to go to basic without it    great 
need to start waking up earlier than 1 smile 0   
finding something to do besides raid a fridge is becoming a menacing task all in it's own 
"6 days til the lock-in \10 days til i'm finally 18\17 days til i'm gone \\how exciting"
i now realize that when i type or im i do everything in my power to make it as grammatically correct (punctuations included) as possible or else i wont post it  if i don't i just reword it 
nothing going on today  it's one of those relaxing days i guess 
did a count on how many people are in for the lock-in  23  not including people who are bringing others like <propfirst>  need about 7 more 
oh how i love to be underestimated 
sometimes i wonder what the hell there is for me to do at 3 smile 0 am on facebook   
lol well after march when i ship it wont be all boring  apparently some friends want to go to florida for a bit 
   sleep     
just woke up  yay
fml lock-in is scrapped 
i should probably get some sleeps 
today's gonna be on of those stay at home days 
being home all day sucks  did i mention that?

"well  i'm up  no thanks to my brother who screams \get the hell up\""  guess i'll listen to music  revenge of the nerds mixtape here i come """
