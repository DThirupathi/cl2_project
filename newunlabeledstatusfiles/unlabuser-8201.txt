some people are soooo mean you try to be there for them as much as you can but they some how manage to throw you like you didnt even mean a thing to them
if we learn to forgive people then life feels like that much more and we can start to walk again
hopefully we will take some photos today for photography and then everyone can see the world as i do which could be good or bad i guess we will find out
wish i could stop thinking about someone                     man it hurts
