"if i touch a burning candle i can feel no pain  if you cut me with a knife it's still the same  and i know her heart is beating and i know that i am dead  yet the pain here that i feel, try and tell me it's not real  for it seems that i still have a tear to shed"
sinking in the weight of all we need to say why's and what if's have since long played out left us short on happy endings    it's now or never
i sense there's something in the wind  that feels like tragedy's at hand  and though i'd like to stand by him  can't shake this feeling that i have  the worst is just around the bend 
it's hard to say that i'd rather stay awake when i'm asleep because my dreams are bursting at the seams
"i met god's will on a halloween night, he was dressed as a bag of leaves "
i love rain 
is very bored

"god gave us two ears to hear, two eyes to see and two hands to hold  but why did god give us only one heart? because he gave it to someone else and he wants us to find it "
"i wonâ€™t suffer, be broken  get tired, or wasted  surrender to nothing  i'll give up what i started and stop this from end to beginning  a new day is coming and i am finally free"
"don't take it personally cause we were never in love  it doesn't really matter, who you say you are - sing it out the window of your car, find another girl across the bar    cause l-o-v-e is not what this was!"
and no message could have been any clearer  if you wanna make the world a better place take a look at yourself and then make a change  i'm starting with the man in the mirror!
hmm it went well i think  guess i'll find out for sure whether it truly did or not by the end of today  oh i hope it went the way i felt it did!
haha i'm pretty sure i have thee world's most adorable niece and nephews 
really dislikes fake and superficial people  and it really sucks to find so many in your lifetime  life is too short to have to deal with it all  just cut the bs and be real 
no more lives torn apart that wars would never start and time would heal all hearts  every man would have a friend that right would always win and love would never end    my grown up christmas list
"take a breath, take it deep calm yourself, he says to me if you play, you play for keeps take a gun, and count to three iâ€™m sweating now, moving slow no time to think, my turn to go  and you can see my heart beating you can see it through my chest said iâ€™m terrified but iâ€™m not leaving  know that i must pass this test, so just pull the trigger"
the course of true love never did run smooth
"believe in what your heart is saying  hear the <propfemale> that's playing  there's no time to waste  there's so much to celebrate  believe in what you feel inside, and give your dreams the wings to fly  you have everything you need, if you just believe!"

"when i let go of what i am, i become what i might be "
"not what we say about our blessings, but how we use them, is the true measure of our thanksgiving "
let's do some gratuitous violence 
"alone in your mind, waiting for the sun to shine alone in your mind, waiting for the sign that its time  to break free from the words that hold you down  to escape from the feeling you are lost and cant be found dont hide your face, you cannot erase  the pain that stays in your eyes  lay down your guard, show them who you are  behind your disguise"
"just found out that my cousin triston has a tumor the size of a golf ball, at the base of his skull  even if you don't know of him i ask that you keep him in your prayers  he goes in for surgery thursday  i love you triston!"
going to have sushi with <propfemale> and then too see a movie! sounds like a pretty sweet plan to me!
i hate mondays 
"what is this illusion called the innocence of youth? maybe only in that blind belief can we ever find the truth  no more lives torn apart, that wars would never start  and time would heal our hearts, every man would have a friend  that right would always win, and love would never end    this is my grown up christmas list "
"the <propfemale> is a wonderful symbol of the christmas spirit  just remember, the true spirit of christmas lies within your heart "
"there's a place called home i can almost see, with a red front door, and a roaring fire, and a christmas tree  yes, a place called home full of love and family, and i'm there at the door watching you come home to me    in the dark of the night, let your heart come home to me"
"the hardest thing is loving someone and then having the courage to let them love you back  but if at the end of the day if you still would rather give up than try, nothing is ever going to be worth it   "
"oh why? thats what i keep asking was there anything i could have said or done? oh i had no clue you were masking a troubled soul  oh god only knows what went wrong and why you would leave the stage in the middle of a song   oh why there's no comprehending and who am i to try judge or e playful lain  but i do have one burning question  who told you life wasnt worth the fight? they were wrong, they lied"
"blood and tears, they were here first  ransom notes keep falling out your mouth  mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs  speak no feeling, no i don't believe you  you don't care a bit"
"when it seems that we have lost our way, we find ourselves again on christmas day! believe in what your heart is saying  hear the <propfemale> that's playing, there's no time to waste there's so much to celebrate! believe in what you feel inside and give your dreams the wings to fly! you have everything you need    if you just believe"
"i want your loving and i want your revenge you and me could write a bad romance  i want your loving all your love is revenge, you and me could write a bad romance     i want your love i donâ€™t wanna be friends j'veux ton amour et j'veux ton revenge j'veux ton amour i donâ€™t wanna be friends!"
i want your horror i want your design cause youâ€™re a criminal as long as your mine i want your love    love-love-love i want your love

"not what i e playful ected  it was incredibly beautiful, an enchanting nightmare  <propfemale> said it perfectly    it blew my mind! black swan 5 stars in my opinion"
i've got to get a move on with my life
"gambling? who said anything about gambling? it's not gambling when you know you're gonna win  counting cards is a foolproof system     it's also illegal    it's not illegal, it's frowned upon, like masturbating on an airplane    i'm pretty sure that's illegal too    yeah, maybe after 9 11, where everybody got so sensitive  thanks a lot, bin laden-"
"can i ask you another question? sure    you probably get this a lot  this isn't the real caesar's palace is it? what do you mean? did, umm    did caesar live here?no    i didn't think so "
"russian roulette is not the same without a gun, and baby when its not love if its not rough it isn't fun!"
"i thought i told you im a <propfemale> you see the ice? you see the cars? flashy lights everywhere we are, livin life like theres no tomorrow! i got money i dont need a range    imma pimp i dont need a cane!!!"
your feet will bring you to where your heart is 
"i fell for you, and i knew the vision of your loveliness i hoped and i prayed that someday, i'd be the vision of your happiness    my darling dear, love you all the time  i'm just a fool, a fool in love with you "
let your joy- scream across the pain
let your beauty unfold
"yeah, life is beautiful  our hearts, they beat and break  life is beautiful, but it's complicated, we barely make it  we don't need to understand, there are miracles, miracles  stand where you are  we let all these moments pass us by  it's amazing where i'm standing, there's a lot that we can give  this is ours just for a moment  there's a lot that we can give "
"nothing is permanent, not even death    imaginarium of doctor parnassus - amazing film  i'm not at all shocked that <propmale> ledger was nothing but brilliant! *sigh* incredible "
"i need, some new stile-ttos can't walk, down the street in those you are, who you wear it's true! a girl's just as hot as the shoes she choose j'adore weitzman, habillez-moi <propfirst>, dolce gabbana, <propfirst> mcqueen, eh ou  merde i love those manolo  fashion put it all on me don't you want to see these clothes on me fashion put it all on me i am anyone you want me to be"
after the hard rock i blacked out! it was like emptiness ha ha ha
"love is much like a wild <propfemale>, beautiful and calm, but willing to draw blood in its defense "
beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart
she lives in a <propfemale> tale somewhere too far for us to find forgotten the taste and smell of the world that she's left behind it's all about the e playful osure the lens i told her the angles were all wrong now she's ripping wings off of butterflies keep your feet on the ground when your head's in the clouds well go get your shovel and we'll dig a deep hole to bury the castle    ba da ba ba da ba ba ha!
is done 
"a beautiful and blinding morning  the world outside begins to breathe  see clouds arriving without warning    if i could make these moments endless, if i could stop the winds of change, if we just keep our eyes wide open  then everything would stay the same "
"really done with people who can say whatever they want behind your back  but never have the guts to say it to my face  if you are going to say something about me, have the decency to say it in front of me "
some people should listen to their own advice  those are my thoughts currently 
"life is short, don't waste time worrying about what people think of you  hold on to the ones that care, in the end they will be the only ones there "
happy birthday aunt <propfemale>  i love you and i miss you 
love is patient  love is kind  love is    slowly losing you're mind! haha happy <propfirst>'s day everyone!
"happiness needs sadness  success needs failure  benevolence needs evil  love needs hatred  victory needs defeat  pleasure needs pain  you must e playful erience and accept the extremes  because if the contrast is lost, you lose appreciation; and when you lose appreciation, you lose the value of everything "
we're all mad here! baha so excited!
"â€œlife is partly what we make it, and partly what it is made by the friends we choose â€� thanks to all the people who made it to <propmale>'s party you truly made it a great night!"
"close your eyes, so many days go by  easy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's right  i believe in you, i can show you that i can see right through all your empty lies  i won't stay long, in this world so wrong  say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight "
"\nothing can bring you peace but yourself \"""""
let the wild rumpus start!
"because thats what people do    they leap and hope to god they can fly! because otherwise, we just drop like a rock    wondering the whole way down   \why in the hell did i jump?\"""""
"talk to the mirror oh choke back tears  and keep telling yourself that im a diva! oh and the smokes in that cigarette box on the table, they just so happen to be laced with nitroglycerin  im the new cancer, never looked better, you cant stand it  because you say so under your breath  youre reading lips when did he get all confident? havent you heard that im the new cancer? never looked better, and you can't stand it!"

"the moment we stop fighting for each other, that's the moment we lose our humanity "
"aprÃ¨s moi <propfemale> deluge, after me comes the flood "
so excited for the st  <propfirst>'s day parade tomorrow mornin'!
"it rained on my parade today, but thats okay because i love the rain  pretty much made the day ten times better  except it started snowing  that was upsetting "
and so it begins 
"it's easy to be pleasant when life flows by like a song  but the man worth while is the one who can smile, when everything goes dead wrong  for the test of the heart is trouble and it always comes with years  and the smile that is worth the praises of earth, is the smile that shines through the tears "
"top o' the mornin to ya! may the road rise up and meet you  may the wind be at your back  may the sun shine warm upon your face  may the rain fall soft upon your fields  and until we meet again, may god hold you in the palm of his hand  happy st  <propfemale>'s day everyone  smile "

"don't give up it's just the hurt that you hide when you're lost inside  i will be there to find you  don't give up because you want to burn bright  if darkness blinds you, i will shine to guide you  everybody wants to be understood  well i can hear you  everybody wants to be loved  don't give up, because you are loved "
"our lives are not determined by what happens to us but by how we react to what happens, a positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events, and outcomes "
"i learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything    at least not at the same time  so think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them  timing is everything "
i'd love to do a show in vegas with drag queens  the tackier the better  bahaha 3 days i am pretty stoked!

"you save yourself, or you remain unsaved "
"and you say, be still my love open up your heart, let the light shine in  but you don't understand i already have a plan  i'm waiting for my real life to begin "
"you know what they say  once you kill a cow, you gotta make a burger "
"trust is like a mirror, you can fix it if its broke  but you can still see the cracks in that mother f*****s reflection "
"i hit the bulls eye making all the boys cry  i hit the main line breaking through the night sky  like a bullet meant to be shot, you're the target dead on the spot  when i focus i never miss  it starts with a kiss "

"\doubt thou the stars are fire; doubt that the sun doth move; doubt truth to be a liar; but never doubt i love \"""""
"every movie we see, every story we're told implores us to wait for it, the third act twist, the une playful ected declaration of love, the exception to the rule  but sometimes we're so focused on finding our own happy ending we don't learn how to read the signs  how to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't, the ones who will stay and the ones who will leave "
love save the empty
