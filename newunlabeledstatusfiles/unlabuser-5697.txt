have a hollywood christmas and an undead new year
"and i cant get 'round the way you left me out in the open, to leave me to die  so how can i forget the way you lead me through the path into heaven, to leave me behind"
"you are the one who made the decision, stuck in a prison, shattered and broken"
so you look to me to find the truth and what i say is what you do but everyone you look up to is really as fucked up as you time is getting shorter with these enforced disorders and we get blamed to pushed around whose the fuckinâ€™ villain now?
"its been one week since you looked at me, threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy"
"i want you to know, i want you to see  i want you to look beyond your own eyes  past your afflictions  i want you to hurt, want you to bleed  i want you to look beyond your own face  past your infections "
peel me from the skin tear me from the rind does it make you happy now? tear meat from the bone tear me from myself are you feeling happy now?
ducks are the most useless animal and they taste terrible
"let it all burn, i will burn first  god i've tried, am i lost in your eyes? just let me burn, it's what i deserve  god i've lied, am i lost in your eyes?"
just a little story about last christmas  about some bad kids who were full of wishes  we gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin'  the weird kind of love that you give to your cousin
"so we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle, funnier than fuck you can ask <propfirst> kringle  so we all took flight but something was fishy  he asked for road head and started to kiss me  underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows  instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's  i pulled down his beard and it was a monster  it wasn't saint <propmale> it was a fuckin imposter"
"fuck! father, bastard, i'm the devil's very own  mother, know not, just who i've become  father, hate me, for being all your not  mother's baby, i hate what i've become  i hate what i've become  i hate what i've become   "
"with a thousand lies and a good disguise, hit em right between the eyes, hit em right between the eyes  when you walk away nothing more to say, see the lightning in their eyes, see them running for their lives"
"ever haunted by the trappings of this life, sweet redemtion just in front of me"
"seize the day or die regretting the time you lost  it's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over  trials in life, questions of us existing here  don't wanna die alone without you here  please tell me what we have is real "
why <propfirst> ragan   why?!?!?!?!
"take my place and look inside,  i'm trying to find a place to hide, hide   lost my faith but don't you cry  i got a hole inside and it's ten <propmale> wide "
"i see my vision burn, i feel my memories fade with time, but i'm too young to worry  a <propfemale>, a memory, or just one picture"
"so take me and make me, weakened and save me, this hate that you gave me, keeps saying the same thing: to sing when you hurt, and to sing when you cry, to sing when you live, and to sing when you die  and here at the end, at the end of the hurt, all the pain ain't the same, when it's your turn to burn "
"it feels like i'm killin myself  just wheelin myself  just to pray for some help  i'd give it all just to have, have your eternity  cause it's all that assures me  it's worth all that hurts me  i'd give you my heart, and let you just hold it  i'd give you my soul, but i already sold it  on that day that day, the day i walked away in december  i will always remember  i'll regret it forever "
"say, is that rain or are they tears? that stained your concrete face for years  crying, weeping, shedding strife year after year, life after life  a narrow freshly broken ground  a concrete angel laid right down  upon the <propfemale> that swallows fast  it's peace at last  oh, peace at last   "
"would she hear me, if i called her name? would she hold me,if she knew my shame? your tears don't fall, they crash around me her conscious calls, the guilty to come home your tears don't fall, they crash around me her conscious calls, the guilty to come home"
"can you hear the thunder? can you feel the raining force? melt down all your windows, that barricade the doors  mother nature's fury takes you by the hand, showing all but mercy wrecking death upon the land "
"demand me nothing  what you know, you know  from this time forth, i never will speak word "
"on and on although you're gone, candles burn without a flame on  our final call to you, i know you're listening how could you leave us that way? where did you go? (ten years today!)"
"in a world that i dont want to know, with a message that i never want to send, to be free from all of this, i want you to quicken my end  don't tell me i cannot go, when the wound in me refuses to mend, deliver me from all of this, i want you to quicken my end "
"so what's wrong tough guy, why the tears? you drove me to this now you disappear  now all those acts repaid, your turn to be afraid  not longer almost done  oh god just what have i become? try to fight you only make things worse  screams of agony your final verse "
"this battered room i've seen before  the broken bones they heal no more  (no more) with my last breath i've choked in, will this ever end?  i'm hopin' my world is over one more time "
"candles burn slowly, flames shine so brightly  light in the darkness, save me from madness  only the lonely, could possibly know me  heat keeps on rising, fire engulfs me "
what's going on today? why must it be this way? we're going nowhere and we're still knocking the need to bow down they think we're all the same  and always we're to blame for shit i think is lame  it's time to stop the game  i think it's time to pay for everything you made me say 
"round and round you're turnin' me  inside out you're burnin' me  down, down, down you're spillin' me  to the ground you're killin' me"
"it's my funeral,welcome you all this is the end of the line, so thank you for coming along  my time has come, i don't wanna leave you behind, but this one i'll do on my own "
"theres not much longer so dont try and fight, your bodies weakening so walk to the light  all those painfull times so alone so ashamed, i'm not coming back there's nothing to gain "
"god has spoken hrough his conscience  as i scream aim and fire, the death toll grows higher "
"she's got a smile that it seems to me, reminds me of childhood memories, where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky  she's got eyes of the bluest skies  and if they thought of rain, i'd hate to look into those eyes, and see an ounce of pain "
i'm 6-6-sick  6-6-sick  i'm bleeding from internally and burning in eternity  i'm 6-6-sick  6-6-sick

"the clock is ticking, my heart is bursting through my chest  and now i'm crying, the tears are pouring off my face  the chair is creaking, her voice resides inside my head  and now it's over, you put this noose around my neck "
"you will believe my lies, that i'm not like other guys  that <propfemale> in my eyes, is part of my disguise  you're in a place for fear, lips are for biting here  lets make this moment worth the while, lets kill the night and go down in style "

"one by one, we bite the dust  we kick the bucket and begin to rust, give up the ghost when your number's up  we all fall down "
"i saw you look away, is what you've seen to much to take, or are you blind and seeing nothing? i saw you run away  is what i've done to much to take, or are you scared of being nothing?"
"i'm not gonna blame this on you, i know i gave it all i got, no, i'm not gonna blame this on you, i'll tell you that its not your fault  but honestly, you're killing me, i'm sick of us wasting time, i took your heart, tore it apart, watching us die tonight "
