     apparently the skinny bitch inside needs more exercise     i'm just hoping one day she decides to make an appearance  smile 
"<propmale> just stripped <propfemale>'s barbies because he \wanted to see what they looked like under there\"""""
ugh why can't i focus today!
do i really have to be all shiny in every picture of myself? really!  what is with the shiny curse?
seriously what is with my memory!  why do i have so much missing and have to play 21 questions with my friends to fill in the blanks of my adolesence???
so boys don't have to wear shirts because their pimples on their chest are not like girls' pimples just a fyi
another fyi from the profound center of <propmale>'s mind    if you're a boy and your're mexican you don't have to brush your hair because you have mexican hair
"ummm did i mention that <propfirst> bana is hot, hot and oh yeah hot  smile "
the mind is all over the place this morning   lots of things to think about
if i don't laugh i just might cry or go crazy!
feels like i'm going 100 mph constantly   so could use a crazy night out just to be crazy  smile 
really   seriously   crazy   
i have been up since before 5am and can i tell you it is just too early for some things    fuck!
"figures that if it wasn't for the gutter, my mind would be homeless"

some friends are sooo on to you even though you have your front up   
loves the peeps she works with    well most of them anyways some are questionable   
people and circumstances suck lately   
"doesn't mind going to work, it's the 8 hours until i leave that bothers me "
laughter is the closest distance between two people
i don't remember being run over with a truck in my sleep   
"it's dark skies and a little <propfemale> and i didn't melt when i went outside, fall is coming!  i love it!"
i just love doing other people's work it really warms my heart   
dreams are a funny thing    between that and germs it was a long night
"forgot her <propfemale> ball today, so you're gonna need to be more specific!   "
i could really really use some good beer and maybe an extraciricular activity   
i'm not really interested in behaving    
no seriously my big ass was not made for some things   
does whatever the rice krispies tells me to do

"here's an excerpt from my horoscope lol!!    <propfemale> is strong for you right now, aries, and this can work well for you in matters of the heart   you are craving anything that will give you immediate or long term pleasure "

so i knew this week would be long and stupid but i didn't know just wasn't e playful ecting it to be this much of a let down    oh can't i just go to bed and hide under the covers until it's over
seriously alll i wanna do is chill out with some good ol conversation chit chat and some alcohol
just waiting on the other half and chattin with some old friends  smile 
i haven't had a day like this in a long time   
being emotional is draining    i could use some laughs and or giggles any help in this area would be much appreciated  smile 
channeling the mood thru the music not sure it's a good idea tho   
omg it's sooo nice outside and i don't even like spring

its funny how one person can affect you and your mood so much   
i'm kind of freezing it kinda sucks   
people shouldn't be dickheads they just shouldn't   
compliments and true thoughts are gooood people should speak the truth and use them more often

no really i love having a chat that i was looking forward to interrupted by a clothesless baby ass running past my door and giggling lol   
people should shut their face and mind their own business it would be wise   
"ahhh the beneficial therapy of an outta the office no holds barred lunch     venting, laughing, trashing    good times"

if you need fireworks and you're not obligated to any specific booth go to herndon & milburn     bullard talent needs $$ to go washington dc to compete perform!
trying to get schooled in something new that you love is exciting but overwhelming    you just want to be awesome at it cuz it's your passion grrrr

another unit down i'll be running off to be an eccentric photographer any day now lol
what is the deal with the fucktards that are waiting for the bus and feel the need to walk halfway out into the street to see if the bus is coming     seriously    standing in the street like an ass is not going to make the bus magically appear so get the f out of the street and sit your ass on the bench and wait it out before i run you over!
omg the tutu pig died this morning   it's a sad day he was so cute  sad 
did i mention i detest living in fresno this time of year   
catching up on <propmale>

yes the stereo in your ghetto car and your obnoxious voice are both louder than anyone else's on the block     i mean really we all just secretly strive to talk at ridiculous decibel levels on the front lawn as our homies pull up in mass quantity bumping their music i only hope one day i can be as awesome as you    
if it's going to be this hot can't i just stand outside and have my fatness melt off like a popsicle??  i mean really what good is it living in the hot hole of ca if that can't happen

"victory for kicking prop 8 to the curb where it belongs finally!  people need to just get over it & move on   news flash haters it's not about you & it's not about rewriting the bible it's about equal fuckin treatment for all human beings!  this is a country of freedom remember not a dictatorship!  nobody's askin you to do it personally so mind your own business, stop spreading hate and judgement!"
"your hate literally makes me sick to my stomach and breaks my heart all at the same time, i don't know wether to cry or throw up    it just saddens me so so much    i truly hope <propfemale> comes around, gives you a big ol' bitch slap and wakes you the hell up"
"so you get a facebook acct, you make a profile and bio <propfemale>, you accept and request friends and then all you do is play games and post your scores, no socializing or saying hi or posting anything     just game scores     i don't get it what's the point of your fb"
ok i'm thoroughly frustrated with my body    can't i just trade it in   
aww but she's a special cunt   lol
