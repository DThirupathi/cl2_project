"you know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the nba is chinese, the swiss hold the <propfemale>'s cup, <propfemale> is accusing the u s  of arrogance, germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in <propfemale> are named 'bush', '<propmale>', and 'colon'  - <propfirst> rock"
