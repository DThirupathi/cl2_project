just spent about 7 hours studying baptism    it's a good study; you should try it!                 p s  judgmental= not ok
lol what is with all these people complaining about having another day? don't we know when our days are over we're gonna wish we had lived each of them to the fullest?
please pray for my friend <propfirst>  he was supposed to be able to come home today and ended up in a bad situation  just pray for his safety  thanks!
"here's another shout out of a prayer request    my friend <propfirst> is in both a spiritual and court battle for his life, eternal and physical  i'm not the strongest christian, but i'm working on it and i'm really praying that through this somehow <propfirst> can come to christ  i love him so dearly and am asking for prayer both that the court's decision is not too severe and that god will open his eyes to the truth thank you  smile "
"if there's 1 thing i don't get,it's y people don't get it being a christian doesn't suddenly make us better than every1 else   a prostitute,whore,murderer,rapist,cheater,woman beater   it just means that we've fallen on our faces b4 god & pleaded his mercy & forgiveness we're still sinners y look down on or treat somebody like an outcast when if it weren't for god taking pity on us,we'd be in the same exact position?"
