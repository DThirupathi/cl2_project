is already counting down the weeks until spring break    what exactly does that say about her job satisfaction??
"really, really enjoyed avatar, but doesn't see it being the epic phenomenon that others are making it out to be  further, the whole ridiculousness of people being depressed by their lots in life after seeing such a magical environment is loony toon talk  as <propfemale> would say, \seriously??\"""""

"loves random days off from work   slept in, had lunch with <propfemale>, and relaxing with a mani and pedi later this afternoon  she could certainly get used to this!"
is puzzled when people feel the urge to add her as an fb friend and then ignore any comments or posts she makes  really? is it just a contest to see how many friends you can rack up?? seriously   she has enough friends
