"having queries at the surface of ones mind enables cognition, and in return we e playful ress the knowledge that we accumulate with our e playful eriences, which in the big scheme of things, is the most plausible example of knowledge  and since probability of truth is all we have, we have an underlying need to understand more  maybe the means to reach the desires of the heart and mind, lives within the quest for knowledge "
"both reason and sensation, engage in a before and after method of action  rationalizing a sensation though, drowns out our dreams, senses, & feelings  because they are intangible, we reason with ourselves that they will fail us  we argue that there are certain truths, but how can we, when we do not have a knowing of what it is know, isnâ€™t it than, more connected in reason not to know?"
"if passion for a dream, suffocates within the heart, the mind can not\evolve, and the soul ends up pointing a gun at the entire being "
love is awesome
