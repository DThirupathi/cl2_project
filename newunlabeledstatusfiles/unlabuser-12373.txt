wishes he had a certain someone close by his side tonight     he needs a hug     
needs his motor to be done already     come on! > sad 
thinks that he will never feel terrible again!  smile 
"time in one instant may move slow and in another fast, but no matter how its moving the time spent knowing someone loves you is always at a stand still so you may hold onto the moment forever  smile "
so i finally get to see the engine for my car on saturday! it's complete and ready to pick up  smile  can't wait for the fun of ordering more parts and dropping that beast back in its home!
"i've been away for so long  i miss her soooo \much  i never thought that love could make you feel bad and depressed as\ much as this  i will survive though because i know i will always be \welcome back home in your arms ?"
is at a loss for what he should do on his day off tomorrow   parts should be coming for the car but not really any i can use right away   hmmmm i guess i'll just have to wait untill i see what the day brings
had a great day today! feeling good and enjoying the thoughts of the future!  smile 
"was kinda enjoying the middle 60's  sad  oh well at least i can still enjoy the 60's at night while looking at the stars  smile  alas the stars remind me of someone and i miss her a lot   so though i can enjoy the temp i see not stars but a pretty face a pretty smile and a beautiful personality they shine brighter than the sun, and though i miss her i know she is locked away safe in my mind and every beat of my heart  smile "
should leave for work right about now but is super tired couldn't sleep  sad  ok i'm leaving ugh
"got off work early and turned his day into a lazy, carefree, feeling better about himself, rearranging his room, listening to music, watching a <propmale> urban concert on dvd, drinking a milkshake, and thinking about his girl kind of day   smile  awesome"
feels great this morning! got the day off and maybe have some more parts coming in today for the car  gonna clean and repaint the air cleaner today and get some 800 grit sandpaper maybe get the rims worked on   smile 
"\love is unstoppable!\""\",fcc087cbd66542590126edde4bd87f0a,has a huge craving for a hug or a kiss or both from his wonderful far off <propfemale>!  smile  i miss you
"continued    we will all enjoy the rain that comes falling; a cooling sensation and a\ symphony of sorts; the rain steals the heat and the thiunder reports; \the lighning flashes and lights up the sky; a simple yet astonishing \treat for the eye; summer is gone now it left in a hurry; i think in the\ distance i see a flurry  playful "
"feel the breeze on a warm early summers day; the stress of life seems to\ fade away; birds in the distance chirping so happily; it seems a good \day to be outside with family; activities of summer so blissful and \freeing; all that is done seems to come like breathing; off in the \distance a storm is brewing;"
"had a great day yesterday working on the car, texting my awesome gf, and going fishing  let's hope i can do just as well today  smile "
"had another great day! chatting with the most amazing gf throughout the day, went to my brothers graduation ceremony, had some most amazing newyork cheesecake pancakes and iced coffee at ihop, and got some things accomplished on the car   smile "
had a fairly boring day  gave netflix on the wii a good workout haha and got the motor mounts put back on the engine  a big plus is that i got paid to do all that today  smile 
off work early now for some wrenchin on the car  smile     but first lunch haha
got some astronaut ice cream from amazon and a little gift for my sweetheart today  smile  got the exhaust mocked up on the car and did a little gaming  all the wile missing that wonderful girl  i will see you soon my love  love 
is sooooooooooo ready for next weekend to get here!!!!!! come on time move faster!!!   smile 
"kfc: \would you like some cookies for only $ 99?\""\",fcc087cbd66542590126edde4bd87f0a,was on a forklift for six and a half hours and got a pretty mean sunburn    oh well it was fun  smile 
haha still more parts coming from summit racing tomorrow! yay! sadly not the flywheel that i so deperately need to actually put the engine in the car ugh sad   the summer wastes away and no car to go out and play!  classic cars out enjoying the weather wile mine sits in a garage <propfirst> as ever! oh please please make my flywheel come so i can hit the road and have some fun!
as the rain of a summer storm makes a soothing sound outside; i sit and think about how i like the rain  the rain is peaceful; the rain is cooling; the rain brings beauty  the rain brings me closer to you 
"just got an email from summit racing- we just wanted to let you know that we shipped your recent order \part # ctf-700610      flywheel              374 95\ smile  hell yeah!!!!!!!!"
"thinks it's strange that the past couple days he hasn't set his alam clock, but has been waking up early on his own   huh   "
"boo summit racing! how do you idiots send me back the same ford fuel pump that i sent back to you? i need a pontiac one > sad  \come on did you not even open the box when you got it back?"
"spent an amazing weekend with an amazing girl  smile \time, it's a crazy thing  when having fun it's fast and vise versa  this weekend however was different  i was having fun but time was nearly motionless  though the clock says different  but spending time with the one i love is amazing it's like having my own little time pod  one that only she and i can be in, and that is an amazing feeling "
so the flywheel i ordered and waited for is wrong because the crankshaft that was used to rebuild my engine is from an older motor around a 76 or earlier  i ordered one for a 79  the crankshaft register is 2 75 inches on my crank and the flywheel i have measures 2 49 inches  so oh well at least the flywheel i actually need is not backordered  back to summit you go along with that ford fuel pump!
"5 a m  comes too fast  sad  \i wish i had you here; i wish that you were near; i wish that i could've seen that beautiful face; that would've made my heart race; to see you in the morning; to have you next to me smiling; ah a kiss and a hug goodbye; a friendly \have a good day\""   sigh; i miss you in the morning light; a morning without you just doesn't seem right """
correct flywheel coming tomorrow  smile  maybe if it comes early enough in the day i can get the engine back in the car 
"got the motor back in the car after a good, long fight  this car just doesn't like me   never has, and probably never will  but i don't care how much it fights me it will be driven again!!"
"and the sun shines and temperature rises; mother nature is just full of surprises; i wish for rain but at the same time welcome the sun; out in the sun we can have some fun; the rain is calming and cooling to the touch; but even the rain gets old after so much; thunder i will miss and lightning is quite a spectacle; if the sun, thunder, and lightning existed together it would be quite incredible"
yay a whole day tomorrow to work on the car! possibly help a friend install his car stereo too  smile 
"got the exhaust all done and the radiator installed  i hope to have the car done by this weekend  smile  i had a good day  i got the most wonderful surprise in the mail! a card from my love!  smile  it brought about a wonderful happiness from deep inside  it made me cry tears of joy  a card with sound   a wonderful \i love you\"" and a perfect song by lonestar  thank you so much hun! love you babe!  love """
"is going to give summit one more <propmale> at giving me the right fuel pump- only because ordering one from an auto parts store will take too long-i even paid for next day delivery, so the moment of truth for summit keeping a customer will be tomorrow  then if it is the right one we should be hearing a monster come to life later tomorrow night  smile "
"got the car running but the engine has an exhaust leak at the intake manifold  can i get a break? please!? now i have to call auto <propmale>'s cuz they messed up ugh!!! the good thing is the engine runs very well!!! i haven't even tuned the carburetor or adjusted the timing yet, and it still runs, sounds, turns over, starts, and looks better than it ever did before  smile "
is gonna have the new best weekend of his life!!!
awesome weekend!!!!  smile  you are amazing love  love 
"loves driving his car but wishes it would stop fighting him  i can't wait for it to be perfect so i can cruise with my beautiful, wonderful, amazing girlfriend!!  smile "
"got his new computer finished!!!\new computer's stats: amd phenom ii x4 at 3 4 ghz--msi sli ready motherboard with nvidia nforce 980-g65 chip--8 gb corsair dominator ddr3 dual channel ram 1333 mhz---nvidia gtx 260 oc graphics card with 898 mb ram--850 watt antec power supply--lg blu-ray player burner--hitachi cd dvd burner--card reader--480gb hdd--windows 7 ultimate 64 bit--8 fans"
"the days go by; i'm almost getting tired of being this guy; the kindness i show, the generosity i bestow; never appreciated you know?; why are people so rude and disrespectful?; i'd like to be vengeful; i'd like to say go to hell;how do i hold back so well; i do nothing, i won't change ever; i like me too much i'll stay like this forever!; so nice try all you people you can't win!; i'll just say hi and smile again!"
 smile 
just found out what it's like eating mcnuggets and dipping them in bbq sauce wile driving   it's not too bad   didn't even get any bbq on me  smile  oh! and a frappÃ© to go with it delicious!
thinks it's pretty entertaining to watch the cone of a speaker vibrate and bounce as it produces the wonderful sound and beat of music!  smile
