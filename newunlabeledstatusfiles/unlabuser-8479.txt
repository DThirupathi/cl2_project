belly dancing has got to be one of the sexist and most enjoyable exercises  it really brings out your inner goddess 
the one you just called fat? she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs the one you just called stupid? she has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night  the one you just called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her  the one you just tripped? she is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  put this as your status if you're against bullying
