"q:  would you say we are good friends?  a:  i suppose so, i don't believe you've ever done me wrong, and i suppose i can trust you pretty well "
"q:  if there were 100 dicks on the wall, how many would you choke on?  a:  to be honest, probably most of them, no gag reflex "
"q:  how was your opinion of me changed after you got to know me better?  a:  hmm, i don't think it changed much at all   your \out there\"" behavior is apparent from the start   haha """
"q annoyed   how was your opinion of me changed after you got to know me better  a annoyed   can't say, really   for a while, i disliked you not because \you were a bad person, but because you were too upbeat for my tastes, \but over time, either i changed or you chilled out, because we get along\ pretty well now "
"q:  do you haaaaate meee?  frowny   a:  haha, not at all   perhaps we just haven't really gotten to know each other "
q:  why does your default look so emo?  a:   surprise   i'm not sure   it's not uncommon that i take a picture that i think has a nice feel while most others find it to be dark or saddening   haha 
"q:  why do you constantly act hateful and treat me like an idiot?  a:  mixed, non-mutual emotions "
