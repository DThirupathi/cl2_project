ahhh    peace again tonight    gotta love hockey nights!
"i am really amazed at how some people get such a kick out of other people being unhappy   that just shows me just how unhappy these people are   it's sad, really   there are some people who would do anything to try to help other people and it usually backfires in some way    that doesn't make it funny, it's life     grow up people, life is short, do what you can and learn from everything "
"got a lot accomplished today   got to shoot, breathe in some oc powder when i couldnt breathe anyway, swing a baton around and then clean my kitchen when i got home    time to relax now  smile "
watching christmas movies with my girls again      and relaxing  smile 
tryin to figure out what i want to eat for dinner
"not looking forward to the next week without my girls      i hope it goes by fast!  i really am starting to hate holidays, especially when there are so many stupid people in this world "
cleaned my garage and put up christmas lights for my girls for when they come home  now that i sat down i am really tired 
had just a wonderful day working today         
"got to freeze my butt off at work today and deal with stupid people all day today, but then again, i do that every day   really getting tired of the bullshit and people acting stupid and having to give people instructions on how to do everything when they are adults and can watch and learn for themselves "
trying to plan what i'm gonna do while i'm on vacation 
<propfemale> christmas to all who get to enjoy it   i hope all that do appreciate their families and loved ones and getting to be with them because not all are that fortunate 
"had a nice evening with friends and family (ex-in-laws), a niece who made the evening a little easier, since i miss my own kids, who will be home tomorrow! i can't wait to have them home again!"
totally blessed to have 2 of the best daughters i could ever ask for!  i am so glad to have them home again!  i couldn't ask for a better christmas present!
thought i got paid today  sad  guess i'll have to do all my runnin around tomorrow 
how many fake teenager shows can there possibly be on the disney channel?  at least in cartoons kids understand that is not real life     but with real people in them they think it is real and that's how life is supposed to be 
what is it about the beach boys and the beatles that always make you feel good?
kids go back to school tomorrow   i wish they had another week of vacation  sad 
"put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered baby loss ??? the majority won't put it on, because unlike cancer, baby loss is a taboo ??? break the silence ??? in memory of all the ~angel~ babies gone- too soon but never forgotten about !!"

sorry guys!  i am just venting about these people that know absolutely nothing about me who want to interfere in my life and talk about something that is none of their business   nothing was intended toward any of my friends on here 
i thought mondays were only supposed to be bad when you are at work?
camping trip to mammoth on wednesday!  can't wait but still so much to do!
today was the best 4th of july i have ever had!  spent the day watching my girls have fun at the park and then headed to lancaster and watched the fireworks with one of the nicest guys i have met in a long time  smile 
"ok i really feel old now  sad   i somehow managed to pinch a nerve in my neck or back and now have very limited movement of my head, neck, upper back and right arm!  not good!  thank god i have a high pain tolerance because this is pretty bad!"

well had a kinda stressful day today with the fire too close to home but evening ended great with the best kids and man i could ask for   smile 
what did i do to be this lucky?  smile 
finally friday but no 3 day weekend for me
why does life have to be so complicated?
missing my friend
damn songs (and thoughts) in my head won't let me sleep!!!! lol someone is gonna pay for this!
"why is it that people feel they can tell you their opinion but when you tell them yours they get all offensive   i do what i can to give my kids what they need  thanks to those who support me, fuck everyone who doesn't  i've proven you wrong before, i can do it again!"
"seduce my mind and you can have my body, find my soul and i'm yours forever "
would be awesome if i could sleep!
ugh not feeling very good  sad 
    don't let the sadness of your past & the fear of your future ruin the happiness of your present
what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
life ain't always beautiful     
how many times can your heart be broken before it can't be healed?
"love is a shelter in a raging storm   love is peace in the middle of a war   \no, love is not a fight but it's something worth fighting for "
all i want is happiness for everyone and i keep hurting everyone that i love   this isn't how i wanted things to be 
why can't our lives have the happy endings that are in movies? and why does everything have to hurt so much? they don't show that in the movies 
missing my everyone that makes my life complete  sad 
"thankful for all the people who have entered my life      i wouldn't be who i am today if not for these people   i'm also thankful that some are no longer in my life because that has made me an even better person   there are those who i would give anything to have with me, and they will be home soon where they belong   i am also thankful to all my friends who have stood by me through everything  smile "
"what lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you  ~ <propmale> <propmale> <propmale>"
can't sleep     can't get warm and the wind needs to stop   sad 
wishing my brain had an off switch so i could sleep  sad 
is there something wrong with me when i fight my boredom by volunteering to go to work?
feel like crap      gonna snuggle up in bed and watch a movie i think
"i do not wish to be everything to everyone, but i would like to be something to someone "
really hating tehachapi and it's damn wind!
faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe 
"at the request of a facebook friend - we are asking everyone to say a prayer for \darkhorse\"" 3rd battalion 5th marines and their families they are fighting it out in afghanistan and have lost 9 marines in 4days  please re-post this  it would be nice to see it on          everyone's   wall!! even if its only for an hour """
would give anything to be asleep right now 
amazing how 16 hours of being at work seems like nothing when i would otherwise be bored sitting at home 
"\loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty \"" \",4842b9b2bda9ba9696bb3b3d10176857,"change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same  until monday (dec 6th) there should be no human faces on facebook, but an invasion of memories  this is for a campaign against violence on children  so do it!"
brrrrr            can't get warm  sad 
i hate when i am looking for something and i can't find it but i know it's here 
i can't change what's been and gone  it's made me the person i am today  i'm not perfect but i'm happy and the only people who matter are those who love me xxx
waiting again as usual        
woo hoo!  no longer in criminal status!  no more court for anything other than my kids!
really hate seeing people i care for deeply waste their love on people who only take advantage of and play head games with them   and there's absolutely nothing i can do but sit back and watch them get hurt over and over again  sad 
i hate waiting in a room full of disgusting dirty drug abusing lowlifes  hurry up and get this day over with already!
one baby home     2 more to go  smile 
"loves when people try to cause problems in my life because they are jealous  hate me if you must, but i have something you will never have "
can't believe my life is important enough that you talk about it to everybody  sorry your life isn't worth talking about 
<propfemale> christmas everyone!  thank you to all my friends and family      you give me the best present anyone could ask for  smile 
hopes everyone had a great christmas   i definitely enjoyed my day  smile   got to be with the most important people in my life today     best christmas present ever!
finally! a whole day to spend with my baby!
"feeling like you're not good enough is the worst feeling, but that's something i e playful erience everyday "
"sitting here, bored out of my mind, can't sleep and can't stop thinking about someone "
"ya know, i hate it how people are so nice to you and try so hard when they want something,  but totally ignore you when they don't"
finally home from a fun-filled night of what some of us call work  time for me to do my own sleep study     
"really hate rude, impatient people "
wind and a sick child      2 of the many things keeping me from sleeping yet again tonight

really tired of living on empty hopes and dreams and being teased with happiness to have it all taken away
