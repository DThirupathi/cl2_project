i finally made a facebook so you people can quit complaining  smile 
"do you think people can change? and if so, how do you know? how do you convince someone who possess no trust? \forgiveness is the final form of love\"" they say  i guess this is why i feel so cold about love """
i have nothing to do since school is done  i'm going to stuff my fat face with ice cream now  smile 
"i get about 6 weeks of vacation each year from school and there's no such thing as a summer vacation for me  i have 2 weeks off before classes begin again, so i have a great excuse to be lazy and fat for once  smile "
"why is everyone rushing to get married? i need to build a future for myself first with a professional career, financial stability, e playful ectations for my children, and satisfaction before i can make such commitment  it's better to prepare and be thorough because marriage is not trial and error "
"my summer tuition is $3,100! ahhh! i hate being a broke college kid  i hope this will pay off in the future  annoyed "
"so i'm riding through the city with my high beams on  can you see me? can you see me? get your visine on  y'all just do not fit the picture  turn your widescreen on  if you think i'm going to quit before i die, dream on "
"my profile is public because i have nothing to hide  however, i do closely monitor what i share on facebook because of my affiliations with school and professional organizations  i do have a myspace where i write anything and everything about my life that may be somewhat irrelevant to people on facebook  ask for it "
"i'm tired of unprofessional employees who do a half-ass job in order to complete their responsibilities  employers need to quit hiring cheap labor and instead, look for people with actual skills who do things thoroughly  if i have to work hard to accomplish things correctly, then people need to stop being careless and begin doing their job properly "
"this weekend was the worst weekend eeveeerrr! now, i have to return back to school    again  ugghh, the story of my life! sometimes, i feel that if i was simple-minded and didn't reflect about everything in this world, in addition to being lazy and not wanting to attend school    life would be so much easier "
"i can't believe i paid more than $3,000 to attend school for 9 hours m-f, read 3 chapters of the textbook per day, and take exams every week    during my summer vacation    and i'm not even a doctor yet! no wonder doctors have high suicidal rates  annoyed "
"i have an interview with baylor college of medicine, department of psychiatry on 6 18 for a research assistant position in clinical psychology  3 interviews down, 2 more to go  if i get this position, i'm disregarding all the others because this may be my one-way ticket to baylor college of medicine medical school  smile "
"i have so much things to do and not enough time to do it all  i'm never taking 5 summer classes ever again! it's even more stressful because i need to maintain my a's for med school    i can't wait till the weekend; woo hoo, i get to have a life! by the way, where do you find ahi poke in <propmale>? i want some lol "
"i was offered to be in a hip-hop music video for magno and throw'd in may  it's great e playful osure, but all for the wrong reasons    and everything i do would be a contradiction  i gladly turned down the opportunity "
"biological sciences and laboratory are the most tedious subjects ever    next to chemistry and physics, of course  and american history is just plain useless "
"glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration are confusing me! additionally, they are killing all of my brain cells  annoyed "
"i'm such a threat to these school kids  i started without a coin; not knowing which way i'm going  now, i'm traveling on boeings and writing a few poems  weathered all of the storms, now it's time to see the light  i never felt this way about anything in my life  determined to be the best; not looking back at regrets  how many people i bless, is how i measure success "
"i got the position as a research assistant for the department of psychiatry at one of the best medical schools in the nation--baylor college of medicine  instead of talking about what you plan to do, search for opportunities and execute your plans  this is what seperates those who are living their dreams from people who only dream about living "
"i hate the rain in <propmale>  i was driving to school and felt as though i was driving through a black hole lol! so, i missed class today  thanks hurricane "
"different goals require different trade-offs  i'm not a sociopath lol, but to accomplish what i <propfemale>, i need to accept the trade-offs (e g , not going out, studying all day, having less friends)  i realized that most people do not understand why i do the things that i do  but then again, not everyone has the intentions of being a physician "
i'm currently in summer school learning about molecular genetics  this is so awesome! (<propmale> sarcasm)
"online commotion? lame  it is pathetic when people are unable to validate their arguments so they attack your appearance and make assumptions about your personality  intelligent people argue about ideas and concepts, while simple minded people gossip about other people "
"today in lab, we constructed a recombinant dna plasmid and transformed e  coli cells, with and without ampicillin resistance, to recipient cells  when i came home later, i felt all sick "
"my professor, with a ph d  in ecology and evolution, was ecstatic today since it was the second time that a student received 100% on the exam    in 24 years haha! and it was not me lol  rice university and ut-austin students cannot even keep up with this teacher lol damn, fuck my life lol haha "
"my parents make sacrifices to put me through school  i came from a struggling family with no money and education  i worked hard to gain the credentials that i have  if my parents want to lend me a hand so that i can succeed as a physician, what's the problem? i do this for my family; i dedicate my successes to all of my enemies "
"stages of love include physical attraction, romantic feelings, and emotional attachment  however, forgiveness is the final form of love "
"some girl, who lives in my apartment complex, was found dead this morning in the middle of the road    in front of our driveway  i'm scared to look  it would be the second homicide i have seen since i have been here  surprise "
what pisses me off the most is when uneducated people underestimate my work ethics  i left my job as a well-paying paralegal to obtain my 2nd degree  studying to become a physician is work and maintaining straight a's is even worse  try doing it yourself  what seperates me from you is that you do whatever you can and i do whatever i choose 
"i noticed that my status updates are usually thoughts rather than events  i guess i am more of a philosopher than a storyteller  therefore, let's think for a minute    question of the day: why are elderly people called â€œold peopleâ€� but children are never called â€œnew peopleâ€�?"
"people have certain aspirations for all the wrong reasonsâ€”money, fulfilling family e playful ectations, and meeting societal standards  however, doing something without passion will make your life miserable or even worseâ€¦ cause you to fail  question of the day: if you have x-ray vision and you can see through anything, wouldn't you see through everything and actually see nothing?"
"question of the day: a wife always cooks for her husband; however, her husband never cooks for her  then, he has the audacity to get upset because she did not wash the dishes  what do you call this? perhaps she was tired from cooking for him and needed a break  nevertheless, maybe he is the one who should be washing the dishes in return for the lovely daily dinners his wife always prepare for him "
"do i look like a fucking mexican housewife to you, you fucking piece of shit "
"i am getting a headache from being the middle person in this home-searching journey  i thought submitting a contract to purchase a new house was simple  now, i find out that the home already has multiple offers  i really want this house, i dislike competing with others, and i especially hate losing  fuck you  i am making my offer with cashâ€¦ and i will continue to insist until i get the house "
people who begin first do not always last the longest  it is always better to make sacrifices now and plan for your future rather than focus on present money  it is unfortunate that many people become easily distracted by quick money and lose sight of what they would like to acquire in life 
"wow, i can actually feel my brain growing! i used to despise chemistry, but somehow i have been solving all of the problems correctly  smile  i think i am starting to enjoy inorganic chemistry 2 after all lol  it is true; we learn to enjoy the things we do well in  question of the day: have you noticed that if the letters in mother in law were rearranged, the new words would be woman hitler? haha!"
"critics think iâ€™ve lost my touch  if iâ€™m not the realest one who has ever done it, iâ€™m not off by much  so, donâ€™t stop me if iâ€™m chasing my dream in the fast <propfirst>; speeding, no safety belt  itâ€™s a marathon, so pace yourself  in this race for wealth, talking shit is just a waste of breath  chasing me is like chasing your tail; youâ€™re never going to catch it  respect is something youâ€™ll never get if you never had it "
"anything is possible; however, knowing someone for 2 weeks and loving them with all of your heart sounds a bit absurd  i hope you are not willing to die for them also  teenagers today are so quick to misuse the word â€œloveâ€�, then they wonder why commitment issues are increasing and why â€œi love youâ€� seems insignificant to so many people  please shut your face, thanks  smile "
"i had 8 hours of school yesterday, my first and only meal was at 4 smile 0pm, and lots of homework needed to be done once i came home  the only differences between your job and mine is that you get paid and never have to take your work home with you  you all should be grateful  however, i am passionate about what i do and i am also good at it  this is a marathon but i would never trade in my goals just to make fast money "
"can i get that benz? can i get that bentley? can i get that chevy? no, the one with the hemi  can i get the lamborghini on the top top shelf? can i get stones all around my ri-ri-ri-ri-rims? diamonds in my ri-rims? oh, iâ€™m sorry iâ€™m really not that crazy  iâ€™m like that white boy; you know, slim shady  and i be rapping circles around these rappers on the daily and maybe a little bit crazy for blatantly blaming rabies "
"our cash offer for the house was accepted over five other offers! now, i am waiting for the addendum to be generated so we can proceed with closing  built in 2005, 2-story, 4 bedrooms, 2 5 baths, and 1 owner for $69,000 cash  great deal huh? it is true that paying with cash has its advantage  i am so excited to move out of the ghetto! *crosses fingers*"
"yâ€™all tickle me, literally; elementary literati  this is my apostasy; now, check out my philosophy  this industry is monopoly; yâ€™all manipulate and copy me  now, put your people up against me and watch them keep flopping, g  i never give up on anything that i do; ask my boyfriend, as he is the one who witnesses me doing work over and over again until it is 100%  i feel bad for my competitors "
"political science quizzes = a, political science exam = a, biology quiz = a, biology exam = a, american literature to 1865 exam = next week, inorganic chemistry ii exam = next week; but fuck my life because it requires calculus  the last time that i took calculus was two years ago  it is easy but i hate the calculations  sad "
"research assistant meeting at the psychological research center then conference with 12 physicians and doctorates on the topics of fmri-based evaluations on traumatic brain injuries and neurorehabilitationâ€¦ in which i was fortunate to attend! now, my brain cells hurt, my finger is about to fall off, and i need to study for my inorganic chemistry ii exam (which is written by someone who wrote the freaking mcat)  boo!"
"i just received a letter from the <propfemale> key international honour society for a 4-year university  they said that i am within the top 15% of 35,000 students from my university and i am invited to the new member recognition ceremony on december 3rd  i will also be awarded a $1000 scholarship  yay, another honor society for me to join  smile "
"kehanu said i was stupid; 3 9 gpa college graduate with 2 degrees, aiza said i would work at burger <propmale>; i do research at baylor college of medicine, mrs  huntley laughed at med school; top 15% of my university and pre-medical honor society, girls called me a slut; age 23 and never been pregnant  put them haters up against me and watch them keep flopping, g "
"i used to pride myself on my individuality because i thought that being different was good  however, i realized that being a good person is different enough "
"biology quiz: class average = 56, class median = 60, my grade = 100  now, do you understand why i strive to be far from average? this does not only apply to grades, but to life in general  i have high e playful ectations and set great aspirations for myself  being a perfectionist is not a gift, it is an illness  to comprehend why i do the things that i do, you need to understand my painful past "
many people associate criticism with â€œhatingâ€�  there is a difference between talking shit because you are envious of someone and laughing at someone because they are just plain stupid 
"i was presented with the opportunity to be 1st author of a research article  this is intimidating since many published researchers are m d  or ph d  only a few people actually publish scientific research articles  conferences, research, publications, honor societies, possible guaranteed admission to med schoolâ€”i do not know where to begin  however, i will make it big; i promise this "
my biology exam was so difficult that the professor had to curve the grades tremendously  67 74% is a b and 81 56% is an a  hahaha!
"some people think that i am arrogant  no; i am proud of my achievements and i openly admit my flaws  i can be obnoxious, loud at times, have a bad temper, i can't sing, i probably can't cook, i have no artistic or musical talents, i need glasses, i think too much, my mom says that i am controlling like a dictator lol, i am probably boring, and i do not care what others think  i am not conceited; i am honest "
"if you have something rare such as a lamborghini murciÃ©lago, then why the hell would you start looking for a honda civic? the streets are infested with them, you can find them used, and everyone owns one  why would you want to be average and have something average? this is my relationship metaphor  if you upgraded, then stay upgraded dummy "
"i spoke with my academic advisor today and since i already have 150+ credit hours, she said that i am going to receive dual degrees instead of a double <propmale>  bachelor of science in psychology and bachelor of science in biology, yeessss!"
"forget five stars, iâ€™m something like the galaxy; so galactic  blowing up haters like sodium bicarbonate; chemical reactant  fuck lety and beydi; i kill them with my success like gunplay  iâ€™m aka â€œoh beastâ€� like a weight problem; eat them like entrees  i say this because â€œi kane (can) and they are not <propmale> (able)â€�  they are average, like the average employment rate; unstable "
"i am freezing because texas is turning into the arctic ocean, my eye is messed up because i walked into the fence while trying to save my dog, i called in sick because i have a headache, if i sit on the computer for another 8 hours    i could possibly finish all of my work, and i am contemplating whether or not i should take calculus ii during winter break  there is no time for a vacation in my life "
"many teenage girls may have a body of a woman but still possess a mind of a child  it is disturbing to see that most of them focus only on external beauty rather than intellectual beauty and morals  your appearance does not define who you are  stop caring so much about clothes and makeup; go learn something  when you are older and your appearance fades, your brain will become essentially useless to society "
"leave impressions; unforgettable; my position; irreplaceable  shittinâ€™ on these bitches, something like stains â€œunfadableâ€�  iâ€™m legendary; my swaggerâ€™s exceeding extraordinary  compared to the rest, i have a ph d  to practice as a visionary  simply complicated and amazingly very intellectual  â€œpast, present, futureâ€”doing me; you should see my scheduleâ€� "
"no research work for two weeks, the most difficult exams are over, american literature essay completed, received a 99 91999998% on my biology exam lol, the weather is still warm, taking a trip to atlanta during thanksgiving weekend, purchasing another puppy, the new house is awesome, and best of all    no rent or mortgage payments    ever  yay, life is good right now  smile "
"people are copying my status and profile lol  how the fuck does my successes and tribulations reflect your life? if you are trying to replicate me, at least fucking spell properly  i canâ€™t be replaced or duplicated, only emulated and copied  attempting to utilize my vocab, but you still sound hella sloppy  iâ€™m lyrically beyond your level, scientifically  specifically, spitting out the bitch in me; prolifically "
"i received an award the other night from the international honor society in psychology    and free food! i love food  anyway, i also scored top 4% out of 740 students in biology  it is too bad that i cannot say the same for inorganic chemistry lol  nevertheless, i would love for your dumb ass to copy my status again, seeing that this also applies to your life lol *sarcasm* "
"hmm    i am seriously thinking about transferring to rice university next year  the school ranks 17 out of 4,350 universities in the united states  required: 3 50 gpa or higher    check, two professor recommendation letters    check, $70 for application fee    check, and $35,000 annual tuition cost    umm how will i afford this? *crosses fingers* help financial aid help!"
"sometimes, i wonder why i decided to sacrifice 15 years of my life to become a physician and face over $100,000 in debt just to save other people's lives  most people are too lazy to even try to maximize their potentials, let alone appreciate the value of life  i'm struggling to help ungrateful people who are unmotivated to do anything for themselves  take advantage again and i'll dog you when you need me the most "
"wow, i think i need some psychological help  i had a dream about chemical redox equations the other night  i was literally balancing chemical reduction-oxidation equations in my sleep lol  well, perhaps this may not be a negative thing  maybe <propfirst> einstein was superiorly intelligent because he was solving quantum physics problems during sleep lol "
"no demonstration of comradery, this may sound like some atrocity, haters are going to follow me; i can't let this bother me, no longer come from poverty, people think this is a monstrosity, but this industry's monopoly, a visionary making prophecies, i'm not emotional; only focused and precise; no apologies  don't attempt to copy and paste what you can't understand "
"<propmale> to atlanta  we just arrived to atlanta a few hours ago, yeesss! it's a lot different than i e playful ected    less buildings than <propmale> and a bunch of trees all over the place lol  well, have a wonderful gobble gobble day everyone!"
"if you had x-ray vision and were able to see through anything, wouldn't you see through everything and actually see nothing at all? haha! i'm in school for another week or two then i can finally have my first vacation of the year, yay!"
"fucking backstabbers; during struggling times you just laughed at us, now you're about to feel the fucking wrath of this aftermath, faggots  you see me in my lab jacket; you can kiss my persistent ass, crack maggots  success is the best revenge to pay you back; i overcame odds to get even and now i'm baaack, bastards "
"many people know chemistry, but my psycho professor intentionally writes his own problems so that people can't look it up  i need help  i'll give $10 to anyone who can help me solve this lol  determine the value of ?gÂº at 25 Âºc for the reaction: hclo(aq) + nh3(aq) <=> nh4+(aq) + clo-(aq) given that <propfemale> of hclo(aq) = 3 5 x 10-8, kb for nh3 = 1 8 x 10-5 and kw = 1 0 x 10-14 "
"i absolutely despise people who constantly take advantage of hardworking individuals  it's amazing how polite they are when they need assistance, but illustrate no gratitude afterwards  kind people made sacrifices to help you  if it wasn't for them, you wouldn't be shit  sadly, you're the type who's only triumphant when you are shadowed by someone else's success "
"many people are offended with the cartoon pictures, while others believe it's supporting a worthy cause  according to abc news, this idea began in greece and cyprus in mid-november  its original intention was to only bring back childhood memories  this had nothing to do with child abuse  to offended people, chill out  to others, this didn't quite help with child abuse awareness  do your research people "
"i precisely calculate each e playful ression in my rhymes, parallel to mayan astronomy  damaging illiterate sesame rhymes with frontal lobe mutilation, similar to a lobotomy  verbal articulation of my life; more factual and formulated than philosophical logic  while you make up words like a brain dead infant on methylene chloride and hooked on phonics  haha! i did it again "
"question of the day: how do we deal with compulsive liars who are notorious at lying? additionally, how do we learn to forgive liars who repeat the same mistakes and are unwilling to admit their faults?"
"little boys with testosterone poisoning always want to race me, cut me off, and peel off in my face    without knowing that it's a female driving  they are disrespectful and always demonstrating road rage (in their stupid rental cars that won't be paid off for years lol), but none of them would step out of their vehicles to do shit "
"sooooo    i just received an invitation from the national space biomedical research institute to work as a paid intern and do biomedical research at nasa <propmale> space center  although biomedical research is awesome, i'm not sure how nasa will benefit me  additionally, the drive from my house to nasa is about two hours  sad  whhyyy?!!"
"one more biology final tomorrow and yesss i get to breathe for the first time this year  i'm so excited to do absolutely nothing for a month  as graduation, medical school applications, and more research work approach    i may never receive another vacation again "
"little females using their sex appeal to get representation rather than their intellect and talent    are not attractive  also, rappers who make up words and use third grade grammar do not appeal to the intelligent  finally, middle school children having sex    hahahahahaha *closes eyes* "
"wow, it's a miracle! this will be my shortest status update ever  i am officially brain dead for the next three to four weeks  smile "
"i just met the in-laws for the first time last night and i'm already spending the whole day with them by myself    oh my gosh    wow  i also realized that you only need a 3 0 cumulative gpa, a personal statement, college transcript, 3 recommendation letters, and a $50 application fee to enroll in graduate school and obtain a master's degree  wow, are you serious   "
"no computer access or cell phone service because i am in mexico  instead of having 2 lanes on each side for the cars to pass, they have 1 5 lanes  also, they put to-go drinks in a plastic bag lol  it reminds me of vietnam  smile "
iÂ´m still in mexico so iÂ´m unable to comment people  iÂ´m using a 1 gb computer with slow ass internet  i didnÂ´t know mexicans dance hula and tahitian lol what the fuck haha!
"there is a difference between defending your principles because you're a strong woman and constantly complaining about insignificant shit because you're a bitch  men are attracted to females with courage, not females with attitude  possessing a bitch attitude doesn't depict independence, strength, or elegance  it actually makes you sound like a little girl immersed in drama  get it right, little one "
"it's not my fault that your parents don't give a shit about you  i received a scholarship for college, you dumb fuck  maybe if you weren't so fucking stupid, you would get one too and not blame your parents for your lack of education  don't fucking talk sideways to me and then delete me, you fucking pussy "
"i love my employer! i missed research work today because of my stupid car, but she was extremely understanding about the situation and even thanked me for the work done on wednesday  she also allows me to make my own work schedule and choose to do whatever tasks that appeal to me  i guess it's true that with hard work and a higher education, there's more room for freedom in your job "
"how can someone write a paragraph e playful laining that everything they do, say, and feel come authentically from them    when the same paragraph was copied and pasted from another website    which was written by someone else? that just totally defeated and contradicted its purpose lol "
"i admire people with passion and perseverance who attempt to fulfill their aspirations at whatever costs  if their plans are hindered due to uncontrollable circumstances, it's completely understandable  however, i don't feel pity for people who failed at accomplishing their goals due to the careless and unwise decisions they have made in life "
"people say that you are who your friends are and that they influence the way you act  this is the reason why i roll solo and don't even like cats  instead of complaining about me, why don't you people stop slacking and keep up? i've never made an excuse for anything that went wrong in my life  i take full accountability for my mistakes, but i will also take full accountability for my achievements  it goes both ways "
"applied for financial aid and hopefully will receive $5,550, in the process of applying for scholarships again, have to hustle quickly at work tomorrow in order to make it to my orthodontist appointment, will take off my braces soon, excited to save money again, property taxes are giving me a headache, will take the mcat soon, need to sell my car, blah blah blah    but life is still good  smile "
"i hate when people scream in an argument without making any legitimate or intelligent statements  they think that their loud voices will intimidate people and will make everyone shut up  yapping chihuahuas don't intimate me  i can be as loud as 194db also, but i actually make sense  screaming in a confrontation is like the special olympics; win or lose, you're still retarded "
"first day of the semester is tomorrow  my first class is genetics, hmm    mendelian, molecular, and population genetics    this should be interesting    and difficult  i also applied to memorial hermann as a volunteer  i made a request to be placed in icu, surgery, or a nursing unit  i'm excited to e playful and my e playful erience and i'm almost done with my second degree, yeeesss!!!"

"scholarship season! i'm in the process of applying for scholarships again *sigh* headaches, headaches, and more headaches  most people have no idea how tedious the process is  you work hard to qualify, you work harder to apply for 34328563285 of them, and you work the hardest in order to receive and keep them  contrary to those who think that i'm spoiled, this is how i receive opportunities    through hard work "
"stop your overt and repetitive complaining! if it's too difficult for you to concentrate in a 3 hour class, then you shouldn't have signed up for it  you want to become a teacher to mentor other students, therefore, why don't you learn something for yourself in order to successfully teach others and stop whining about school? you don't like to educate yourself, but your <propmale> is education  hmmâ€¦ contradiction "
"in regards to my family, don't ever fucking interfere with their accomplishments or distract their focuses  i'm the epitome of motivation and persistence, and i'm motivated to fuck up your life like a junking slamming drugs  leave hard workers alone or i will make you regret your own fucking existence  i don't get mad, i get even; ask my ex-friends  mentality of a g; i never let a bitch lil bow wow me  come again  smile "
"it's ridiculous when people attend the same school as their friend, take the same classes as their friend, rent a place with their friend, move to the same city as their friend, and work with their friend  life isn't middle school  you need to lead your own life, possess your own aspirations, maximize your own potentials, and exceed average "
"everyone judges everyone  we don't have the time to cognitively process everyone's life in detail, so we use heuristics (cognitive short-cuts) to make quick inferences and attributions about them  whether we are correct or wrong, this is part of the human evolutionary process and it simplifies our life  it's not about who judges you on what and how  it's a matter of how well you're able to ignore them and move on "
"you can never replace a breadwinner with a chicken head dinner  competition? yes, i would love some! exclamation <propfirst> for emphasis  i don't sympathize with you, little girl, because you're a simple bitch lol  time to do some work and e playful and my knowledge  sad  my life is boring lol  have a wonderful day everyone!"
"my employment status changed  i'm now a federal employee who does research at a medical school and medical center  awesome, right? no! this will be helpful for the future (if i decide to stay with the va), but currently, i'm a student and i see this opportunity as more of an internship since i'm not being compensated as a federal employee  a broke federal employee lol that's even more embarrassing "
"this girl said that she gave birth to stillborn twins after being hit by a drunk 18-wheeler driver  no injuries, no news report, no medical records, no state attorney statement, no sonograms, doesn't know anything about the driver's sentencing, and her proof is a fake internet picture    all this to be with her boyfriend  she brought pain upon his family and still continues to lie  what a sick fucking little bitch "

"hello little girl, please return to myspace and stop infesting facebook with your drama-seeking attitude, childish beliefs, and whorish appearance; it's not cool  on a happier note (with a very helpful advice), if you can't beat them, join them  this is what i told myself when i couldn't exceed my mentors and professors; jealous people should do the same  learn from the best and disregard the rest  smile "
"seeing billboards around the city about university of <propmale> being a tier one research university just made my whole month! i was contemplating about my transfer to rice university; however, i think that i'll remain here  i'm pretty proud of my school now  nevertheless, i have a serious genetics exam this week so bye bye facebook  smile "
i wanted to clean up my facebook so i made another one
