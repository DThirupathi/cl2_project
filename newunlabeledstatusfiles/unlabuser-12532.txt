"time is of the essence and in this business it isnt just time its money so when you say you want an awesome deal with great long term happiness and friendship with your saleswoman be upfront and honest and go through dont waste time and then not do what you say you will  cuz when you waste my time im loosing money every second im working my butt off to get the best for you and then you fall through, because why????"
"faith\\faith is like a candle flame, a glow that keeps us strong, and faith is there to see us through when things seem to go wrong \\life's not always easy, we're bound to have some sorrow \\but faith can help to get us through, to a better day tomorrow  so when you burn this candle, and you see its steady light  remember that your faith will help, make dark days seem more bright!"
