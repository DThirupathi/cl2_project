"i think i'm just not into the whole \facebook games\"" anymore  sorry for those whoo keep on sending me app invites """
"also, i think i want to get my hair done blue "
"\the descent into hell is easy \"" - <propfirst> \""the aenid\"""""
okay  i have just made the realization that i'm a fanboy for <propmale> & the chipmunks  i'm currently in the process of hording all things related to them  i'll let you know how that goes   
i want a refund on my life   
"\well maybe you need to start being the right guy  that's why you got punched out  'cause you got the wrong attitude right outta the gate \"" - yes man"""

"have you heard? thunder bay theater is having it's last show of the summer season! \the 25th annual putnam county spelling bee\""  so be there or be s-q-u-a-r-e!!!"""
"come and see \spelling bee\"" in it's final week of production   i'd be e-c-s-t-a-t-i-c if you did!"""
"just so you know, i'm not the woman in my profile pic "
"\everybody's got the right to be happy \"" so come see assassins over at thunder bay theater!"""
"if you really knew me, you would know how paranoid i really am "
"i wish i could have what i want  that my dreams would come true  that everything would work out \\i also wish i wasn't so depressed sounding "
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish for 2011 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but acceptance and equal rights  93% won't copy and paste this  will you make it your status for at least one hour?
funny how your mood can go from happy and bubbly to sad and depressed in so little time   
"best comment ever: \if [wal-mart] put in a coffee or real bar they would own the town \"""""
<propfemale>!
"click the \like\"" button if i have ever made you smile  then set this as your status and see how many people you have made smile smile """
just played on the x-box kinect  it's a blast!
2010 is almost over! so inbox me something you always wanted to tell me  it will stay between us  post this as your status & see what you get!
"step, together, step, together  the kinect game dance central thinks that i don't know how to mirror someone on a tv, so it tells me exactly what to do  lol"
so no one told you life was gonna be this way
"zadok the priest, and <propmale> the prophet anointed <propmale> <propmale> "
i'm a stitch away from making it
agrees with <propfemale> laub 
"\i like this show    let's invite the audience \"""""

asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you love has or had cancer  my prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found  will you post it? just one hour  do it for all of us in memory of too many to mention and in honor of all fighting it!!

"finally got through my friends list like i've been meaning to  if you made it, good for you  if you didn't and you can read this message, then drop me a line and convince me i'm wrong for de-friending you "
"getting ready for our opening night of guys on ice  come see the show, it's a real hum dinger!"

"the age old question    \what am i going to do until the next thing i have to do?\"""""

"if you love me; comment on this status\if you think i'm good friend; like this status\if you ever had a crush on me; poke me\if you hate me; message me && tell me why\if your not scared post this as your status"
"so let me get this straight      larry <propmale> is on his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for a 9th time, <propfemale> spears had a 55-hour marriage, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods, while married, were having sex with everyone; and yet the idea of same-sex marriage is still going to destroy the institution of marriage? really? re-post to your <propfemale> if you agree - proud to support equal rights"
"my friend, <propfirst> walchak, just uploaded a whole slew of photos of me  i just went back and looked at all the years that have passed  i have really changed "
"go to your profile  the first five people to appear on the sidebar of your friends section are on your team in the upcoming zombie apocalypse  how screwed are you?\\<propfirst> link, <propmale> mcguire, <propfemale> ouellette, <propfirst> beck, and <propfirst> hilton \\i think that <propfirst> and i could hold off the zombies long enough for us to find a shelter "
"i have something really fun to do  post a story of how we met  it could be true or not  if you think someone else's story is true, 'like' it  if you think it's false, comment on it "
"if you have a wonderful man who helps balance your whole world, who isn't perfect, but perfect for you, who works hard & would do anything for you, who makes you laugh & drives you crazy, who is your best friend, who takes care of you, who you want to grow old with, who you are thankful for everyday & who you could not live without, then brag on him a little & re-post "
