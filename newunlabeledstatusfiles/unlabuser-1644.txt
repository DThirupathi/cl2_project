#514 ~ when i first met you i thought you looked like <propfemale> (what can i say i'm visual) i love your sense of style and your words of wisdom    even if you don't remember saying them  you know how to have a good time and can make me genuinely laugh out loud!
#143~ when i first saw you i was mesmerized by your booty (again i am visual) just couldn't figure out where it came from your so small everywhere else? i got to know you and by far the best thing you ever said was 'oh no we are nothing alike' rofl! i love that you are stuck up but not behind peoples backs you are quick to tell who ever it is whatever it is you want to say to them! not many people do that anymore 
#102 ~ the thing i remember most about you is when you cut your finger off in the hmmwv fan!!! thats funny now right??? *giggles*
#3~ i think you have been dealt a hard hand and do the best you can with it  bless your heart and whenever you get down look at your angels and remember your making a difference to them and everyone else can fuck off!
"#023 ~ you may not know it but you have been huge influence in my life, whenever someone says that i can't do something i think of you and not only do it    but do it the best  i don't have enough characters to thank you for all you did to build my character, self esteem, education, to let go of excuses  i am glad i could do such a small favor in return  *hugs* love ya"
#26 5~ though we are very different we are very much the same  we have faced challenges and tragedies nearly from birth and i am glad you made it through those very early ones  your talent and sarcasm is amazing and i often daydream about sending letters to bands or oprah or something because i think more people should e playful erience you  thank you for everything you do there really isn't a price you can put on it 
"#412~ the leopard dress you wore to one of the high school dances i still dream of it  smile   i always thought you were a sweet and innocent girl (i found out later on facebook or myspace that a few locker rooms thought otherwise!!) that you were a popular girl! your laugh and smile always lit up my day, and the slap on the ass at our reunion was a treat! *hugs*"
this <propfirst> thing really is an eye opener! you learn things you really didn't know  i am blessed to have such wonderful people in my life  love you all!
#8675309~ you have both fabulous boobs and an amazing smile and i still owe you head! had it not been for you i would probably still be in afghanistan hoping to get a flight out one day! i only knew you very briefly and hope our paths cross again because you truly are a joy!
"#09366 ~ ultimate definition of a lady in the street and a freak in the bed   i am glad i could help you find that special place  wink  hope he's still not mad about that! i love that you do things the right way even if right is the most difficult nearly impossible path  i pray you find the balance between the freak in you and the rest of your life, cause to lose the freak would be a pity "
#005 ~ my oh my grape soju and the fact that you nearly killed me the first night i ever <propmale> out with you  i would write more of that night but i can't seem to remember past <propfemale>'s bathroom till about 430 am! always lots of fun with lots of music and a great dancer! and married more than me!!!!
