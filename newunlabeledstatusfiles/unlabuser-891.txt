"why does the mofo at the gym, playing his music out loud on his cell phone always have to get on the treadmill right next to me and try to talk to me while i am clearly listening to my ipod and while i'm clearly not interested in anything he has to say? stfu!"
is a total grump right now    calling it an effing night 
narf!
de-stressing with some friends and a few bottles of wine  happy friday to me!
"apparently if you drink 2 bottles of wine in about 3 hours, when you wake up in the morning, you will still be drunk "
?let's run away and don't ever look back   ?
i was really not feelin' the gym today    somehow pushed through it  chilling while i rehydrate and while watching the kardashians gives me a complex 
i wish i could be indifferent 
"my bed is so comfortable, it should be illegal "
"i don't want to buy new winter clothes, i just want my old ones to shrink!!!"
?ever wonder what put that thunder deep behind my eyes? take a look and you'll find the sunshine ?
catching up on jersey shore  are there any men who genuinely respect women?
spending the rest of this beautiful weekend in beautiful fair haven!
fishing with dad and <propfemale>  i need some aloe <propfemale>    my skin hurts 
"today my dad told me that i would be a good wife for a man because i'm quiet and i don't nag  damn, i could have been barefoot and pregnant a loooong time ago if i knew the bar had been set so low  p s  i am so glad to be home!!!"
"because i'm easy come, easy go\little high, little low\any way the wind blows\doesn't really matter to me "
i'm a procrastinator-tater! i need to get to the gym  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh okay i'm going now 
change is the only constant in life 
we can only appreciate the miracle of a sunrise if we have waited in the darkness 
officially on vacation till the 14th  kickin' it off the right way with some shopping 
nothing sucks more than running out of pickles 
strawberry daqueries just might be the death of me     fyi 
"i def feel like i could lay in bed all day but i guess i'm going to spend some time at my sisters new house in the boonies  if you're trying to get ahold of me, i won't have service cuz at&t sucks "
"curling up with some tortillas and pineapple salsa, joy behar and to top it off: no work tomorrow  life is fabulous!"
?yeah i'm bright but i don't give a fuck if you see me?
got my butt kicked at the gym tonight (thanks to miss  <propfemale>)  now it's just me and a bowl of strawberries and they're playing strangers with <propfemale> on logo now! worrrd 
"cleaning and errands all day, gonna try to slip some pampering in there some where    mani pedi anyone??"
i just want it all 
i hate when you're really hungry but nothing sounds good so you sample a little of everything    and then you feel like total crap  so that was my night in a nutshell  but now i'm gonna catch up on always <propfemale> and probably order a snuggie  good times 
getting ready to hit the town with my people  apologies ahead of time for any drunk texting that may occur  smile 
i am sparkling!!!!! lol 
i am soooo craving homemade chili and cornbread right now !!!
"wow, i really hate maroon 5  puke "
"watching the vma's, go gaga?"
my birthday is exactly 2 weeks from today  i think i can hear garcia's calling my name   
"back to work after having a long, amazing week off  sleep is so much better than work "
am i too old to go to bed this early? i'm so sleepy  annoyed 
"lend me your eyes, i can change what you see "
"half pumpkin spice cappuccino and half coffee, yum!"
snug as a bug in a rug  smile 
dragging my be-hind outta bed to work 10-9 at good ol' supportives  i  love  overtime 
what a gorgeous day  makes me wanna go apple picking!
got my hair sexified (more blond) and then got into one of those strange cleaning moods so i got a lot done  now i'm settling into bed with a good book 
i guess that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano   
"i need a massage like, pronto "
wondering why i go out of my way to make myself absolutely crazy 
blasting some music and finishing up some cleaning    then winding from my pre-birthday bash weekend  i love my friends and family! ?
thanks to everyone who took a second yesterday to wish me a happy birthday! much appreciated  love 
finally heading to the gym    totally dvring glee!
life is such a trip 
"\you're mean but you're my favorite \"""""
"not settling for anything less than fabulous, amazing and incredible  period "
this is the best sleeping weather i've encountered in a while 
training all day in the lovely rochester with my msc pals!
super bored 
i ? the dollar tree 
"well hello there, moment of clarity "
are there any other negative consequences to not turning my heat on yet- other than me freezing my toes off? i just want to put off getting raped by nyseg for as along as possible 
"since my stupid landlords won't answer their phones maybe someone here can help me    when i turn on my gas heater in my living room, the carbon monoxide detector goes off  when i turn off the heater, the detector chirps for a while and then stops  i have lived here for almost a year and this has never happened    insight?"
respect is the minimum 
i wish i had a dull moment  good news: no work 'till about 11 tomorrow  anything going on this beautiful afternoon?
could it be any more gorgeous today?
waking up early on a satuday just seems unnatural  wpeking at beautiful pine city for a bit and then dragging myself to the gym 
heading out the night  smile 
had a great night last night with the best people in the world ? taking some time to relax and recover 
re-watching the <propfemale> episode of glee  this season is not disappointing at all! they totally need to do a <propfemale> episode next season   
didn't wear a stitch of makeup today (not even foundation!) i don't think i've done that since i was 13  damn it feels good to be a gangsta!
ahhh i freaking love the weekend!!!!!
doin' some ot at burkeshire 12-8 smile 0 and then coming home to snuggle up in bed cuz it's gettin' soooooo cold!!!!!
boom
that show eastbound & down is messed up  i'm pretty sure i love it 
i can't stand parents who screamingly humiliate their children in public  i wonder if their children turn out to be obnoxious assholes just like their parents   
i am so worth it 
"i need a truckload of wine, on the double!"
watching the hangover on hbo  hehehehe
it's gonna be so gorgeous out today  i wanna do something fun!!!!
it's just been one of those days  sad 
"drinking wine and thinking bliss, is on the other side of this\\i just need a compass and a willing accomplice\\all my doubts that fill my head cascading up and down again\\up and down and round again, down and up and down again \\oh, i've had my chances and i've taken them all \\just to end up right back here on the floor "
training in canandaigua all day  left my phone in <propfemale>  hello torture!
my cat is eating his own whisker that just fell out of his face  he's my little genius  smile 
two more days till a bitch can get drunk!!! woo! and i need it so badly   
what a crazy day  long story short: i'm in albany for work until early saturday afternoon  now i'm gonna attempt to fall asleep    night  smile 
"what a weekend, it went by wayyy too fast! i'm finally settling in at home, for the first time since wednesday, getting some chores done around the house  i can't believe tomorrow is monday already    i am so not ready for it!!!"
i see so much love for such a truly wonderful man as i scroll down my facebook <propfemale>  i'm still in such disbelief but i'm taking some time to surround myself with the family and friends who loved him so much  thank you all for your thoughts and support in this incredibly difficult time 
"<propmale>'s viewing and service will be held at the southport fire department from 4-7 pm on saturday, november 6th "
i sincerely believe that i have the greatest friends anyone could ask for    ? i am so grateful for you all ?
"what moves through us is a silence, a quiet sadness, a longing for one \more day, one more word, one more touch, we may not understand why you \left this earth so soon, or why you left before we were ready to say \good-bye, but little by little, we begin to remember not just that you \died, but that you lived  and that your life gave us memories too \beautiful to forget  ?"
"candles lit, music on, lights out= chill time "
no work tomorrow  now that's the most fabulous thing i've heard in ages 
beef's  smile 
"if you can't control yourself enough to not hock loogies into your hand and wipe them on your pants while you're on the treadmill, do us a favor and don't come to the gym  take a sudafed and call it a day you freaking sicko!"
all i wanna do is nothing  sad 
that 2 hour nap was a poor choice  now i'm never gonna fall asleep!
it's p-j tiiiiime!!!!
"all day\\staring at the ceiling\\making friends with shadows on my wall\\all night\\hearing voices telling me\\that i should get some sleep\\because tomorrow might be good for something   "

i suppose it's bed time    trying zumba tomorrow morning!
"i officially ? zumba  so i am jumping in the shower, hopefully getting some things done around this place and then heading out to <propfemale>! and then   "
