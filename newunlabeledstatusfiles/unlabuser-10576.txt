they wanted mr  <propfirst> to perform dis week but i had to turn em down    got too much goin on
less than a week now till gametime
the night jus flyin by
i'm aint got the biggest roar among the lions    but to my respect you wont be defiant cp- <propfirst> lyrics
"its true that \yesterday was years ago    a lifetime ago\""- somebody"""
adios amigos
i hope im not out for too long    fina get x-rayed
dat gonnit!!!!    still aint started mrs  dershem's essay
thinking bout writin a new song for the video    jus so busy
i can walk now    but say the same for runnin or jumpin
im so tired my body shakin    only got like 4hrs of sleep
fb <virtroue stel >
finally out of the boot
fina go to <propmale> game to see my cousin play
we call all change the world in our own small way    all it takes is a lil courage
is chillin at da wolverines game
jus got done wit an interview wit st <propfirst> university     not really interested
jus left an interview from st <propfirst> university     dont think its for me
hard times just dont go away
if you lose a moment     you may lose alot

holy spirit dwell in me    touch my eyes that i might see
they waitin for my downfall but the <propfemale> of <propfirst> has only begun!!!!

fb <testyourmight>
she has qualities that one must notice     she makes a pro seem like a novice
well <propfemale> christmas to all     sometimes irony has a way of smacking you in the face
those who emphasize on events of the past lack preparation for events of the future
it's like their heads are full of rocks rather than brains
guess it wont be long before i hit the ol haysack
sometimes the things u dislike about someone are the things you love the most
make sure u take the time out to thank god    he's the being that pushes u forward even when u feel theres no push left
guess i better get started on this anat  & phys  essay
finally fina head back to texas well in over 4 hours
alrite now once again     texas here i come smile 
got pulled over yesterday     guess u can get pulled over for nothin
