atheist say why didnt god creat us perfect just like him and why would he allow us to sin? answer:god cant creat us to love him because if he did we would not have true love for god  true love is a choice and not creating someone to love you  you cannot make your children love you because if you did they would not have true love for you which is out of the heart
