"i have a thought   if you ask god for something you know you will eventually get, and the big man doesnt really give you an answer, does that mean that the longer until he does, the bigger the suprise? although in retrospect, ive been praying for the same things for 4 years now, so im just going to assume that he's planning something monumental   supermodel gf and 1 mil; here's to hopeing!!"
