"today as i was navigating through the 10,000's upon 100,000's of wall posts and comments spilling from every webpage  i began to wonder just how many people realize that all of this stuff never goes away even if you delete it   all those adorable drunken wall posts & incriminating photos of you partying it up when you're supposed to be out sick never goes away they exist in some shape or form on the internet forever "
