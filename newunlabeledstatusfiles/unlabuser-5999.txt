well tonight was fun  that was my first e playful erience with cosmic bowling and it was entertaining 
"this is a picture from when i was a baby and my last name was pickles  they made a show about it, but changed my face, they thought my face was too mature for the young audience "
this is the fake me who goes around telling blasphemous tales to religious hobos during the night   he is a real pain

"i like snow days, but i have a feeling the teachers are going to try to cram stuff in this week and make these last three days very difficult   "
well it won't feel like i am really on break until i get this foolish government project finished   so i hope to start it monday
"i had a good day today  i went to the cavs game and they won, had great seats too  then i went cosmic bowling, then came home and played ps3 "
well i started the government project and it takes a lot of time  it took me a couple hours and i only got three of them done  it sucks
"working on my government project, this is a very annoying project"
"finally i am just about done with the government project, it took a few days, but i can finally be free from the stress "
i am finally done with the government project  that took way longer than three hours 
i do not want to go to school tomorrow at all   
"if i ever ride an elephant backwards down railroad tracks on a sunday afternoon in the middle of march in a winter coat while holding hot chocolate, i would be pretty sure i lost my mind, until then i am perfectly sane"
i want the weekend to be here already
"if i wasn't in school anymore and had my driver's license and permission, i would so be on my way to new york city for tomorrow"

"i think it would be quite relaxing to be this giant duck calmly drifting down the english channel with no one to bother me, just going where the tide takes me"
tbh
