education is one of the most precious things you can give a child 
"lead me by your truth and teach me, for you are the god who saves me  all day long i put my hope in you "
"may the master pour on the love so it fills your lives and splashes over on everyone around you     may you be infused with strength and purity, filled with confidence in the presence of god our father â€¦â€�"
"whether we speak to others or serve them, we should always consider if we are praising our heavenly father! it's not about us!!"
all difficulties can be overcome if you have true faith in him!!!

"life here on earth is a journey  it is filled with ups and downs, happiness and sorrows, challenges and success  this is to test our faith and conviction, to put our hope and trust on our almighty lord, who is always there to guide us   till we reach the end of our journey--our salvation "

let's fill ourselves up with christ today
is  annoyed 
"we go through life so often not stopping to enjoy the day,and we take each one for granted as we travel on our way we never stop to measure anything we just might miss, but if the wind should blow by softly you'll feel an angel's kiss "
"tgif - today god is first! be sure to give him the <propfemale> for getting you through another week at work  by putting him first, you will have the incredible satisfaction of having walked in a manner \worthy of the calling with which you have been called!\"""""
"did you ever walk into a room and forget why you walked in? also, is wondering in elementary school, in case of fire you have to line up quietly in a single file line from smallest to tallest  what is the logic? do tall people burn slower?"
 smile 
"is really down, confused, and doesn't know how to feel right now   "
is having one fun night    smile 
is alittle bored  
"if in the course of the day you get stressed out and feel like you have no place to turn, think again! turn to the lord  bless his name! remember, he is god  praise him  it will be noticeable to your company's leaders and those around you that you are driven by something much more powerful than the stress factors that seem to drive everyone else "
loves how it feels outside  smile 
is going out   
hates this cough   
love's the song :what faith can do: by kutless
"is going out to a club    wow   no, seriously  i am  "
alittle tired today   i can't imagine why    smile 
"â€œmay the god who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow christ jesus, so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ â€� (romans 15:5-6)"
wants to bundle up in a blanket and sleep   
"just when you think it can't get worse, it does    "
"have faith in your dreams and someday your rainbow will come smiling through  no matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep believing, the dream that you wish will come true â€�"
"keep on asking, and you will be given what you ask for  keep on looking, and you will find  keep on knocking, and the door will be opened  for everyone who asks, receives  everyone who seeks, finds  and the door is opened to everyone who knocks  <propfirst> 7:7-8"
"â€œlife lives, life dies  life laughs, life cries  life gives up and life tries  but life looks different through everyone's eyes â€�"
had fun last night    
is registered for classes   smile 
is blowing bubbles   
my <propmale> class was cancelled  sad  guess i'll go with political science instead   
isn't feeling very well   
is in her singing mood   lalala
needs to really relax and destress   
is glued to the couch  um literally 
happy thanksgiving     gobble gobble
is full from all the turkey   
is really trying to stay away from the thousands of chocolate chip cookies in her freezer   ahhhh cookie dough is soooo good   mmmmm
is exhausted    
loved the parade and lights in <propmale> city  
stay focused by keeping christ first in everything you do! don't try to do anything by yourself  use the power of the holy spirit to advance his kingdom!
"a true friend understands your past, believes in your future & accepts you today just the way you are "
"through persistence, self-knowledge, prayer, commitment, optimism, a resolute trust in god and the building of your own personal moral strength, you can enjoy the blessings of a deeper faith and face the difficulties of life with courage and confidence "
blessed are they who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing 
is in fort worth till sunday   
is back home where it's warm   yay
"courage, sacrifice, determination, commitment, toughness,heart, talent, guts  that's what girls are made of; the heck with sugar and spice "
how fast is a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter 
resolve to trust the lord in 2010  allow him to be your main focus in your workplace as well as in your every day life 
can not seem to stop smiling     smile  god is amazing    
i pray that 2010 will bring each of us a little closer christ  happy new year!!
"where the spirit of the lord is, there is freedom "
have faith and let the holy spirit fill your heart with his love  nothing can satisfy like the love of our father!
is so stressed with utsa and hopes to get everything squared away with fiscal services   
"so much to do, so much to do    i move to utsa 2mrw  ahhh, but yay    "
is on campus    
     
"today, you should celebrate what an unbelievable life you have had so far: the accomplishments, the many blessings, and, yes, even the hardships because they have served to make you stronger "
got about an hour and a half of sleep and is off to class    
first day of school went well  it's been a long day and isn't over yet  just can't seem to get myself to eat or sleep either  annoyed 
"love is either unconditional or it's no love  you might like someone conditional on their  personality or behavior or circumstances  but love accepts no boundaries  so never say 'i love you because', for love has no cause, love comes from god "
"\be still and know i am here \"""""
really hopes she can find a job on campus    annoyed 
does not recommend jumping on the bed if your tall     smile 
why is my printer printing??? i didn't tell it too    ahhh
"i am with you always, even to the end of the age"
it's in the time of unknowing that having faith is what sees you through  to the other side  faith is what gives you strength  faith is that light in your  heart that keeps on shining even when it's all darkness outside  now is the time  to keep that faith alive!
"you keep wanting to know how things will play out, keep asking to see the future  god doesn't give anyone the power to know the future, because life becomes maddeningly boring when you know everything upfront  so, instead of struggling, enjoy the uncertainty - to be alive means to not know "
fell off the bed laughing so hard   
be still and know i am here   
"do your very best today and may god bless your hard work, your honesty, and your integrity   there is great peace knowing that you never have to look over your shoulder to see if anyone is going to â€œcatchâ€� you!  you are â€œworking for christâ€� wherever you are and others are finding him as a result of your witness!"
stress fracture in my foot  sad  not fun  
its all rainy and yucky outside today    its a good day for studying     smile 
algebra test 2mrw    
is soooo sore    it feels great   
"it's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives "
the most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart 
"so what if a new line of cereal came out; hammios, pork loops, mice krispies, frosted bacon flakes,scrapple jacks, and <propfemale> bunches of goats?"
"people don't just fall in love everyday  in most cases, we're so caught up in preconcieved notions about what love is & what it should feel like & act like & look like, that when we finally have it in our midst, we're blind to it until it's too late & it's slipped through our fingers   "
"take a risk, take a <propmale>, make a change, and breakaway   "
que hora es???
     
the greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do and seriously how many roads must a man walk down before he admits hes lost?
your undying faith is what keeps the flame of love alive
?(â€¢???â€¢?)? ?(-???-?)? ?(????â€¢?)?
