a new reason to buy the new pokemon  one is a 2 scoop ice cream cone 
"wow, i was actually awake for the northern japan earthquake    "
"if my cat was a pokemon, it could learn tackle, growl, tail whip, scratch, bite, stockpile and spit-up "
how do you do it? make me feel like i do 
"kiefer march died     i can't believe it  i haven't had a class with him since 8th grade, but in 8th grade, i remember the times we had  i'll miss you man   "
what is the better cartoon animal friend? <propfirst> from spongebob or porkchop from <propmale>?
"well, it's no longer friday "
i realized looking like a dirty hipster is too mainstream  so i shaved off all of my facial hair except for my goatee 
i wish there was another pokemon event  sad 
"ride on, shooting <propfemale>  fly on, albatross "
bought fooly cooly 
i'm sorry primus for removing all of your albums from my computer  it's not that i don't like you  it's that i can never find the mood in which i want to listen to you 
just watched dead leaves  only those who love insanity will enjoy  laugh 
happy 15th anniversary biohazard!
