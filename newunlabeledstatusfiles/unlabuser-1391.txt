"is grateful for her parents  this is what i have come to believe    children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older, they judge them; when they have children of their own, they beg them to remove the curse   smile "
"it's not only children who grow   parents do too   as much as we watch to see what our children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what we do with ours   i can't tell my children to reach for the sun   all i can do is reach for it, myself   ~joyce <propmale>"
