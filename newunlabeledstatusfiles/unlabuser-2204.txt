i m free now  wink  mentally & physically   
"england rocks\easing it 4 us somehow   "
"just the kiwis to go\they must show their loyality streak    "
"ithe rakh    \cha gye ne tha ker k     "
hor khedo ipl      wink 
"we just lost to fate , , , ,well played pakistan\fight kr k haare hain , , ,koi na fer sai,,,"
rise & rise again until lambs become lions    
"j tu akhiya de saamne ni rehna te beeba saada dil mor de , , , , , "
what u r looking at is the walk of a man who just lost everything    
i love saqlain <propmale>

o sohni tenu chand ki mein choori pehnawaan
"very happy in my heart ,,, dil dance maare re  wink "
something is missing      sad 
"in aankhon ki masti mein ,,,  wink "
"happy new year everybody ,,,"
