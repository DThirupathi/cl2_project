i tried very hard not to lose it while spending all the time coming up with millions of excuses and i thought i came up with every possibility but in the end i will always be depressed 
"i guess im that guy that knows he isn't perfect but still tries to be, the guy who looks into her eyes and knows there won't be a better person so just gives up, and i am the guy who is happy and sad at the same time, sad because its not me making her happy, but happy because i love here enough to want her to be happy  annoyed "

"i am lonely because i'm an invisible person  i'm a person of substance, flesh and bone and i might even be said to possess a mind  i'm invisible because people refuse to see me  they see only what they want to, what makes them happy and secure but in reality there is rarely true happiness and security this may open your eyes, to the truth, to the real world, not what your mind wants to see, but what you mind needs to"
my exam got rescheduled for the past 3 weeks !!!!!!!!!!!1
"i asked her to talk, and she hesitated  we looked into each others eyes and i started  i told her how much i care about her and how she is constantly on my mind and how i needed to know what her feelings for me are  after forcing my self not to tear or show much emotions the conversation was over  we were friends in the past, we are friends now, and in the future that is all we will ever be and i need to accept it "
"i will always be right beside you until the very end, wiping your tears because i am your friend, i will smile because you smile, i will feel the pain you do ,and if you shed a tear i promise to shed one too just because we are just friends "
"my heart got ripped out by you and all you did was tear it, crush it and step all over it     oh but what is this my heart is still beating    now what?  crying "

"i know that we are just friends, and you have no interest in me, but i still hope that in the future you and i will get closer and you would always come to me when your sad and need someone to hold you, and one day when we are alone in a moment of weakness and loneliness, you'll give in, and both of us will be happy"
