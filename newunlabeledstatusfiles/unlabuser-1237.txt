"so, epic match i we had today  sure wish i would've played!!!"
district champ 2-years straight!! woot!!!
tomorrow is going to be a long day   
"so waking up at 8 yesterday morning, 2 2-hour tennis matches, rushing to get ready for prom, getting like 3 and 1 2 hours of sleep to wake up at seven this morning, then another 3 2-hour tennis matches= me being epically tired and sore    everything caught up eventually     sad "
so today was full of disappointments    hope tomorrow goes better 
finally back to school tomorrow    not looking forward to it     sad 
so i never relized how many things i eat with cheese until it got to the point where i can't eat it     sad 
"so today was pretty bad  like yesterday but, worse  because today my stomach is in pain    sad day   "
"so, i officially hate living in forney     sad "
bored out of my mind    as usual

so my phone wanted to be retarded and not let me text or call anybody for the last 30 minutes    i hate my phone         
so bored 
"is saying good-bye to soda, for a while anyway "
first full day in forever that i haven't had a soda  i am so proud of myself   but yet i can't help think of why i did this in the first place   
day 3 of no soda    look at me go!!!
today was a good day  burned my face though    sunscreen would have helped  oh well
great!! english paper due tomorrow    too bad i'm still gonna procrastinate (and by that i mean not doing it at all)   
well that honors thing was interesting   
finally things are not happening every single day  starting tomorrow that is   
so the last day of b day tennis was great  played for about 30 seconds    had to sit inside for like 30 minutes    and got to go home early! what a day!!!
so i'm up to slide 65 for my powerpoint    sad day 
there has been a fly flying around my head for the past hour and it won't leave  i swear!! it waits for me to type!!
going to play for the <propfirst> coach on friday!! hopefully i am good enough to reserve a spot on the team for myself      annoyed 
tomorrow is the time to crank things up a couple notches!! go from beast    to mega beast mode!! haha
so i'm really tired from last night  but i don't want to sit in and do nothing tonight  need to do something    
it's surprising how much one day can change your whole perspective of everything  yesterday made a huge difference   
last day was pretty boring 
"fun, fun!!! about to get ready for the graduation practice!! haha, yea right     annoyed "
time for he rest of my life   
not as sore as i thought i would be from yesterday 
"so playing tennis today kinda made me feel like a failure  well, all except my serves that is   "

april downing is so lucky i am such a good friend  i actually had to take notes and pay attention in history for the first time   
think of the greatest feeling you've ever had  the one that words cannot describe  that's how i feel right now after roulan fornelius ceniza and i played the best tennis of our lives!
"just pulled the best move ever!! i was out front with some taco <propfemale> in my hands then started searching my pockets for my card key to open the door  \then this black guy came up and said did you forget your key \i said i think so   \as he was opening the door for me, i found it hanging around my neck   \ annoyed "
i am wondering why so many people think ?ric <propfirst> hamface and i look like brothers   
"maybe if it wasn't raining so hard, my only pair of shoes wouldn't have drown in a puddle    in the middle of the street   "
why am i so fat??

so the same spot on the back of my hand has been itching for aboot 6 or so hours    it's driving me crazy!
i just now realized that i am constantly rubbing the back of my head because my hair-cut 
it's all about the alarm clock going off after it was unplugged while the power is out 
creo que es hora para mÃ­ de aprender espaÃ±ol para que yo pueda entender lo que la mitad <propmale> equipo siempre estÃ¡ hablando  (i hope this is right   )
snowing pretty hardcore outside! i hope this makes the school get canceled tomorrow!
"another interesting night with <propfirst> <propfirst> hamel, roulan fornelius ceniza, and me! movies that make no sence ftw!"
wishing i was still asleep right now   
"funny how doing the same things here gets old, but while doing the same things in mesquite never does   "

"gotta love college  i left my backpack in the cafeteria for 1 1 2 hours, then went back and got it  the best part    it didn't get moved at all "
i love it when i get these random jolts of confidence for tennis  but    this is usually about the time that i will get injured in some way  hmmm     annoyed 
i feel like my shoulder will implode if i make a wrong move   
oh yea!! time to start that 4-5 <propfemale> history paper that is due tonight! i have procrastinated long enough 
"ahhhh    2 pages down, hopefully just 2 to go! why is history so uninteresting?"
"after 3 weeks of suffering with no way to drive myself around, i finally got my truck back!!! i am very happy faced right now!  laugh "
"\you don't need a measuring cup for ramen noodles!\""\",1916da6cbfb401b2ab48b2ac07a55de3,"don't you just love the times when you get back to your room and there is a whataburger cup in your trash, and the sweet tea that was in it, is all over your floor and filling the bottom of your trash can? > sad "
so    my project is due at 8 smile 0 in the morning  i think i have procrastinated enough  time to get started   annoyed 
so my computer wont start up    i guess i will be doing my homework right here in the tennis class room  
so i borrowed this computer to do homework and somehow     i ended up on facebook 
"just when i thought life couldn't hate me more    my truck didn't get fixed properly, so i am afraid to drive it \lost my confidence in my truck and i lost the use of my computer   what else could go wrong?"
i am so glad that i could make <propfemale> leitz and <propfemale> saldana laugh while i was desperately looking for some bread 
i love it when the dumbest of things make me wanna destroy everything!! this stupid treadmill does not want to be put together!! daahhhhh!!  crying

"if you are looking to vote for <propfirst> <propmale>, he is no longer at <propfemale> 29  he is on <propfemale> 30 at rank 14!! keep voting to keep him there "
we are all praying for you kiefer 
last nights trip back to <propfirst> seemed like the longest trip i have ever been on  still praying for you kiefer  r i p 
i feel as though it is a little easier knowing that they found you kiefer  r i p 
"so i am completely zoned out of things this week because i have walked into the same branch, that hit me in the face, 3 times in 3 days   "

i love it when i set my food on the table and then try to sit down but my seat slides out from under me and i fall to the ground 
played some pretty sick tennis today  even more sore now than i started off at the beginning of the day   sad 
there goes my roommate and his singing <propfirst> beiber songs again    *mega sigh*
"so after stringing 5 tennis rackets, helping <propfirst> <propfirst> hamel with his introduction paragraph, and being tired   i am going to bed  9"
on the bright side of life   i finally used the ' com' button on my phone for something   laugh 
who finally got their computer back?? this guy!!!
so i am pretty sure i just broke my middle finger  stupid football!!
i am <propfemale> bored right now  it's like you don't even know!!
