"yesterday we had a great time visiting the american museum of natural history again   we've even become members   we looked at a lot of different types of shells, saw more of the hall of human origins (we're about half way through that one), and an imax movie on the great lakes   then we ate at a nice restaurant, <propfemale>'s, since we had to wait for a wheelchair cab "
"<propfemale> is being admitted to the hospital again for a biopsy tomorrow   it looks as though she may be having another episode of liver rejection   it's an uncomfortable hassle, and it means we'll be in new york longer, but we e playful ect with treatment she'll be better soon "
"<propfemale> will be at mt  sinai hospital here in nyc for 7 days while they treat her with high doses of immunosuppressants   as julane says, this is not unusual after a transplant   it's snowing here!"
"in answer to <propfemale>'s question, <propfemale>'s spirits are up and down   she very much wants to be back in texas with her friends and life there   news of delays is upsetting, but she adjusts pretty quickly   the prednisone she's taking to prevent organ rejection plays havoc with her moods "
"in further answer to <propfemale>'s question, i'm usually fine   we both enjoy new york   the thing that helps <propfemale> the most is distractions   there are fun things to do in the hospital since she's in a pediatric section   when she's out of the hospital, there are many good opportunities for distraction "
"thanks everyone for your thoughts, wishes, and prayers "
<propfemale> was released from the hospital yesterday evening   we are back at the transplant living center and she is doing fine 
thanks for the birthay wishes!  i feel lucky to have such thoughtful friends   it was great to celebrate with my family back together in <propfirst> 
leaving for san <propmale> this a m
