"are you with someone tonight? do not question your love  take your lover by the hand  release the power within yourself  your heard me, release the power  tame the wild cosmos with a whisper  conquer heaven with one intimate caress  that's right don't be shy  whip out everything you got and do it in the butt  by <propfirst> phelps"
