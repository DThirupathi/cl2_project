"ok so maybe wearing the black pants, black shirt, and black hat to church in the 100 degree weather wasn't the best idea   but at least i looked good "
"wore all black again today; an because it had to be, the temp was around 490  you think i'd learn after a while   "
why is it that when i'm trying to think of something to do in this town i get nothing?    this is no not new york

mindless crap being posted on my <propfemale> makes me want to kill in the thousands!! hahaha   i need help   
reminisce:
an orangutan grows to a height of 5ft but will have an arm span of 7ft    that means he can be stanfing a full <propfirst> away from you and still backhand you lol

"ugh    stomach hurts     nothing new i guess, but still pain gets annoying after a while you know "
ok people  i'm gonna play guitar hero  so if i don't respond it's not that i don't see you; it's because i'm ignoring you! (unless you say something funny)
i hate when i'm playing guitar hero and i miss like one note in a string of notes    but you know what's worse  getting interrupted when playing guitar hero   
"man: yeah officer and before i knew what was happening he put a gun to my head  officer: man, you know exactly what happened  one: you live in texas  and two: you slept with his wife  you'd just better be glad she called us before he got there    (just another day in the life of a texan right)"
what was with my last post? that was weird  guess that's what happens when i update facebook while i'm still waking up
    the game (gah i lost)
good day today  i keep wondering how we manage to talk so long lol
"i might ignore you, and i'm not sorry for it  you're cutting into my time with hina babar"
are we supposed to live our lives striving to reach our final goals and ultimate happiness only to have them crushed under the weight of our own death? please; we have religion to fix that  -a man long since dead
"\it is so stupid that they get on girls about wearing short skirts but when you look at the cheerleading skirt and it's even shorter than anything else! look at that! my boxers are longer than that skirt! *stands up* you know what? i'm gonna take off my pants! and i shouldn't get any crap about it because my underwear is longer than that skirt\"" -najee binns"""

"so the black pants, black shirt, black shoes, and black boxers wasn't a good idea  well at least i've got white socks on   "
"so today was great  i taught my little brother how to skate  he catches on well, like very well  he's smart, smarter than i though he was  not that i thought he was dumb of course, he's a binns lol  he's just at the level i hoped he would be at though  god i love that kid  i love you <propmale>, don't ever forget that  love "
never empty your pockets on the train  you never know when there's going to be a random zombie attack and you'll need your ammo
funny how no one will admit to watching blues clues but everyone will say how they like the old guy better than the new guy
"it's my brother's 7th birthday today  he's growing up fast  i don't even remember some of those earlier years  i'll have to make sure i'm in his life more from now on  i love you <propmale>, happy birthday"
i'm tired of people involving themselves in my life  live your own life people or watch how i succeed without your worthless stupidity
you ever have that uncontrollable urge to rip yourself in half; or is that just me?
ugh well this has basically lost meaning
my current situation plus my bloodline misery = (ugh+ (misery^10))^2 plus more uuuuuggggghhhhhhh
hmmm now i've got myself thinking   i wonder how many small caliber bullets can fit into a knee-cap before it finally cracks     the world may never know
"conversation after breakfast   \grandpa: (to grandma, joking) it's nice out i don't want to change out of my shorts  you got a long skirt i can put on over this?\grandma: the <propfemale> people don't call it skirts, they call it something different  and the muslims \grandpa: i ain't no <propfemale> and i ain't no muslim   i'm a nigga \najee: (has a mini-spaz attack while pouring apple juice, tries not to laugh   ultimately fails)"
oh that is truly upsettig

"\oh najee  you're just a big emotional <propmale> bear; every once and a while you need a hug to set you straight\"" -k  knight   i'm gonna kill this guy"""
"true boredom, i've been reduced to quizzes   "

"crap formal re-takes are tomorrow; that's why i was going to wash clothes this weekend  wel najee's going to have to look good on the fly, like always"
today was the second time someone seriously asked me if i had a multiple-personality disorder  and even though i've been living this way for more than 8 years i realized i truly don't know how to answer that question   hmm
that was the single most epic dream   ever       i must spread this tale  away! -runs off to tell the tale of ages-
"the other day i thought it was about time to think about my limits  upon realizing that i was already offensivly relentless, a voice inside commented that i should perhaps \grow a heart\"" for some things  then another voice said that it would rather be like this than risk becoming too weak to withstand the future  i told the first thought \""sorry i have to agree with him\""  he wasn't mad; he said \""at least you're sorry\"""""
never thought i'd say this but i can't wait for school to start back again  i'm a bit tired of doing nothing; this break turned out to be quite unproductive 
i feel like tearing my heart out of my chest and throwing it at a wall so i can yell at it properly  that little girl in my head needs to man up!
you know   even though i've been alive and being me for 17 years  i still get that sucky feeling inside when i realize that someone doesn't understand me 
"<propfemale>'s cool  she can really get in my head  go places that others can't, places that i don't want to  she's not hina, she knows that and i don't hold it over her; but this is what she's here for  it's nice actually, i finally at least have one person outside my head that i can talk to, that can help me until hina's back"
<propfemale> left to go uhh do   something  lets get distracted in something that matters now  pt starts january 
"i love that feeling of setting a new plan into motion  thanks <propfemale>, i'll take it from here "
dang i'm not even home for 3 minutes and <propfemale> already is showing me this detailed planned layout for the next like 5 months  way to go in   
anybody who slaps their knees twice before a fight is an assassin! -<propfirst> hart lol gotta love it
"so <propfemale> lied to me  pt isnt supposed to start until january  i wake up this morning, it's foggy and cold outside she says \get dressed you're going out there\"""""
"me: <propfemale> why can't i move?\<propfemale>: because your body is still worthlessly out of shape  now get up we have work to do "
well the one small plan that i had to do today just got quashed  another day sitting inside i guess 
"i've got a gift for you najee  you can sleep tonight if you want  -<propfemale>, wow thanks   "
"ok so i'm going out again, lets see if this time i can actually do what i had planned "
"the true sign of uber bordom, sitting down and liking things   "
so i'll be up the rest of the night doing this puzzle  it's gonna be fun  smile 
"today is totally devoted to taking my hair out  even <propfemale> gave me \the day off\"" because she knows how much of a project it is to get these braids out """
"apparently najee has an mri tomorrow  thats kind of a strange thing to spring up on someone  i thought it was friday, but either way im not really looking forward to it  boredom to the <propmale>"
"time to do this mri  i'd say \go hard\"" but i have to be still lol  ok i'll be done in a few hours  if you can't contact me it's because i'm still in there """
