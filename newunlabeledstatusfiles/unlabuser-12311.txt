happy new year 2011!  here's to a good year!  and another thank you for the birthday wishes!
i've been spending the past two hours friend requesting people and adding stuff to my facebook when i swore i would never get one of these     i'm out of my mind  annoyed 
i really need to get some sleep    insomnia sucks   
"in a facebook frenzy right now     what's happening to me!!!! lol  anyway, so supposedly castle age is the best game on facebook   thank you ad bar on the side thingy for informing of something so important   i'm so relieved because that was one of my most burning questions, lol   haha, i don't even know what castle age is i'm just being weird   "
"it might just save your liiiiiiiiiifffeee  that's the power of love duh nuh duh nuh nuh that's the power of love     haha whatever anyway, i'm so bored and going to practice singing again soon "
another pointless chapter done and gone   time to write a new one that doesn't involve false promises or disappointments   at least i don't care too much  laugh 
"voice is dead, can't really sing well right now and i need to practice  sad "
"just got back from the papa roach, chevelle, sevendust and buckcherry concert!  it was pretty badass but my ears are still ringing lol oh    and you all should check out my band's facebook <propfemale> by typing approaching nothing into the search bar at the top of the <propfemale>    give us some love!!"
meh    tired of feeling worthless   
great    my singing voice is officially screwed up and my throat hurts
"been drinking some water, taking some cold medicine and hoping my singing voice comes back   "
"due to structural issues because of the flood and the inability to find a new venue, the show at elm's ballroom for july 9th is no longer happening   sorry for those who wanted to attend     sad "
holy hell my head hurts  sad

"\do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away\""  one of the best lyrics ever   thank you <propmale> iglesias"""
"duffy's gig tomorrow, super nervous     just going to relax and prepare to get up at 7 am tomorrow gah   "
duffy's gig went super awesome!  really super tired    going to upload some live vids from the show and then i'm off to sleep 
"i'm waitin for the day that   \together we can find a way back   \but everything we've got at stake   \lets worry about today and put tomorrow in a bottle   \if there's some way that we can take back   \the wrong that we've created   \we can change that   \don't turn your head the other way   \\you're gonna save today    put tomorrow in a bottle   \let's put tomorrow in a bottle   awesome song!!"

"woke\up this morning to a call from my sister's number that was not my\sister  it was an indian guy yelling at me and threatening me because i\either a) kicked his dog or b) touched his daughter  i would have\asked but he told me to shut up and that he'd call the police  annoyed "
made it to 1975 in my quest to listen to every #1 on the hot 100 starting with 1940   the 70's had a lot of #1s and i still have 35 years to go until 2010    annoyed

"has\officially completed his quest to listen and rate every #1 on the hot\100 from 1940-2010  it was over 1000 songs  only five are missing\because they were old and no digital recording could be found  sad "
meh    what's on my mind?  i don't know you tell me facebook   
"whoever is calling me from a \restricted\"" number can really fucking stop   next time i get a call i'm calling the cops """

"let me introduce you ya to miss\\miss almost made it, miss understood\\miss always jaded, miss up to no good\\miss never gonna make it, miss don't know how to take it"
trust no one   that's the best thing to go by in this world 
to all:  who still considers me a friend?  be honest 
can't sleep    really need to get back into a normal sleeping pattern 
"<propfirst> your calendars, my band approaching nothing is playing at the green room in syracuse, nebraska on august 21, 2010 at 8 pm!"

"just finished the song \take a little bit\"" for my \""nonsense\"" project   check it out """
"it's nice that a call that was blatantly not roughing the passer is the decider in a close game nebraska should've won   isn't it fishy that the refs called 16 penalties on us and only 2 on texas a&m   i think they are a bit sour about us leaving the big 12, huh?"
"my band is on 104 1 the blaze tonight with their song \why you love me\""!  you can live stream online at kibz com or just tune in """

"#173:  i think you are talented and should pursue those talents   you have the ability to do it  smile \bloo:  we've been friends for a very long time and i think it is funny how we were always in classes in high school together   our friendship was rigged from the start and i miss you alot since you moved  sad "
"#696:  you are like a brother to me, that's obvious   we may not get along half the time but i'm almost certain that if i needed you there for something that you'd figure out a way   i wish we <propmale> out more \#69120:  you are one of my closest friends and we pretty much only text   you believe in me and have faith i can do things   not to mention you are a great friend   i wish i could return the favor "
"#74215:  not really sure where we stood in high school but you seem to be a cool person and i don't know why we never got along \#1297:  you are a neighbor, kind of ish and i apologize for not stopping by to see you more considering we live like two houses away   it seems like you have some tough things going on but you seem to be there to see if i'm okay and i appreciate it "
i hate that feeling that you are getting somewhere and you are further than when you started 
wow 
"so who is going to my band approaching nothing's show tomorrow?  and if you forgot, you should come to duffy's at 6 pm tomorrow and watch approaching nothing and my friend <propmale> slyter's band murakami play   we need a lot of people there to prove to these venues that we can play with everyone else "
"i met some awesome people tonight and had a blast at my band's show   for once, i can say i am completely genuinely happy after a gig and that is saying a great deal "
<propfemale> christmas <propfemale> to all and an early <propfemale> christmas for those who do nothing on the <propfemale> 
i just got an acoustic guitar woooo!  but wow    i can't believe it   thank you sis  smile 
"i'm going to say it right now, i really think the social network deserves a best picture <propfirst>   and i predict it will do well   if not, toy story 3 definitely will "
"finding a girl and keeping a meaningful relationship is as easy as getting that last hdtv on black friday to the checkout without someone trying to steal it or you being shanked, attacked or punched   yep, it's that simple "
i never thought i'd say this but go oregon   i'm tired of hearing about cam <propmale> 
hooray!  the social network won four <propfemale> globes!
"you look so pretty, you glitter like gold     it's electric love "
if your current impression of me was your last what would it be?
very inspiring state of the union address obama   i hope people from both sides enlist more faith in you
