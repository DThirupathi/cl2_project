dwelling in the over-stimulating world of groton country life!
work work work   yay this is why i want to sing! working on auditions 
"<propmale>, as in god"
rediscovering the joys of <propmale> <propfirst>!
cramming for an audition! nothing like <propfemale> burana to make you feel like you're back in undergrad during jury week  who would've guessed high ds are what get your goose cooked! wish me luck!  smile

"feels like this describes his personality today: i'm just a little black raincloud hovering under a <propfemale> tree   i'm just a little black raincloud pay no attention to  little me   everyone knows that a raincloud never eats <propfemale>, no, not a nip   i'm just floating around over the ground wondering where i will drip   "
"so   finished grandpa and grandma's grandchildren quilt this weekend  it's super cute, if i do say so myself  and we finished 36 of the 42 heart cakes   i can still smell the frosting  i'm glad v day only comes once a year   "
corrected by the powers that be (grandma) we made 46 cakes   at $6 a piece 
is content   new cologne and argyle socks   happy quotient is high   enough to battle work? i think so 
"wonders why it takes management hearing a sarcastic, off-handed comment dripping with disdain to inquire about his happiness and value at the company he works at   "
thanks god for optimism! no <propfemale> solo  not yet anyway   syracuse symphony is doing it next season though   maybe i'll catch an audition for it
