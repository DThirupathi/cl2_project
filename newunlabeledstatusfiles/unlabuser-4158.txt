im sending out christmas cards starting tomorrow so those of you who get one are blessed! lol
"christmas is coming and i cant help but think about all the wonderful memories ive shared with family in the past and its sad to say that our traditions have faded into nothing more but memory  how i wish we could all pull together as a family once again and honor those traditions once more, but because of pety biccering and argumentative nature our family will once again be split apart on a holiday "
i cant help but wonder what your thinking     where are you? am i in your thoughts or am i just a novelty    
im so over it          sigh      this whole damn holiday can go to hell!!!! and some of the people in my life can go with it 
diabetes cha cha cha diabetes cha cha cha!!!!
im really trying to get into the holiday spirit but the closer christmas gets the less enthused and the more irritated i get  thinking about my stupid family members and how awful they are to their own mother just pisses me off royally  lets take bets to guess on how many people actually go to see my great grandmother    my bets on maybe 2
tell me what im supposed to do when i cant stop loving you when you know im too far away and even if i werent would it make a difference      im stuck here in the dark without any where to turn   help me make it out
i just deleted a bunch of people from my friends list    im tired of stupid posers being on my <propfemale> soooo if your still here cool you made the cut!!!!
just wanted to wish everyone a <propfemale> christmas!!!!
my hope for this year is that i make the decisions to better my life for once     that i realize how strong i really am inside and start leaning more on myself for things  two goals i have 1  get a part time job 2  find out more about going to school to become a mental health councelor
im so done with having to walk on eggshells for some people    well guess what its over and im done with you  i tried my damndest to make you happy and apparently im not good enough  im tired of longing for the relationship we used to have so im saying goodbye to it 
well i guess its a new year and a new begginning  im single and now living back with my parents in hamilton due to some really fucked up stuff that happened  if you want details get at me but the happy part is im back in hamilton again 
ok so in all the craziness thats happened while moving back i forgot my phone so i need everyone that means everyone to message me your <propfirst> again    thanks its much appreciated 
i for some reason thought this would be easy    but it cuts like a knife  i think i might need stitches

"im hoping this week is a little easier than the weekend, but i feel like its getting worse not better     i really need a job to pull through soon!!!"

i really need to find something for pain            anyone have any suggestions 
my cup my cup    sayin whats up to my cupah!!!!!
ok so second day of antibiotics and everytime i take one i get these little itchy bumps on random parts of me  pain is still severe in my lower back and hips pelvis abdomen  im not really sure what to do but it looks like if the pain doesnt slack off im headed back to the hospital 
yay fever time again    im sweatin it out bitches!!!
awwww yay     dose number two of antibiotics are makin me itchy and sick to my stomach again        awesome!!!!!!!!
i just really fucking love when someone that you thought was your everything breaks your damn heart and stomps on it   dumps you   lies to you    leads you to believe you could be together again and then says no  then they text you stupid shit like oh i miss everything about you           fuck off
"alrighty day 3 antibiotics are still kicking my ass  theres a metal taste in my mouth and now i just dont want to eat at all, but the pain is feeling a little different now  its sort of a muscle ache type feeling as apposed to a deep epnetrating hurt, so i guess thats improvement  im napping a lot lol just trying to get to feeling better "
jkgupotf65xe634sqlkjnqrtnb v4i8194y50o4ithyewr gguo!!!!!!!!!
im alive and junk    kinda feelin like barely though  was ok yesterday but feel a small set back today  its cool    this is gonna take a while but ill get there i suppose 
finally!!!!!! the pain has started to subside in my abdomin   i never thought it would happen but its starting to fade  i did talk to the doctor though and he said the infection probably left scarring on my pelvis and i may ache for a few weeks even  kinda sad about that but im doing better at last!
"no i cant take one more step    towards you  cause all thats waiting is regret  dont you know im not your ghost anymore    you lost the love i loved the most  ive learned to live half alive, and now you want me one more time "
"i honestly think        that you all        just need to let me be for now  literally let me catch my breath and brick my heart back up, so that i can continue on  because im feeling knocked down  and the person i opened up to, has, without malcontent, cut me deeper then i had thought  i need to mend  so no more talk of love          i beg you "
im gonna check out for a while if you absolutely need me or its an emergency my cell is listed in my info or you should already have it  thanks  smile   love 
"so i think ive officially sworn off love now  i thought about everything that its put me through in the past few years and i just cant say that its done much good for me  so, for a while at least, im not going to be dating anyone or talking to anyone with the hopes of falling back in love and spending the rest of my life with them  the friends that ive always had will remain of course but no new relationships "
i guess pearls diner + antibiotics + prescription anti nausea pills + a shot of  pepto= me feeling like im gonna be assed out in like 15 minutes    clothes off mysteriously and butt in the air    just gone lol thats why we call it assed out instead of passed out!!!!!!

"wow i absolutely love when people in my life that are supposed to be close to me get upset because i'm being responsible  this message isnt about one specific person   but any of my friends and family who are pissed because i work now and have schoolwork to worry about, can get the fuck over it "

im trying to breathe out the longing and take in the possibility  honestly at this point it may very well be the same thing     i feel a certain connection to all right now and theres definitely a change in the winds  i hear them whispering but i cant make out the words just yet  give me the strength to listen closer and find the rhythm of my true heart  you are on my mind     you know who you are   smile
