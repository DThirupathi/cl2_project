"if you have a best friend that will drop everything for you, be there through thick and thin, love you unconditionally even with all your faults and be the first one there to pick you up when you fall (and give you a much needed dose of reality or swift kick in the butt, if necessary) then copy and post this to your status  she or he will know who they are   smile "

"while you scream at your woman, there's a \man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear  while you humiliate,\offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and \reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, \there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your\woman cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her  post this on \your wall if you're against domestic violence"
really stressed out and worried for a friend and now i have to go put in 8hrs at work so i really hope that i have nice customers today because i'm not in a mood for irritating and grumpy ones     sad
