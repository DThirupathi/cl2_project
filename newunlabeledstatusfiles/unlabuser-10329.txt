i  am  ready 
"wanna go out and do something, yet do not wanna drive   gerrr"
"bored as a dog on the sidewalk without a ball, fire hydrant, or mailman in sight "

wishing may 1st never arrives  annoyed 
have i lost my mudge-ness?
you know something is warped in your life when your 5 yr old sister is singing the beginning of bad romance   i definitely have lost my mudge-ness

pants and shorts are getting too big  now i have to resort to wearing my brothers old  stuff(that he didn't even wear)
watermelon! nom nom nom!  smile 
"hate those dreams that are so close to reality, but no where near coming true"
"i keep hearing \pure imagination\"" from <propmale> wonka on tv    it just gets my hopes up that the movie is on    but of course at&t has to disappoint me  annoyed """
today shall be    interesting   
"\you're so smart! what am i going to do without you?\""-now my mother decides to appreciate me?   """
"\you're not sweating  you're lactating!\""-i would hate to be the guy that was told that"""
"\your lips tremble but your eyes are in a straigt stare  we're on the bed but your clothes are laying right there\""-metro station"""
time to leave  procrastination station!!!
james: \it's like he said: marvelous things will happen  \,d26fa5c15a3a040d216ed844a20220b5,professor magonagal as a nun? great distraction from me being a baby   
life is better when <propmale> on!
"first \bad romance\"" and now \""tik tok\""    my sister needs to watch more cartoons and stop listening to the radio   """
watching chem videos and looking at worksheets to try and cram for exam  sad part is i'm actually learning
soooo am i allowed to throw away all my school stuff now? i feel like i shouldn't but classes are over   
i most certainly will not forget the day of unpantsuiting!
wishing my internal clock would set itself a few hours later   still need to figure out how to go see vinny <propmale> 's show today   annoyed 
"\so i heard you are going to u of gay!\""    thanks - -"""
a spoon full of peanut butter doesn't help the medicine go down  but it sure does make me feel better  smile 
bliss  smile 
"<propfemale> <propmale>, <propfemale> clause, and sneaking off to someones house o o this is what happens when i sleep without blankets   "

just decided on my next photoshop project  make an avatar! ready and up for the challenge! well    tomorow
"what if the sorting hat rested on someones head and yelled \homosexual!\"" haha oh the things people say  smile """
just got a new bike!!!!
my average bed time has changed to like 9 smile 0  i feel like an old geezer!
"how is it the longer i sleep, the worse i feel?"
"working on my next photo project  it's going well, all that is left is to put the stuff that will make it special  smile "
"okay, i'm done for the night  made progress in some places, not so much in others *sigh* it's summer and i still want more time!  annoyed  g'night"
is it weird that i suddenly wish my name was balto? you should all call me that from now on 
does anyone have some good album suggestions?
trying to have a conversation w  my mom in spanish so my sister wouldn't know = fail 
i got a rubber space duckie!!!  laugh  i think i will put it in my next photoshop project! starting tonight!
"i wanna stay like this, forever  if only i could promise, forever  then we could just be we  forever you and me  forever and ever- wtp"
"but when the morning comes, and the sun begins to rise  i will lose you, because it's just a dream, when i open up my eyes, i will lose you \i used to believe in forever, but forever's too good to be true  i've <propmale> a wish on every <propfemale>, it hasn't done much good so far  i can only dream of you, wherever you are - wtp"
so i couldn't give blood this morning(darn permission slips!) but i found out i am o positive! whatever that means lol

phineas and ferb sing songs?
"so the luck dragon in the never ending story is falkor, i thought it was balkior    that's close right?"
i just took my laptop apart to fix the charger port because it wouldn't charge  but the reason it wouldn't charge was because it wasn't plugged into the wall   
"ya know, i used to not care  but now it seems like theres nothing else for me to think about   "
"the <propfemale>  is whole  the air, filled with a rare life that dances in every breath  and i the simple soul  wish for nothing but truth "
"my mom \you look like you haven't slept in days \"" dang it! she's catching on!"""
dumbledore? what an old coot! he's nothing like rumbleroar!
to sleep is to strip oneself of all securities  to dream is to confront your largest obstalce: yourself  take these risks for a few hours of wonderful peace  smile 
just remembered i still need to finish gone with the wind    hmmm   do i want to?
come back to bed with me  we'll talk the day away  and before we hold each other close  i'll wisper my dreams and pray you stay   
"? all alone with nothin to do, don't give a hoot? well f  you! ?  laugh "
my sleep routine schedule habits are soooooooo out of whack!!! t_t
kinda finding it a little retarded that fb doesn't notify me of things until hours later   
end now my sleepless night  let's dream of sand & ocean breeze  and in the clouds we take our flight  to share joy we make with ease   
going out to buy nine   smile 
"which would you rather do, eat <propmale> or drink from a hose? i personally choose the hose    but apparently i am weird   "
on this pillow rest your head  think not of woes but dreams instead  don't worry if it makes no sense  like double rainbow    so intense 
inception  what a movie! now time to go to bed and dream(   if i'm not dreaming already =p)
"i feel like there is something that i haven't done in a while, and i really wanna do it   i just don't know what it is!!!!"

"i feel like writing essays would be similar to child birth: no one ever wants to go through it, the longer it takes the worse you feel, and if you don't think it through you're never satisfied with the end result "
"french, italian, japanese, or   spanish  i wanna pick a foreign language, but not sure what    ugh   "
"sometimes i don't know why i bother, and then i wake up and feel like i don't need a reason  we just do the things we do because they make us happy, for however long that may be "
