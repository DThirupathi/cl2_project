"just saw the book of <propmale>    really good movie, didn't have an idea what it was about before i went to see it though "
gotta roll    employment test for the census bureau  wish me luck!

"been studying and i feel i should take extra precaution on future presentations  i feel like i got a good start, but there's a lot more i can do to make it better "
"hey i freelance computer repair  if you need anything fixed, installed, cleaned, added to just contact me here on facebook "
taking a break til my head stops squeezing at me  geez its horrible later ppl 
the things i get from e playful eriences show me a vivid yet indescribable outlook on where i should go next in my future and i just try each day to keep it in perspective 
reachin 4 the unattainable
lost answers
chasing stars   
"\still listenin'   \"""""
i feel like i need a change of scenery    or just a big change  things are getting boring  i dunno    maybe i'm just tired of the same stuff  (4-walled prison)
thanks everybody for the birthday wishes  i hope you all have a happy new year!
somethings missing    
"panning is hard  on second thought, taking pics of birds in flight is way harder "
i just need a <propfemale> to say how much i am hating the new way you view photos on facebook its awful 
"what the heck is goin on w  facebook?! it keeps askin for my password every other <propfemale>!! on another note, liking a few songs on this lasers album  its not food & liquor or the cool but still solid "
looking for subject matter for my photography projects  these cloudy days aren't giving me too many ideas though
