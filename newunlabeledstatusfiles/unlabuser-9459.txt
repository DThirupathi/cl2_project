"if 3 6 weapons co  was a set of twin babies i would lock one in a black exterior interior sedan with the windows rolled up in an abandonded lot during the hottest and brightest day of the year, then slowly take a cheese grater to the other ones face after i use a carrot peeler on its torso only to huck the, hopefully, still somwhat living glob of meat and baby fat onto the 3rd rail in a nearby subway "
i am a free man

"fuck va hospitals, it's bad enough their facilities are dirtier than <propfemale> <propmale>'s bug infested floors, but the personell at jamaica plains make it seem like they are hired for the sole purpose of dropping one's disability rating to help save the government some money  i swear to christ's bloody wrists i will eat their first born or at least start using my tricare instead"
"i never thought i'd live to see a gang rape on national television    then the ravens faced the jets  <propfirst> <propfirst> bruised egos, bodies and souls but i'm sure just picked up at least 2 endorsements on that monster hit late in the game  p s  <propfirst> gruden, how does <propmale> <propfirst>'s cock taste? considering he was all you talked about  leave the girly crushes to the preteens and their boy bands"

well that was quite the 72 hour hardcore shitshow  time to detox from this weekend in lovely boston traffic    
"the wife is having a breakfast meeting with mayor menino today, hope she doesn't throw salt in any fork wounds she might inflict  but on the plus side, this 2 hour commute into the city for a 15 breifing should make for an interesting stroke on rt 1 "
"who ever it was at the va that scheduled these psyche appointments for me obviously needs to be dragged out into the street and publicly executed via cinder block  the timing of them have just been atrociously perfect to put me in only the thickest of traffic through the congested, vehicular nightmare that is boston "

"stop trying to get me into this stupid <propfirst> game or i'll penetrate you that many times with a cactus dipped in hot sauce  you choose the number but i choose the hole  and why is the media non-stop blaring 30 years of a dead <propfirst> lennon but yesterday, a day that actually meant more to the nation believe it or not, was nothing but a footnote on the back pages of every mind and channel? another reason to hate hippies"
at the vfw
so fixing the porch isn't going to be quick but after it's done i'm taking my rightful seat on the living room throne to watch the urlacher get his jaw snapped off and used to stab <propfirst> cutler's mom in her wretched uterus  i hope all the players on the bear's vaunted defense die horrific deaths in front of their families on christmas <propfemale> 
"pats, booze and greasy food "
"pats win, clinch playoff berth, jets lose and my porch is still standing  one helluva fine day  p s  dear bears fan talking shit to me, i won't mention you by name, <propfirst>, but i just wanted to know if you enjoyed washing down all that shame with your boyfriends semen after eating your own words "

prime rib
trying to piece together the events of the past week   
"let's see, the last time i was in times square i lost count at 20 shots, threatened a bartenders life, kinda choked a strip club manager, attempted to kick in the wrong hotel room door after getting lost in the stair well and puking on the railing only to crash my truck on the drive home  fast forward 3 years and i hope this new years <propfemale> with my ol' war buddies is just as memorable"
"long story short, i'm alive and well after all those shenanigans"
back in the gym after a long 10 days  my new years resolution is to find and spar with that damn midget that i've been told scampers around before i get to the gym 
"i will be getting my hair cut today for the first time since my retirement in august  the beard, however, will remain as fierce and \abe lincoln-y\"" as ever and will be in full force for <propmale>'s birthday liver destroying extravaganza tonight"""
"it's a sick game played by two parties  one party, the birthday celebrator, must consume all the liqour put in front of him during the night and following morning with the intention of surviving  the 2nd party, friends and family, must keep a steady supply of booze going into the celebrator with the intention of killing him her  to the <propfirst> goes bragging rights and a story to be reminisced upon in future gatherings"
"shoveled my 38 ft driveway, my company's loading area and storage shed this morning  i've haven't hated snow like this for years  oh and i hope all of you working fucks with a competent owner enjoyed your day off  wolfing down whiskey and meat to calm the anger demons that have been feasting all day "
e playful elling my rage at the gym 
"\i pick things up and put them down \""     gym then building the aspiring chef of a wife a spice rack so she can cook meat more efficiently for me"""
making an obnoxious amount of bacon to help soak up the equally appalling amount of whiskey i am to consume this morning afternoon while watching football  can't wait to see cromartie get burned time and again when the pats stomp the shit out of those bunch of thugs foot lovers sideline trippers  maybe <propfirst> namath will make another drunken appearance on national television
well that certainly sucked 
"well with the football season officially ending for me yesterday and the varying times of the other two winter sports teams schedules being non compliant with my long work days, i will spend this time to drop a rap album, start my campaign for governor in 2020, buy a house and start checking those pesky names off that certain list  but how many am i serious about doing? baseball season needs to hurry up"
out with a few fuckheads getting back at my liver tonight  gotta piss through my riches somehow  
i made it home   ? what? how?
(insert steeves' normal angry rant here)     too tired but yet i still harbor so much hate
"it's new england, if you live here then you have no right to bitch about the snow  shut the fuck up and grab a shovel  which leads me to my next point  where the hell are all the kids who offer their slave labor for a few bucks to shovel your driveway or whatever? lazy pricks  i can't wait to have kids  let's do the math, kids = indentured servitude = i win "
the character limit on these status updates save you all from some of my manic rants 
"tomorrow decides a whole helluva lot for me  i have been still am will most likely be just the worst type of person, but perhaps god will be too busy causing a natural disaster in some over populated 3rd world country to notice me trying to be successful in life  of course if that happens, <propfemale> will piss away billions of dollars to help said country, which in turn will piss me off, then i stroke out due to rage "
"yesterday just earned me a better tomorrow  with a week off ahead of me, let the incessant celebrations continue "
"i have this week off, drank heavily the past few nights and yet i still get up at 6am  the heavy doses of testosterone my endocrinologist prescribed me are working all too well  oh, anyone else notice dunkin' donuts' chose february to unleash their \chocolate lovers month\"" campaign? black history and dark chocolate culinary tidbits  there must've been zero black guys on the idea panel for that gem  god bless <propfemale>"""
"urge to kill, rising "
"<propfirst>'s being taking off life support tonight at 7pm at his request  nothing like sitting in a hospital room waiting for someone to die in front of you while their family undoubtedly cries  honestly, i hope it's quick and relatively painless  he was a wwii veteran with the u s  navy, god bless his soul and god bless <propfemale> "
"still waiting for that \pop\"" sound that lets me know you finally got your head out of your ass """
whiskey and vodka mix together just dandy    psyche
