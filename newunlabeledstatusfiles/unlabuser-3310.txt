"wake up every morning, a thousand <propmale> from home, praying for forgiveness, for this aching in my bones, it would be so easy to find a better way  oh but i know i'll never change, cause i love the long shot, and the left out lost causes, hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses, i ride the wrong road just as fast as i can, god knows there's no one else to blame, sometimes i think i get off on the pain"
"well the truth, well it hurts to say, im gonna pack up my bags and im gonna go away, i'm gonna split, i can't stand it, im gonna give it up and quit and aint never coming back\girl but before i get to going, i've got to say, i know you used to love me but that was yesterday, and the truth, i won't fight it, when the love stops burning you got to do what's right, oh lover lover lover you don't treat me no good no more"
