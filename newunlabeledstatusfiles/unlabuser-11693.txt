"if you have a dog who has made you laugh, brightened your life, silently accepted your tears without judgment, snuggled with you, forgiven your faults and loved you anyway, make this your status  dogs are a gift most of us don't deserve  repost this if you have an amazing dog or have had amazing dogs that are no longer with us!!"
