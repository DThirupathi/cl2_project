heading to bed      tuesdays are always hectic for me 
"i'm trying to catch on to this website, but here as late i seem to be brain dead, so please be patient     who ever came up with the phrase (day off) simply because they were not working at a job was definitely a man  i have done twice the work at home today and it was my only (day off) this week      lol "
"i'm sorry for not joining the farming frenzy that seems to be going on, on here but at the moment i just don't have the time   j t  is getting ready to have surgery again  i have been so stressed out about it, that i only get on here for a few minutes when i can  hopefully towards the end of april things will be alittle less hetic and i can enjoy being alittle more social  love ya all!"
"please request pray for j t  at church tomorrow     he is to have the surgery monday morning and he will be out for about 6 hours          they got the blood today that was donated for him, so everything is ready for monday  thanks"
i want to thank everyone that was keeping j t  in they're prayers  it was a hard day for all of us today     his surgery was only supposed to be 6 hours which is quite a long time for a 12 year old  he went in at 8am this morning and didn't get out until 6pm       yes (10 hours) when they called at the 6 hour time frame and said they would call again in 2 hours i about died     
they said they were able to recycle his own blood for awhile but had to use 1 unit and still had the other on hold  i had to go out at the 8 hour <propfirst> and have my own private nervous breakdown in the <propfirst> when they said they still weren't done but he was stable        lol 
anyways we finally got to see him around 7pm the dr  said that he did great he is staying in the recovery room overnight just as a precaution he is one tried little boy as am i  i'll try to get on later to tell more          again thanks for the prayers 
j t  is not doing good  they have had to give him another unit of blood and the pain meds are causing alot of vomiting  until his labs start looking better and the post-op swelling goes down they will keep him  this is our 13th day being here and we are all totally exhausted   so please keep him him your prayers that he gets to doing better so we can all go home         love ya all
first off happy easter to everyone! well i must have had some keeping j t  in their prayers as he has done a complete 360 turnaround  his lab work is back to normal  they went an cut out (windows) on his cast and the post-op swelling is gone except for a little on his right foot 
j t  has not thrown up since saturday late afternoon  if he his still good by tomorrow morning they plan on pulling the central line out and putting a pressure dressing on  then they are doing labs again and an xray           if after all that with everything looking good we will get to go home  i'm keeping my fingers crossed  love ya all
"we are home     thanks to everyone for the prayers and encouragement, it meant alot  i posted a few pics  it is so good to be home, j t  was so happy to be in his own bed as we will be too and that's where i'm heading  night all and love to ya all "
man how i have missed home      i didn't even mind doing the dishes and some laundry    i was home  i even enjoyed unpacking everything because we were home  j t  ate everything today and didn't whimper once    i know he was happy to be home to    home     home      home       there's no place like home     can yea tell i'm happy to be home        lol
"i wish heaven had a phone so i could hear your voice again i thought of you today, but that is nothing new, i thought about you yesterday, and days before that too i think of you in silence, i often speak your name all i have are memories and a picture in a frame your memory is a keepsake, from which i'll never part  god has you in his arms,i have you in my heart  repost if you have someone in heaven!!!!!"
