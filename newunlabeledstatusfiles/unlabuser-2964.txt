"(part 2)i was crestfallen  i had to pay the additional $18, of course  and on my way to the car, i was mad at myself  but i paused and took a deep breath  â€œinstead of thinking of this as a negative thing, i have to figure out how it is a good thing,â€� i told my dad over the phone on my drive back to gainesville  â€œhow?â€� he asked me  â€œi donâ€™t know,â€� i replied, â€œi just know that i canâ€™t let this become a negative thing â€�"
"(3) when i got home, i carefully unwrapped the tea set, washed each piece carefully, and as i was toweling them dry, i looked over at the lamp with the broken glass top  i could crazy glue the pieces back together, i thought to myself  argh  i was still trying to overcome my self-doubt "
"(4) and then, it occurred to me that the lamp represented me; that as torn and shattered as i may feel, i have a strong base to rest on; itâ€™s up to me  i decide that no matter what, i am going to let my light shine "
