"ok, so i just finished a bowl of the most wonderful homemade bean soup  made by a friend that puts up with me staying with her every so often  she sure is lucky that she lives 4 hours away or i would be at her house every night  i guess what made it more wonderful is that it is cold, gray, and raining  what better time to eat a bowl of homemade soup  thanks so much <propfemale>   <propfemale> p  purvis"
oooooo baby it's cold outside  it has gotten up to 44 now  i real heat wave            nooooot
i had my h1n1 shot yesterday      so now i can't keep from rooting around in the kitchen and pigging out       wonder why????
"whoooo, calling for a  foot of snow starting tomorow afternoon     l want it to start early so i can go home early      haven't had a good old fashioned snow fall for a lot of years   let all you out of towners know how much we really do end up with       sure have been fooled before    "
wats goin on!!!!! it is spooke quiet in my building at work       only me in the whol building       i guess the main buuilding is bussling but i am alone here        ohhhhhhh
"ok, so 14in snow has cancelled church today and work tomorrow      probably tues  also and then winter holiday begins  so i got off work at 2 on friday and don;t go back till the 4th of january        paid for it all        life is good and so is our god !!!!"
for those local friends that have been following the dugan story     i sadly need to add this      <propfemale> cunninghm (<propfemale>'s sister) has just fallen and broke her ankle in 2 places    as i write this she is in surgery       don't know any more except <propfemale> is still very sick  please pray for these 2 jones girls and <propfirst> as she sees to the needs of both      
i just got a call that my cousin in illinois died this morning of a massave heart attack     she was one of only 3 living relatives       we reconceted after over 30 years last summer and i wil miss her greatly    i am trying to get a flight out of somewhere to be there     her 96 yr old mom lives with her       please pray i can find a cheap flight out and for me while i am there
went to see voyage of the <propfemale> tredder in 3d with the girls tonight  then had to to say good by till i get back to asheville maybe in april    had such a fun time with all 4 of them   sure is hard to say good by when it isnt an good by at all  only a sad bye    
ok so now we have a winter storm watch      starting tomorrow morning through friday morning      will we have 1 or 2 days off or will we just go late friday morning???  looks like more of an icing event than snow    as always it could just pass us over   those mountains make it impossible to predict what will happen         
ok lets try this again     calling for a lot of snow this weekend       sure do hope so    
ok so <propfemale> does not want to call off her big birthday bash     let it snow only at my house and let it snow bunches !!!!!!!!
