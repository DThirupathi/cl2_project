happy friday!!!!!!!!!  smile 
it's 7:47 on a friday night and i am thinking about going to bed   how very sad      when did i get so old

today is a smiley sort of day  smile 
very nervous today    
"hurray!  survived day number one with my new little delights   only a few tears, but at least they weren't mine!"
"really enjoys her job, but is so glad tomorrow is friday   everything one seems a bit happier on fridays   "

"i love my kids more than anything in the world, but i can't help but wonder why i insist on putting my personal fears and e playful eriences on them   why can't i let them be who they are and not worry so much?  i think i'm having a bad mommy day  sad "

"ceileigh is spending the night at grandma and papa's and <propfirst> is teaching at aic tonight, so miss caitlynn and i are having some much needed alone time   we went shopping at justice then to friendlys for supper   being alone with her has made me realize how much i miss her and how important it is to take the time to enjoy each of my girls   i love my babies "
"so, i think we have finally settled on a name for baby girl #3   <propfirst> is embarrassed to admit that we are naming her after a <propmale> <propfemale> song, but unfortunately for him, i'm not   i like <propmale> and love our little sweet <propfemale>  it's probably the only <propmale> <propfemale> song that he'll sing along with(but he probably won't admit that either)     now the debate over the middle name    "
caitlynn is singing in the shower   loudly   that girl cracks me up 
"baby <propfemale> and i had a doctors appointment today   good strong heartbeat and she is wiggling around like crazy in there, but, apparently, <propfemale> likes cookies (and other not so healthy things) a bit too much   whatever   cookies make us happy   *sigh*"

i'm 2 3 done!!!!
"spending the morning trying to figure out what we need to get ready for miss <propfemale>'s arrival   when did baby stuff gets e playful ensive!?!?  we must not have needed much with ceileigh and i think most of the stuff we needed for caitlynn were gifts   lesson to everyone out there:  do not get rid of your baby stuff unless you are 100% super duper sure you're done!!!  btw, does she really *need* a car seat?  smile "
"we took the girls on a little road trip to see the enchanted village at <propfirst>'s furniture in avon, <propfemale>   it was very sweet and nostalgic   the girls loved it!  they also had a 4-d polar e playful ress ride and a holiday laser light show   it was a a great time   there's something about the look of amazement and wonder in the eyes of little kids during the holiday season that totally made it worth the long drive!"
"today i am thankful for my two (almost three) beautiful little girls, my wonderful husband, my family, and my friends   i feel truly blessed to have such wonderful people in my life   happy thanksgiving!!!"
