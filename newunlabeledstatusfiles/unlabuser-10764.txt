2013 you have the potential to be so much  don't get caught up in the hear and now  regardless of what others are doing always do what you know you should  the world is yours take it 
1927 you are a song bird  let your voice speak for you and the world will be quite and take notice 
2631 hey first! i haven't spoken to you in years! you were always very committed to being yourself back in the day i hope that hasn't changed 
1914 first really just really  second you are all i could ask for in a friend  you noisy and loud but i love it  you keep me up on all i need to know  you have definitely been a key part of my success at jsu

708 we have seen each other through many men and may see each other through a few more  a true friend and confidant 
9812 over the years we have become distant and i don't know why  i still remember university success and the foolishness we pulled in there  you are a truly unique individual  don't let anyone change you 
9 my friend   so much i could say but only one thing i will  don't let true love slip away   she's right there just grab her   don't let the haters and chicken heads convince you otherwise 
when you become blinded by your need for fifteen minutes fame you hurt more than you help  to be considered a true leader you should put your followers first   you have failed 
your decision are who you are now and forever more  make choices that will make your world take notice  for what is the world but a bunch of decisions that of bunch of you made  live for the world   which is you
