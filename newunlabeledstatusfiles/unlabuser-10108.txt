"i like english yet, the professors i have had for it have completely sucked, and the course curriculum is so basic i feel im back in 5th grade learning the basics of writing and what not  its english 101, i shouldnt feel im taking a remedial course  and now i cant even find an open class to replace it with  ugh "

listening to the runaways & <propfirst> pilgrim soundtrack + homework 
"i wish i had a magic ball that i could check every night to make sure if its worth getting up the next day, or if its going to be yet another plain boring, pointless or dreadful day  in which case i would just stay in bed enjoying sleep rather than lifes madness  blah "
"going to make myself some instant coffee(ewww) because i can feel myself crashing,( woke up too damn early ) n i still have some very boring homework to do  in the \blah\"" mood """
"my very first vet e playful erience, was not a pleasant one  it was weird  the doc seemed fake  n the people waiting in the lobby all looked n acted like they got out of the mental hospital(no offense anyone) "
"some lady sat so close to me n got so close to my personal space (which i truly value) i wanted to run for the door  kept smiling and trying so hard to start a convo about the cats or anything for that matter  she completely looked like she had taken too many \happy pills\"" this morning  really  it was bad """
"and everyone else kept looking at each other like we are the animal lover community so we should just start hugging or something  yes we have something in common, we all own animals, they are all sick  thats it  stop staring at because its creeping me out  and i do not do small talk talk with strangers  period "
"especially dont do small talk with people that get too close to my face, smile when theres nothing to smile about (your pet is sick bitch, your at the vet its not funny) and are bouncing off the walls like 5 a five year old  geez this was a rant  i had to let it out "
"i'm done, i feel better  smile "
"ugh i need to focus, i keep getting sidetracked   keep repeating to myself \ oh its still early i have time to bs around\"" for the past like 6 hrs  ugh"""
