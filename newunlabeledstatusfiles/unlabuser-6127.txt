how i miss her so
is wondering when the endless wandering of my up and down life is going to reach its climatic and wonderfully boring end
"is wondering why she plagues me mind like a virus, eroding and pesteringmy heart and soul, fueling my hate and my anger; making me wish i couldforget it all, to forget her, to forget what that horrible feeling was "
is wondering why people are just as boring as my life 
is wandering the shadows for answers 
"knowing you were in love and lost it all sucks; knowing that you were the cause for it, sucks a little bit more "
"best way to hook up with your true love?\kill the psycho that was stalking her across the country in her bedroom with his gun\then make out and have dirty passionate sex with her while the stalker's corpse watches you \\gotta love soa  laugh "
it may be a few hours late: happy b-day tinka  miss you
is wandering the shadows for answers 
wandering the shadows of the soul wondering when the moment of absolution finally reaches us all 
surprisingly? today has been a really good day  now itz time to dive into the musical world of tron @d
"it's amazing how we all can agree that i'm an asshole, even i agree  laugh "
"as things roll by, through our mind; like fleeting ships in space  locked against the black glass, held in place by a cruel brace; twirling in motion without acceleration  burnt an beaten, crumbling like a withering flower slowly losing all <propfemale>  twirling in place, lost in space forever floating in any but no direction without motivation "
