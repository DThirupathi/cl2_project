"there are three types of people in this world, those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened"
the feeling when things change for the better and you figure out what really matters    
when you see someone you used to know but you dont really say anything    thats awkward
beginings are usually scary and endings are usually sad but its everything in between that makes it all worth living

"people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do "

"everyone says they want to be remembered, everyone says they want to make a difference, so when the time comes to make a choice, how can people say that they dont care?"
have you ever wondered which hurts more: saying something and wishing you had not or saying nothing and wishing you had?
i'm amazed at how you get everything you want      
"a stranger stabs you in the front, a friend stabs you in the back, a boyfriend stabs you in the heart, but best friends only poke eachother with straws  smile "
"i wish i could tell you i understand, that i know how you feel but the truth is i dont know, and i don't think i will ever understand exactly how you feel  all i can do now is try to understand, to make it okay   "

we stopped looking for monsters under our beds when we realized they were hiding in the people around us   
"you can close your eyes to things you don't want to see, but you can't close your heart to the things you don't want to feel "
giving up doesn't always mean you are weak â€¦ sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go
and yeah    i guess thats it 
"as long as we have memories, the past remains  as long as we have dreams the future awaits!"
vague-booking: the act of posting a very vague status on facebook so people will wonder ask whats wrong  admit it we have all done this haha 
"it seems like when you are all the way back in september the the year will just go on and on forever, but when you finally get to may and school is almost out you wonder where the year went "

at the end of the day the people that really matter are going to be the ones standing beside you watching the sunset and assuring you that it will rise again in the morning
