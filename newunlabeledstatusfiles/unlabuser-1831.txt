you know you went shopping when    they turn your debit card off for suspicious activity  that's what i'm talkin about  
"our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate; it is that we are powerful beyond measure  it is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us  we ask, who am i to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? actually, who are you not to be? your playing small does not serve the world   it is in everyone  as we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others "
sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy   sunshine in my eyes can make me cry   sunshine on the water looks so lovely   sunshine almost always makes me high! (theme song of the day)
