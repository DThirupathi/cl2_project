"what if i'm overtaken, what if i never make it?, what if no one's there?, will you hear my prayer? when you take that first step into the unknown, you know that he won't let you go  so what are you waiting for? what do you have to lose? your insecurities they try to hold to you but you know you're made for more, so don't be afraid to move, your faith is all it takes and you can walk on the water too!"
"lord <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference "
"how many tears must i cry before i learn to say good-bye, i make the same mistakes all the time    what if im overtaken? what if i never make it? what if no one's there? will you hear my prayer?"
"if the source of my ambition is the treasure i obtain, if i measure my successes on a scale of earthly gain, if the focus of my vision is the status i attain, my accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain  i'm laying down my arms and running helplessly to yours  i surrender all my human soul desires  if sacrafice requires that all my kingdoms fall, i surrender all"
"how many times must i cry before i learn to say good-bye? i make the same mistakes all the time   i don't wanna cry anymore, i wanna be pushin to an open door   i see the clouds roll in, i hear the thunder crash, i see the lightning strike and i feel the rain on my tear stained face, i shoulda seen it coming, im sorry you're hurting and im sorry i wasn't as strong as you thought i was "
"one tear in the driving rain, one voice in a sea of pain, could the maker of the stars hear the sound of my breakin' heart? one light, that's all i am, right now i can barely stand, if you're everything you say you are, won't you come close and hold my heart? so many questions without answers, your promises remain, i can't sleep but i'll take my chances to hear you call my name    "
"what do u do when u feel like everyone you thought you could turn to or people who are your \friends\"" don't really seem to care? when they call our name we come running but if the roles were switched would they do the same for you?"""
"questions, problems, answers    i've got none "
"im desperate for every word you say, to know you more than i could ever imagine  im over this! im tired of my old ways, im chasin after you, lord, reveal yourself to me!"
"in ur ocean i'm ankle deep\\i feel the waves crashing on my feet\\it's like i know where i need 2 be, but\i can't figure out\just how much air i'll need 2 breathe\\when ur wave crashes over me\\there's only 1 way to figure out   \in a day dream, i couldn't live like this\\i wouldn't stop till i found somethin beautiful\\when i wake up, knowing all i have \\is still not what i need    all i need is you!"
"it's ur life do whatcha gpnna do, the world is watchin u  everyday the choices u make say what u r and who ur heart beats for, itâ€™s an open door, itâ€™s ur life! are u who u always said u would be? with a sinking feeling in ur chest, always waiting for someone else to fix u  tell me when did u forget to live the way that u believe?  this is ur opportunity to let ur life be 1 that lights the way for all to see!"
"the creator of all the earth, he never grows weak or weary, no 1 can measure the depths of his understanding, he gives power 2 the weak, n strength 2 the powerless, even youth will become weak n tired, n young men will fall in exhaustion, but those who trust in the lord will find new strength, they will run n not grow weary, they will walk n not faint"
"why is that you can do things for people and give them things and they just leave it carelessly behind as they move on to a so called new life? you can go for long periods of time and not truly know who a person is, it's time to move on and make a new!"
"sometimes in order hear him, you have to pull yourself away from the chaos of life and actually have a intimate conversation with him    never underestimate the power of prayer  smile "
