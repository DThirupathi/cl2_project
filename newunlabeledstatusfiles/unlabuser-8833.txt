happy new year everybody!\\n- druggy drummer hamster -
having trouble keeping my head on my shoulders  duct tape doesn't help a bit either 
"but what do you say to taking chances, what do you say to jumping off the edge? never knowing if there's solid ground below or hand to hold, or hell to pay, what do you say, what do you say?"
just got home from playing in my first soccer game as a goalkeeper  made a few good stops and let a few go but it wasn't too bad 
just got home from shutter island  everbody said it was stupid and confusing but i loved it because it was confusing  ireally wish i had more time to <propfemale> out with my friends  i have too much to do 
i hate right angles  i will forever hate right angles 
just finished another poem if you'd like to read 
"\everything is fucking green!\"""""
"look to the future but dont ever forget your past  your past is, after all, the reason you are who you are today "
i just realized that the front lawn of the school is way to green 
"i graduate, turn 18, and have a new job all on the same day  today will be either the best day of my life or the worst but i hope its the best  thanks everybody "
"graduate, turn 18, and get your first job all on the same day    im not sure ive had a more important day in my life  thanks for everything guys "
attention!: i find four leaf clovers bring me bad luck! i have about four or five right now  one is already promised to someone but if you would like one let me know and you can have it!
i wish i could sing like <propfemale> <propfemale> 
i love my friends

is finally getting a laptop 
so the bookbag and all the software for the laptop arrived  the only thing missing is the laptop 
i finally learned to stop looking at the bad things in life  then they run and jump in front of me to remind me that they're there to stay! smile  ain't life great?!
just learned how to play chasing cars smile 
"just gonna stand there and watch me burn but that's alright because i like the way it hurts\just gonna stand there and hear me cry but that's alright because i love the way you lie"
why must everyone have a good friday the 13th except me?
thank god for friends cause i have no idea where id be without them 
"i'm not afraid to take a stand\everybody come take my hand\we'll walk this road together, through the storm\whatever weather, cold or warm\just lettin' you know that, you're not alone\holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
fuck  my  life  and  the  world 
mind  officially  blown  away 
life sucks  therefore i shall flip it a bird and continue my walk right through the middle of it while keeping a smile on my face just to piss it off 
"life sucks even worse today  i have no energy to flip it a bird let alone smile  so today i'm just not going to react to anything it throws at me, even the bullshit, and hopefully that will piss it off as bad as what i did last time "
i could really use a wish right now

playing poker with people that are just drunk as hell is sooooo much fun smile  if only it were real money annoyed

"poker, <propmale>, friends, and no common sense tomorrow  this is gonna be hilarious "
"great day ends in a migrane, heartburn, and misery  but eveytime i think about sliding down the hill on a piece of cardboard with a smiling cop passing by, it doesnt seem so bad "
finally got the lesson in <propmale> and the teacher let us go an hour early  now i get a 3 hour nap instead of 2!
i dont want to do this anymore 
f my life 
apparently when i flipped life the bird and kept smiling it decided to come up behind me and trip me  it laughed when i fell on my face 
loves bullshit  no    i'm serious! world please share all your bullshit with me        oh    you already have!
i decided to cook some eggs for dinner and i cracked one egg  normal  the next egg had 2 yolks  has anyone ever heard of this?
