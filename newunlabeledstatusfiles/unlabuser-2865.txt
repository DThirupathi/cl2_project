wow alright well they just had some band ppl start to play some song about needing a bail out and a hand out and it just made me think of how it might have been nice to get a bail out when my family was living out of tents and my mom was still working her ass off   and then they had a nerve to quote the bible saying good things come to those who work for it    give me a break   alright thats my opinion of the day

haha love getting 53%'s on papers and know ur still getting a b in the class   i dont know what all these college kids are stressing about   i just do what i have to just to pass   its kinda a family modo lol
wow how gracious of uci to not only keep my non refundable deposit of 500$ but allow me to get out of the cambridge fees with only an additional 500$ fee   so now im paying 1000$ for absolutely nothing   but in the email they made it very clear that they were doing me a rare favor    lucky me  and im only mad cuz they made it sound like they were doing me some extravagant favor  god i hate school
