"moving on can be hard but sometimes you just have to  sometimes you hurt urself more then u thought you would  <propfemale>ner or later uot to learn lifes never a fairytail, your never a <propfemale> and no ones gonna swoop down and pick you off your feet  <propfemale> u need to pick ur self up and keep moving down the brick road to find tht one guy who will rlly show you they arent all the same "
"life can be sad, evil, and sometimes very good  but when u have the feeling tht your life going rlly good when for a while its been just plan evil u have a hard time beliving it  your scared to get used to cause u know once you do life will just take it away from you and you wont know what to do "
life is short so live it up and never back down   unless its somthiong u rlly do know ur wrong  lolz so for now im living up high school for as long as i can lolz 
life has its ups and down we all have our share of each my lifeis in an up for now love it and hope it stay i love you all
i got to love him hes so sweet and funny and likes to protect me i think i may just be falling rlly hard for him i hope he doesnt walk out of my life anytime soon
life was so much easier when we all thought everyone had cooties & and the only drama was fighting over our crayons  
"to my best friend   i hope you know how much you are appreciated   when all else fails, i can always count on you!  love ya"
"note to self: today after proudly licking the bus windows with my helmet on, now it's time to  eat paste and lick that container clean,, oh boy lunch time!!"
"kisses blown are kisses wasted, kisses arent kisses unless their tasted, kisses spread germs and germs are hated but baby you can kiss me im vacinated"
today was okay i didnt feel to good i rlly dont wanna go to skool anymore
is going on a trip  some nice men in white with a big net showed up put me in a jacket so i can hug myself  yay this is gonna be fun!!
the rules   yeah they don't apply to me
in high school you make friends from every grade or atleast i do but year by year they all graduate and then ur stuck with them leaving ur life and you never know when they will reappear again  high schools ruff for this one reason   plus many more but still
love doesnt kill rejection does love is just here to cover it up like a bandaid hopin to fix a permenet scar
"b l o n d e \-brilliant, loving, opinionated, naughty, daring, eccentric\this is me"
omg it snowing wats up with tht
"says its so cold that there were penguins in my yard, until the polar bear chased them off!"
life is really a peice of work that i need to finish happy  i just hope it allows me to
