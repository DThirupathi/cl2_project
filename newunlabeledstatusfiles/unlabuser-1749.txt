"totally given up getting anything done for school    tyler wont sleep last night and he wont sleep now     still need to wash dishes,clean the house and put clothes away    test today   which is probably not gonna go over well"
finally got <propfirst> down for a nap   im so tired but hopefully i can get everything done
got a 99 on my first test   put all my flashcards in order   i need to study some more and clean the house then go to bed
"this first week of school has been very hard   i really didnt think it would be this much bad trying to balance school,a baby and taking care of a house is tiring  im sure i will get the <propfemale> out it soon but for now i'm just tired  just got done studying i had to stop cause the words started to look like there were mixed together  clean the house and took a shower and now i need to go to sleep  get <propfirst> in the a m"

i have a very bad headache and cant focus on school right now   i feel bad now that im in school i don't think i'm giving <propfirst> all the attention he needs   it's hard to play with him and let him run around outside while i try to study and get all my school stuff done   i need to find a time for both
got most of my school stuff done now i can go to bed   have to get up in about 6 hours to clean the house and go get <propfirst> at 11   tired and feeling not so hot   bed time finally   i wish i could get to bed at 11 like i use to
has been researching potty training   it seems like the  magic age is 18 months   it seems that kids that start at this age take to the potty the best   but some of the things they say to do are just stupid    i will totally be blogging about this on myspace when we start potty training
going to bed   hope <propfirst> sleeps well   got another a on my test last thursday and quiz today

watching dr phil about women that cant have babies and its so sad    i'll never understand why stupid people that dont want kids can get pregnant and women that really want babies cant    all i no is im very lucky to have my little man
we had are first potty training e playful erience today that did work out right but  i was still happy   we were in the bathroom and <propfirst> started to pull at his diaper so i took it off and he point down to his penis so i showed him the potty   well he walked away for a minute and then turned and started to run towards the potty and right before he got to it he peed  i just told him next time that is where his pee goes
sitting in keyboarding waiting to take my final   i have to wait till after break to take it which is still an hour and 20 minutes away and im bored  no one is ever on here to talk to

at home alone again    going to bed   i miss my little man
i hurt my foot like 3 days ago and it still hurts to walk on it
wondering if <propfirst> could actually be anymore annoying
i have bronchitis and i think i might die
getting ready to start class   its freakin cold outside   and i still have to go to the store after school
i have an hour ans 20 minutes left of school and have all my work done   so tired and i still have to go to the store for milk before i can go home

"finally have a wedding date pick out october 16, 2010   lots of things to do to get this planned"
just realized i was on seans facebook anyways going to look at a wedding chapel on friday

so first the house a few doors down gets shot up and then when i go in the hallway to  look and see whats going on me <propfirst> <propfirst> and <propfemale> all get locked out with both kids stuck in the house   a 4 year old and 18 month old what a good combination    i almost cried but <propfirst> and <propfirst> got the door opened and when we got inside both kids were still fast asleep
so tomorrow we put the deposits on the hall and chapel and then i can start working on everything else   school tomorrow night
wedding stuff   i still have 10 months and i already feel stressed out
so when i get home <propfirst> was sleeping but <propfirst> didn't change his clothes or give him a bath or brush his teeth  how hard is it to remember to give a baby a bath and put his p j's on
i want to dye my hair tonight
the bump on <propfirst> head is a lump of blood from his fall back in august that hardened and is going to eventually going to turn into bone and fuse with his skull
cant wait for finals to be over on thursday    then a 2 week break thank god
to scared to go to bed   i can't believe someone broke into the house   i just don't feel safe anymore

"i really hope 2010 is gonna get better because so far it has been pretty crap   everyone is sick, dying or has died   and the new year only started 18 days ago   but there are lots of things to look forward to like my wedding and finishing school"
just got back from melissa's  tyler is alittle sick  he had a fever earlier but its gone now and he was throwing up
it is 3 a m and i am up with <propfirst> watching cartoons    i haven't been a sleep yet    <propfirst> has a fever  dont no how high cause he will not let me take his temperture but when he pulled the thermometer out of his armpit it said 100 4
so its 4 smile 0 and were stilll up   tyler still have a fever but it is going down   i have found 3 new websites that im not addicted to   lamebook com   fmylife com and textsfromlastnight com
tylers finally went to bed at 5 and his fever was gone   when we woke up it was back   right now its 100 6 and he is throwing up again   now he has a cough too

ok if i hear one more person telling me how lucky was to have a c-section because they dont hurt im gonna seriously punch someone   they do hurt    really bad actually  and it hurts for a long time afterward   either way you have a baby it hurts
just watched pregnancy pact   i wanted to hit those girls in the face   anyone that gets pregnant on purpose when they no they have no way to support a baby is stupid   why would you try to bring another human into this world when you no you can't take care of it
waiting for <propfirst> to get home  i have alot i need to do i just dont feel like moving   well i better start cleaning soon
my head is pounding so mad    i think i might die   i just want to go to bed but i still have 5 hours of school

thinking about gonig back to school after i become an c<propfemale> to do the dialysis p  c  technician program   i would only have to complete the classes that i didn't take with the <propfemale> program   so it would only be another 3 months of school and a 6 week externship  then i would be a c<propfemale> and a dpct

i hate the hospitals but they were really nice   4 hours there tonight and it sucked   tyler has croup    i wish he didnt but at least it isn't as bad as when he had rsv
i hate this class so much  i really want to go home
<propfirst> is getting induced tomorrow at 7p m   i very excited
<propfirst> is getting induced tonight at 7  im so excited to see <propmale>
sitting in class waiting to hear <propfirst> tell me the baby is here
going shopping with <propfirst> and <propfirst>
<propfirst> has 4 cavities   two of them are really bad   so he has to have work done on them   on the 23rd he goes in to have the decay scraped out of his front two teeth and then have medication put in them   then 2 weeks later he has to have all four filled   my poor baby   they are gonna put him in something they call a sleeping bag so he cant move   i feel so bad for him
still working on homework
watching i didn't no i was pregnant   i still get freaked out when i watch this cause i just keep thinking a few more weeks and that would have been me  i dont even no what i would do if that happened to me
easiest final ever tonight   happy that class is over    another final tomorrow and then the weekend thank god  
hoping my hair dont fall out cause im dying it for the three time today   having dark hair sucks nothing shows up   going shopping tomorrow and then going out with <propfirst> at night as long as <propfirst> will stay with my mom
guess im dying my hair yet again   sean just told me my hair is bright red which its not   but anyways going shopping and then out tonight
i really need a stove   mine has been broken for like 3 months so that gives me two choices when i cook   i can have food that is burned or raw   neither one tastes good
5 and a half months left till im done with school   it seems like forever
taking <propfirst> to <propfirst>'s for a little while so i can get some more stuff for the wedding   then i have to study
another night terror  tyler woke up screaming  it went on for about 15 minutes   he wouldn't snap out of it no matter how hard i tried to help  even when he finally opened his eyes he was still screaming and his eyes looked weird  i really wish these night terrors would end
i dont wanna go out in this snow but i have to    going to get my bc and then to my moms   waiting to see if school reopens
<propfirst> did really good at the dentist today   the nurse said he only cried a little and that he was a good boy    they put medicine in his two front teeth and he goes back in 3 weeks for the 4 fillings
wednesday i need people with good veins to let me draw their blood  i need to have 3 more good blood draws by tomorrow or i cant pass the class  i think it is so stupid that they have a class of 20 when we all need 6 blood draws in 3 classes  it is not possible in my opinion
all my blood draws are done thank god

"dear god, i was wondering if it was possible for you to give me a 5 minute break before you throw yet another thing i can't handle at me  the end  so now my refridgeator is broken and the stove is broken  being stressed 24 7 isn't really working for me "
taking <propfirst> to the dentist in the morning
poor baby the medicine in <propfirst>'s front two teeth did not take  so they put more medicine in this teeth and if it still doesn't take they have to pull his teeth

"i traded eyeliner for dark circles, salon  hair cuts for ponytails & hairclips, long showers for hairy legs,  late nights for early mornings, designer purses for diaper bags, and i  wouldn't change a thing! with mother's day drawing near, let's see how  many moms repost this  moms don't mind making sacrifices and will continue to give things up for their kids    that is true love "
going to get tylers 2 year pictures done today
so freakin tired   just got <propfirst> to sleep and now im getting ready for bed

having a hard time getting to sleep tonight
taking <propfirst> to the zoo today
uploading pictures o f <propfirst> for the zoo today   there arent actually alot of <propfirst> because <propfirst> was to into all the animals    
it would be really nice if people were more considerate  i think when two people are in a relationship it should be there decision what is or is not done during that relationship i think i should be shown some respect seeing how i am the tylers mother   me and <propfirst> will decide what is okay for us and you should worry about keeping private things (like peoples phone numbers)private 
stuck in horrible traffic on 94
is it just me or have we been tested more in the last week then we have in 4 years   i dont no what it was but im happy everything seems to be over    and if not i still have some fight left in me   but hopefully thing are gonna calm down for awhile
according to the dr  <propmale> show today a stay at home mom works the equivalent of two full time jobs    i couldnt agree more
yet another trip to the doctors with tyler   this boy is accident prone i swear   i thought he broke his foot but he is okay
at the movies with <propfirst> seeing grown ups
i lost all my <propfirst> even though they were saved to my sim card when i moved then to the new phone   so i need everyones <propfirst>
ok i figured it out and i have all my <propfirst>
wonderful another 14 minutes till im another year older  i dont want to have a birthday  well i guess ready or not here comes 23  yay not
happy birthday to me    but <propfirst> said its his birthday not mommas
thanks from all the happy birthday comments    thank god its over for a year cause birthdays arent fun anymore  now they just mean im getting old
stuck in traffic on 94 again   with very little gas   guess i should have gonna some before i tried going home
on my way home i seen seven cars pulled over   so i actually went the speed limit today
making another attempt to shop tomorrow   we will see how <propfirst> feels about that  he is so spoiled   he got one toy from every story we went into today   probably not a great habit to start
<propfirst> doesnt want to go shopping today
at coreys to do fireworks
<propfirst> sprained his knee
<propfirst> still cant walk today   he stood for a few seconds and he will crawl
had alot of fun last night    
got to take <propfirst> back to the doctor tomorrow cause he till cant walk right yet   he was just there two weeks ago cause he hurt his foot   there gonna think i beat this kid
took <propfirst> back to the doctor today   said it looks like he just twisted it wrong   he said to give it a few more days and come back if there is no improvement
"finally its not 100 out    cleaning the house, making dinner, and doing homework"
im partying it up here on friday night   just got done with some awesome bath time and next up were gonna rock out with a book  and then it is night night time   i no i no im just so hardcore
"so <propfirst> went to bed at 9 smile 0 and i just finished cleaning out his toys   now i have to do dishes, put clothes away and clean the house for the third time today    atleast im never bored"
really wish i could take <propfirst> to the doctors tomorrow   i think there is something seriously wrong with his leg   its been a week and he can only walk if his leg is turned sideways   thats not normal   ive been to the doctor and to the er and they both said its a sprain   if it is then again why cant he walk normal and why is his leg turned freakin sideways
pretty annoyed today but whatever    <propfirst> played outside with his uncle <propfirst> today and he didnt even get hurt lol j k <propfirst>    to the doctors again tomorrow to see why he still cant walk
going to the doctors with <propfirst> at 2 smile 0 for his leg again   something is so not right with the way he walks   when he runs it looks like his hip is out of place
had more xrays done on tylers hip   im scared of what might be wrong   doctor will call inthe morning
if god never gives you more then you can handle why does it seem like im way in over my head

getting up early to take <propfirst> to blakes
went to blakes today   tyler had alot of fun   that little boy makes me tired
getting a cold   im about to make dinner and clean

<propfirst> has been using the potty on and off for about two months   but last week we started using a potty chart and today he got his first sticker for his potty chart
little update about <propfirst> for people that don't no yet    he went to probation for the first time today to start his 3 years probation  he will most likely be sentenced from macomb county in december   the lawyer said the best outcome for that will be 1 year in county jail and the worst will be somewhere around 4 years in prison
watching tv and just learn that 20% of all marriages are between cousins   that is pretty gross
10 minute break before started to clean again
graduation tonight    but instead of going im gonna go to dinner with my family   
dropping <propfirst> off with my mom and then going out for sweetest day
"did alot yesterday  me and <propfirst> went to lunch then to sammies    after that we went and played pool, rented movies and went to dinner  tyler made cards for poeple yesterday for sweetest day"
this week is mommy week  post the date and time you became a mommy  <propfirst> <propfirst> birdwell  4lbs 15oz at 10 smile 5 pm on may 5th 2008 
watching hocus pocus with <propfirst>
"me, <propfirst> and <propfirst> know how to party  we just had a ball fight with the balls from <propfirst>s cozy car ball pit   i used the cozy car as a shield and barricaded myself in <propfirst>s room    <propfirst> went back and forth between mine and <propfirst>'s team   he stoled all the balls i had saved up and gave them to <propfirst>"
"put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure, they are looking for acceptance and equal rights  93% won't copy and paste this  will       you make it your status for at least    one hour? promote love & acceptance! not hate  period "
so we have court again on the 29th   not sure if there gonna offer <propfirst> a plea deal or not   if they do he will be sentenced right around christmas    kinda ready to get this over with even though it means <propfirst> will be going away for awhile    i think waiting for him to go is worse then the thought of him actually being gone
"if you have a brother who has made you laugh, pulled your hair, stuck up for you, drove you crazy, hugged you, watched you succeed, saw you fall (or tripped you), picked you back up, cheered you on, made you strong, took your bike apart and never put it back together, and you love him with all of your heart, then copy    & paste this to your status"
"so <propfirst> was making something to eat and said the butter was to hard so he had to melt it a little    a few minutes later i go back in the kitchen and <propfirst> says \i had to let the butter get hard again cause it melted all the way   i don't no why i only put in in the microwave for one minute\""   how did he live the first 24 years of his life without me"""

"i loved you the minute i heard your heartbeat  i loved you the minute you were born  then i saw your face and fell in love some more  you were only a minute old but i knew i would die for you, and to this day i still would  when you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body  put this on your status if you have children you love more than life!"

taking a break from my day of cleaning to eat while <propfirst> takes his nap
i asked <propfirst> to hand me the paper towel and he asked where it was  so i said on the table   his response was oh ok momma   i said you know you're so cute and he said you're so cute too momma   i think i have the cutest little boy in the world

i just spent 20 minutes dry heaving   how can two pregnancies be so different   i feel like crap and my back hurts now   
seriously i really feel like im dying today   this is like the worst i have ever felt   i just wanna go to sleep
dear child inside of me    we have to come to some kind of agreement    i have to be able to keep some of the food i eat inside of my body
<propfirst> has been asleep for an hour and a half and <propfirst> just fell asleep  now it is time for me and baby chicken to watch sex in the city 2

slammed my finger in the car door today and it really hurts
why am i up right now when <propfirst> will be sleeping till 7 smile 0
stood in line for 2 hours at the roseville tree lighting so <propfirst> could see <propfemale> even though he is gonna see him again next week   the things we do for our kids    oh and seriously if your over the age of 8 you do not need to sit on <propfemale>'s lap
so i was up all night last night cause not only was i sharing the bed with <propfirst> the bed cover hog but i also had <propfirst> who moves all night in there and his guitar which he refused to sleep without
just made cupcakes with <propfirst>
now <propfirst> is running around saying i come in peace   my kid is so weird
finally done cleaning    i've been at it for 5 hours and <propfirst> should be home soon thank god cause <propfirst> is driving me nuts
god <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change; courage to change the things i can;and wisdom to know the difference 
going to the doctors tomorrow finally and i will be able to set up an ultrasound
doctors appointment at 1:15   i should be able to hear the heartbeat today  it sucks that <propfirst> can't be there with me but hopefully he can make it to one appointment before he goes away
so i went to the doctors today   they think im 17 weeks and gave me a due date of may 10th    im high risk agian this time   and i lost 3 pounds so suck it pregnancy im not gonna get fat this time
so <propfirst> took a plea deal today    he plead guilty to two attempts to sell esctasy 2 counts of selling vicodin and 1 count of selling weed    the maximum is gonna be 7 years and the minimum is 2 years but it is possible for him to get 1 year in county jail   sentencing is <propfirst> 11th
i hate 24 hour this stupid 24 hour urine test    you no how hard it is to remember i have to pee into something everytime i go to the bathroom all day long
so if my doctors office opens at 9 shouldn't they have there answering service off by 9:17    really annoying

dear morning sickness please can you go away and stay away   im getting sick of this coming and going crap
happy <propfirst> is gonna to have a brother or sister soon cause he spends his day talking to himself and playing games by himself  its a little sad
feeling like shit and <propfirst> is not being helpful
feeling crappy again today   why do i still have morning sickness at 18 weeks
i have a freakin bacterial infection  doctor is putting me on antibiotics   i thought it was a little funny that the nurse was trying to reassure me that it wasn't and std   i wasn't really worried about having one of those lol
going to bed with <propfirst> cause i feel like crap
how can i be so tired all day and up all night
have to get motivated to clean up tylers toys today   i haven't cleaned his toy room in a week cause there is no where to walk in there
just ate a half a bag of dove peanut butter chocolates for a snack before lunch lol   im just so freakin hungry
"so let me get this straight   larry <propmale> is getting his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for a 9th time, <propfemale> spears had a 55 hour marriage, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods, while married, were having sex with everyone, yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage?? really?!?!?! repost to your <propfemale> if you agree ? proud to support equal rights for all ?"
went to bed at 9 smile 0 last night   and i was still tired when i woke up
how was my day   first my phone charger stopped working and then my computer charger broke   i went to drain my meat for dinner and spilled all of it in the sink  i burned myself while cooking and i think <propfirst> was more hyper then ever   can't wait till 9 smile 0 so i can take a long peaceful bath
at some point in this pregnancy i have to start feeling better   right?
woke up hungry  seriously i don't think i ever stop eating    i don't wanna be hungry anymore
had a dream about some pie and now im gonna have to go buy some
"so seen million dollar money drop and this is what i have to say  if <propfirst> had us bet all the money we won so far 800,000 dollars on an answer that he said he knew was 100 percent right but it turned out to be wrong    im telling you right now i would kill him   and i hope the women on the show does the same to her husband"
channel 4 is outside my house   to bad its cause the house a few doors down got shot up   seriously people its 4 smile 0 in the morning
going to <propfemale>'s in a little bit
went through the attic to make room to put tylers old toys up  we cleared a nice amount of space for tylers new toys
<propfirst> got alot of great presents  can't wait till tomorrow to see his face
watching a christmas story and getting ready to go to bed   going to my dad's and then mom's tomorrow

feeling sick agian    hopefully it will pass
me and <propfirst> are both sick
going shopping to see what we can get for this baby   it would be way easier if i knew what i was having
"so we spent about 300 dollars today but we got so much stuff  bassinet, swing chair, bouncer chair, tummy time gym,a dresser, diaper bag,play pen, bassinet sheets, <propmale>, exersaucer   happy we got so much  only a few things to get later"
getting ready for the doctor today at 11   gotta ask her why i have shooting pains on my left side all the time and what i can do about being sick 24 7
i had to have another ultrasound cause they couldn't find the heartbeat again and cause i haven't gained any weight  doctor said the baby looks like a healthy 20 week baby   and she also said that she is pretty sure the baby is a girl but when the baby did a flip she saw something that could have been a penis   i'll no for sure on the 5th
watching someone drink alcohol on tv just made me sick
actually really excited for tomorrow    going to an early dinner and then to see little fockers   after that heading to <propfirst>'s
oh heartburn how i have missed you since my last pregnancy   im so happy your back
thankfully <propfirst> went to bed early cause now everything is done and i can sleep
"so happy to be done with 2010   this year was full of disappointment,loss and struggle   in 2011 even though <propfirst> will be leaving i think that things will be better   this new year i will welcome another baby as well as watch my older baby turn 3   and <propfirst> might even get to come home at the end of the year"
<propfirst> just told me that everyone is pregnant
not feeling good today    hoping <propfirst> is good tomorrow at the dentist and has no cavities   then the next day is my ultrasound   hopefully the baby gives us a good shot so we know 100 percent what we are having
gotta get up early to take <propfirst> to the dentist
getting ready to take <propfirst> to the dentist   he already cried about it once so i hope its not to bad   and <propfirst> may have anger issues  he just told me he wanted to hurt <propfemale>
<propfirst> has two cavities that he has to have filled   this time they are gonna sedate him so i have to pay a freakin 70 dollar fee
morning sickness is back and its pissed off   got sick 6 times today
i love my kids but never will i get pregnant again ever   throw up about 12 times now
hoping to god that im gonna keep this food down and wishing i could sleep
please god let me eat some food and keep it done    leaving for my ultrasound soon   and this better be a girl cause im not doing this again
doctor was wrong by 6 weeks   im only 14 weeks   to early to tell the sex   and the reason im showing so much is because this is my second they said
i still feel like complete crap   so im gonna lay down till its time to go to <propfirst>'s and hopefully <propfirst> will watch <propfirst>    these hormones are really getting to me  i started crying at target like a crazy person
so i deleted my post on accident but my new due date is july 3rd
going to my moms house soon i hope so i can watch some tv

"craving eggs, sausage and hash browns so <propfirst> went to the store to get some for me"
having a hard time today  i guess things really just hit me within the last hour  tyler hasn't left <propfirst>'s side all day  its like he knows something is wrong
just watched <propfirst> say bye to <propfirst>
gonna try to go to sleep  just ready to get tomorrow over with and go pick <propfirst> up   i don't plan on talking to many people tomorrow i just wanna spend time with <propfirst>
not even sure why i put makeup on  its already coming off with my tears  i know im not a very religious person but i do know there is a god and everything that happens he has a reason for

so far <propfirst>'s release date is feb  2nd  he can still get out earlier then that though
finally things are starting to feel okay again    i have lots of people to write back tonight    doctors appointment at 4 tomorrow
doctors today    so the doctors and the ultrasound have now completely confirmed that my official due date july 4th   still haven't gained any weight   actually lost another pound
so last night was my first time ever sleeping somewhere all alone   i had plans to get stuff done last night but i fell asleep at 10 so that didn't work out
"do i work? uh, yeah i work  24 hours a day, 7 days a week  why? because i'm a mom  i'm a cook, a cleaner, a teacher, a referee, a nanny, a nurse, a handyman, a maid, a security officer, a photographer, a counselor, a chauffeur and a comforter  i don't get holidays, sick pay or any days off  i work through the day and night  i am on call all hours  tell me your job is harder than mine  post if you are a proud mom! smile "
i am frickin starving again   and i think i have an addiction to pizza rolls   seriously they are the only thing i like eating and the only thing that never gave me morning sickness
half way done with my midnight cleaning spree
its 1:45 in the morning and i just finished the cleaning   now tomorrow all i have to do is clean my room and the landing yay    eating some more pizza rolls and writing an email then hopeful going to bed   oh and i have scared the crap out of myself about 1000 times tonight   i seriously don't do good alone lol
waiting for the damn doctor to call to see when my ultrasound is so i know when we are going to find out what we are having
i swear i think my doctors office is full of complete morons   you tell me you'll call by noon with my ultrasound date   and if you don't call i should call you  while i just called cause it's after noon and you still don't have my freaking ultrasound time   and i swear the <propfemale>'s there are so bitchy   and the lady i just talked to must want me to kick her in her face cause she has an attitude
thanks for calling me back about my ultrasound   i swear these people are so stupid   and now there closed till monday   i seriously want to switch my doctor
so at least the doctors office will answer my moms questions    now i have to wait for monday to find out what day my ultrasound will be
<propfirst> being gone is finally hitting <propfirst>   he just told me i miss daddy and i want him   thank god it will only be a couple more weeks

i've been up since 5 smile 0 cause this baby hates me   i haven't slept all night in almost 5 months  let me sleep child
getting up at 5 smile 0 was a bad idea   praying for it to be 10 smile 0 so <propfirst> will take a nap

my food is almost done and then i can eat   this kid has me so freakin hungry

been cleaning for 3 hours and have 3 rooms done   i think im making good time   only 3 rooms left
took a cleaning break to eat lunch    but i don't think cookie dough and pizza rolls were such a good idea   now my stomach hurts

"just finished cleaning   me and <propfirst> were jammin out to backstreet boys while we worked   his new favorite song   \if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy\"""""

why is this day going by so slow   seans visit isn't till 1
in my car outside the jail wait to go in   i always get here to early
im so freaking tired today  cant wait to go to bed
"kentucky just passed the best law ever  to be on foodstamps, medicaid, cash assistance for your children or yourself  you have to pass a drug test  now every other state should do the same! if you agree re-post  people that work have to take a drug test so should they"
dumb people should not be allowed to have children   just  because a boy plays with girl toys it does not make he gay and if a little girl plays with boy toys there not a lesbian   i mean seriously people are just so closed minded
at my brothers house waiting on the pizza to get here
going home soon   haven't been there in a few days
<propfirst>'s taking a bath because we had a bit of an accident here   potty training is not working out
<propfirst> comes home in 63 hours
so pissed right now i just missed <propfirst>'s phone call
"it's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship  these friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don't hold grudges they understand that life is busy  but you will always love them  repost if you have at least 1 of these friends, they will know who they are"
feeling crappy today but at least i get to go see <propfirst> tomorrow and then he gets out   i really hope we don't get the sown storm    news just said were gonna get between 12-18 inches
3 rooms clean 3 more and the landing to go    <propfirst> is at my grandmas tonight and i really miss him  its been just me and him for the last month so its pretty lonely when he is gone   on a good note 36 hours till <propfirst> comes home
so happy that i get to go out in a blizzard to get <propfirst> when he is released    i have no idea how im doing this
getting ready to go see <propfirst> for the last time   19 hours till he comes home   but only 9 hours till the blizzard starts
i don't no why i get nervous everytime i go see <propfirst>    leaving to see him now
<propfirst>  just called he gets out at midnight so only 7 hours till he comes home
really not looking forward to driving in this weather   would it be wrong to make <propfirst> walk home lol
seriously how am i hungry again
<propfirst> has not left <propfirst>'s side yet
i cant wait for american idol
<propfirst> fell asleep on the couch and when i went to move him into his bed he jumped up and yelled where is my daddy    i don't think <propfirst> is ever getting away from him again
i just ate a whole box of rainbow cookies   i can't stop eating
can't wait for the packers to win so i can prove <propfirst> wrong again
the packers won just like i said
feeling sick today    going to bed as soon as <propfirst> does
doctors tomorrow   hoping the doctor will tell me what i'm having   if not i have to wait till my ultrasound at the hospital next week
"it's nieces week! if you have a beautiful niece or nieces that you\love more than you can describe, copy and paste this to your\status for a little while, but hold them in your heart for a lifetime!"
i just read someones facebook status and almost peed on myself
so halfway through my pregnancy and i only gained one pound yay me   this was the first time they didnt have to do a ultrasound to get the heartbeat   im measuring right at 19 weeks and the heartbeat was 149   
cleaning up while <propfirst> is at probation and then going to get <propfirst>    4 days until my ultrasound
its 7:25 and <propfirst> is passed out   im gonna be up at 5 smile 0 in the morning
washing clothes all day    <propfirst> is going to see yogi bear with his meema and going to jeepers
ive been washing clothes since 10 in the morning and i still have some waiting to go into the washer   on a happy note only 2 days till i find out the sex of the baby
making <propfirst> sleep in his room for the first time in 6 months and im freaking out about it
12 hours till i find out the sex of the baby   it would be nice if it was a girl but i really really feel like its a boy
heartburn please go away
just gave <propfirst> his vday gift and now its bed time up early for my ultrasound
exchanged gifts with <propfirst> last night for vday   i have something small to give <propfirst> too   and i find out what im having in an hour and a half
never watch a women give birth   even if it is your second child
its a girl
it's been a great valentines day   found out im having a girl   got cards from <propfirst> and <propfirst>   me and <propfirst> just made cupcakes and we are getting ready to frost them soon
we were given: two hands to hold  two legs to walk  two eyes to see  two ears to listen  but why only one heart? because the other was given to someone else  for us to find
so the paci is gone for good   everyone pray for me lol  and tomorrow we start working hard on potty training
<propfirst> used his potty today   and he even told me when he needed to go    he is still pretty mad that i took his paci but its not as bad as i thought it would be
starting to plan stuff out for <propfirst>'s birthday party   so far all i no is its gonna be may 7th
not only did i ate my breakfast as well as finishing tylers left overs but i just ate the rest of my rainbow cookies   pregnant or not i think i went over board lol
so i wasn't gonna do a bounce house for <propfirst>'s birthday this year but he really wants one    so now im looking up bounce house rentals    so everyone can get excited cause there will be a bounce house after all   just wish it didn't cost 200 dollars to rent one
got some clothes for the baby today and getting some more stuff tomorrow    i think it was easier shopping for a boy
just got done shopping for more baby clothes    putting the new bedding on the crib and cleaning then taking <propfirst> to my grandmas later so me and <propfirst> can go to dinner and a movie
so we paid for <propfirst>'s bounce house 3 months ahead of time so we could save 20 dollars lol   he is having a batman party this year
im wearing my flip flops today and pretty soon i can go buy some new sunglasses
so i have everything for tylers birthday already    only thing left to do is get the food and cake when its time for the party  oh and wait the 3 months till his party
is pissed that my internet doesnt work cause some dumb ass wanted to start a fire a few houses down
i need my internet fixed   stupid at&t when the hell are you coming
yay the internet is back on after 3 days    to tired to do anything right now   just getting ready to go to bed
american idol and then bed   when will i stop being tired all the time
only one room left to clean but i don't wanna move    i think ill just sit here with my chocolate and wait till <propfirst> wakes up to finish cleaning
<propfirst> starts work tomorrow   thank god cause he was starting to annoy me  wonder how he is gonna like getting up at 5 in the morning
"so im stuck on baby names   its between adalyn grace, briella <propfemale> and mia <propfemale>"
morning sickness has been coming back lately   this little girl doesn't like food at all
so <propfirst> woke up at 1:45 this morning cause he got a text message and thought it was his alarm to go to work lol    at least he realized it before he got ready for work 3 hours early
<propfirst> is finally on his way home  waiting for the lasagna to be done cause im freaking hungry
lots of laundry to do today and then if there is enough time me and <propfirst> are gonna see hall pass
so as of right now we are going to name the baby mia <propfemale>
hall pass was really funny   i learned some new words during the movie too
making dinner and writing a list of all the things i want to clean tomorrow    i have some serious nesting going on
internet is out again   i hate at&t
watching coming home and then going to bed
so much cleaning to do today   at least once the new baby comes i will have a reason to have a messy house for a couples weeks
"i just hit the 6 month <propfirst> in my pregnancy and now all the sudden i feel like im dying   i can't sleep, my back hurts, and i feel like a whale   my first pregnancy was so much easier"
taking a break from cleaning to eat lunch and relax while <propfirst> is taking a nap
finally finished cleaning    i think i have ocd cause i clean everyday for 3 to 4 hours and my house is not big  im so tired today  ill just sit right here till its time to make dinner
i want mcdonalds breakfest
went for my 6 month check up today   baby is doing good and measuring just right   i only gained 5 pounds so far   i have another ultrasound next week to see how the baby is growing
time to start cleaning for the day
so happy to be done cleaning   nothing to do now till dinner time   so ready for tylers nap in 15 minutes
omg im not gonna make it another 3 months   i can't move cause my back hurts so bad and my stomach feels so heavy im pretty sure that im starting to waddle
laying down while <propfirst> and <propfirst> play video games
me <propfirst> and <propfirst> were up late last night fixing some mistakes   thank god i got some decaf coffee at the store yesterday cause its like my replacement cigarette since i got pregnant   lots of cleaning and potty training today
respect: to show consideration for; treat courteously or kindly
<propfirst> is taking a nap and i get to eat lunch in peace
<propfirst> found a way to stay up 15 minutes passed his bed time    he tells <propfirst> that he's hungry cause he knows <propfirst> will feed him  even though we both no he isn't hungry
going to my moms today cause i have another ultrasound tomorrow and no car now that <propfirst> is working  i hope no one is having a baby tomorrow cause then im gonna have to wait forever for an ultrasound
i selpt in till 8 this morning and im still tired
i feel like i should just move in to my doctors office since im gonna be there all the time now   my regular doctors appointments are every 2 weeks now and i have to have an ultrasound every 4 weeks
no coffee today since im at my moms   ultrasound at 1
"why did i teach <propfirst> to talk   its not fun arguing with a 2 1 2 year old especially when he wins most of the time  but it is pretty funny to hear him say \say your prayers\"" before he shoots me with his machine gun"""
"so today <propfirst> said \ break it down\"" and then started to do his form of break dancing   my kid is so weird"""
really thinking about getting up at 6 smile 0 so i can have a cup of coffee in peace
its st  patricks day    gotta find something green for my little <propfemale> boy to wear
<propfirst> just told me he wants to wear his underwear   he thinks putting on spider man underwear makes him turn into spider man
gotta start cleaning but i really dont want to   i want some frosting
finally the house is clean now i can relax till its time to make dinner  tyler is still napping i think i should wake him up its been 2 1 2 hours
dear bed time i love you more than anything in the world  only 45 minutes till tylers bed time thank god im worn out 
"<propfirst> keeps calling <propfirst> \daddy <propfirst>\"""""
i was attacked by my vacuum today   i swear i think some things only happen to me lol   hopefully <propfirst> can fix the vacuum when he gets home cause i think i might have broke it more when i tired to fix it lol
i got a new vacuum today yay me
i seriously need to get out   i have been stuck in my house 24 7 since <propfirst> started working
fu potty training i really hate you    tyler just doesnt want to use the potty   
why does this baby like kicking me so much   i swear people probably think im crazy cause i jump every time she kicks me   based on the way my pregnancies have gone im gonna say that this baby is gonna be nothing like her brother    thank god cause the world is not ready for another <propfirst>
i think that the new car seat rules are really stupid   i don't think that kids should have to be rear facing till 2   and seriously making kids ride in a high back booster seat till there 4 foot 9 or 12 years old really
so i have tried every way possible to potty train <propfirst> and it has not worked  he is so stubborn   so next week when i have no where to go for the whole week we are gonna try the naked method   this is my last resort    i have never hated something as much as i hate potty training
you know what is really annoying   waking someone up four times to let them know that its getting late and they need to get there stuff ready for work in the morning only to hear them say there not sleeping there just resting there eyes    last time i checked when you rest your eyes you don't snore
no more chinese food till after i have this baby  it gives me way to much heart burn
gonna try to go to bed but this baby is kicking non stop so i don't no if that is gonna happen or not
i have to send tylers birthday invitations out soon   i really hate writing them out and <propfirst> makes fun of my cause i write like a 5 year old   tyler will be 3 in 6 weeks   and 3 years ago today i didn't even know i was pregnant yet lol
i have some serious ocd cleaning going on today    nesting like crazy
i just cleaned out tylers closet and got rid of 2 garbage bags full of his 2t clothes that don't fit him anymore   now im hoping i can get rid of all the toys he doesn't play with while he takes his nap  
well i got one garbage bag full of toys good but there is still a lot  relaxing while <propfirst> naps and then finishing the cleaning
omg i am so sore   i just cleaned for 7 hours    and i mean i did some serious cleaning   i think i might have done alittle to much though cause now my stomach and back are killing me   thank god <propfirst> is gonna go stay at my grandmas tonight so i don't have to drop him off in the morning before the doctor
"if your babyâ€™s â€œbeautiful and perfect, never cries or fusses, sleeps on schedule and burps on demand, an angel all the time,â€� youâ€™re the grandma"
so freaking tired im going to bed   doctors tomorrow for my check up and gd test   i hate that stuff you have to drink  hopefully this time it wont make me wanna throw up
ok so its 2:24 a m and im still awake   im so tired and i can't sleep   tyler is with my grandma tonight so it would be the perfect night to rest if i could ever fall asleep
"<propfirst> should never try to make a pregnant person feel better lol   last night i was upset cause i look like a freaking whale now and seans exact words were \you're not fat your stomach is just big\""  that really didn't make me feel better but at least it made me laugh cause he sounded so stupid"""
just did my gd test   now i have to wait another 50 minutes to get my blood drawn
so the doctors went good today   baby is in the 78th percentile   did my gd test and didnt want to throw up this time   so far i have only gained 7 pounds with 15 weeks left to go
<propfirst> is finally sleeping  it only took 15 minutes for him to fall asleep tonight  so i decided anyone with more then two kids has to be freaking nuts   at the end of the night im so tired i feel like i can't move  so i don't no how anymore could take care of 2 or 3 kids while being pregnant
enjoying the few minutes of peace with my cup of coffee while <propfirst> sleeps
completely surprised that <propfirst> is still sleeping at 9 a m
looking forward to the weekend   i love <propfirst> but its gonna be nice to just relax for a day
really don't feel good at all   so ready for july so i can get this baby out
it would be really nice if i could take a nice hot bath at the end of a long stressful day but <propfirst> and <propfirst> used all the hot water   so i got to take yet another quick cold bath
"dear mia, your mother is gonna have a hard time getting through the doorway if you don't stop with these constant cravings  also im tired and your brother gets up at 7 a m so can you go to sleep for the night and stop moving around so much so that i can get some sleep "
feels like crap and <propfirst> is being a brat
today i will not clean lol   ok well maybe just a little but not like i normally do   i think i have been over doing it lately so im gonna try to just relax for a few days
"so the doctor just called   my platelets dropped again   there only 49,000 now so i have to be put on steroids to try to get them up    plus i failed my gd test so  i have to go back for the 3 hour one   the steroids are gonna make but blood sugars go up anyway so now im gonna have to be put on a diabetic diet   probably gonna be late to the reception tonight now"
<propfirst> and <propfemale> had a really nice reception   it sucks that i felt to sick to really enjoy it   plus with everything i found out today i was just in a bad mood  so happy to be going to bed now
i dont no what this crazy baby is doing but she just made the weirdest move and i almost peed on myself lol   i no that by the time this pregnancy is over i will have peed on myself at least once
i have been running around so much this weekend    yesterday me and <propfirst> spent all day shopping for the new baby   we got alot of new clothes   its a little depressing though cause we have been shopping for this baby since january and we still need tons of clothes  going through tylers old clothes soon cause i know we have some neutral stuff in there
almost got in an accident today cause people can't drive    i hate when dumb ass people don't look before they try to get over
so i found away a way to get <propfirst> to use his potty    when i know he has to go i sit him on his potty and let him play a game or watch tv and he goes    he was so excited that he peed in his potty today
watching my soul to take then going to bed  i think <propfirst> was a little tried cause he fell asleep in about 5 minutes tonight   normally it takes about 20 minutes of me yelling go to bed
"dear dumb <propfemale>'s that work at my doctors office, once 8 smile 0 comes and your office opens your supposed to turn your answering service off and actual answer the calls from patients "
so today i told <propfirst> that they don't make diapers anymore  he wore underwear all day and only used pull ups at nap time and bed time    he had some accidents but he also used his potty 4 times today
<propfirst> is doing so good with his potty training now    he even tells me when he has to use the potty  hope he keeps it up
doctors tomorrow at 10 smile 0 to talk about my platelets and see if they went up or not   and i have to set up a 3 hour gd test
doctors at 10 smile 0   i hate sitting there by myself  hopefully its only good news
so no accidents for <propfirst> today and he used his potty twice
decided with the doctor today to do a repeat c-section    ill be scheduling it around my 34 week and delivering during my 39th week    so sometime between june 27th and july 3rd she will be here as long as everything goes as planned
"<propfirst> <propfirst> birdwell, may 5th, 2008, 36 weeks, 4lbs 15oz , 18 inches long, born at 10 smile 5 p m ? if your a proud mama repost with name, date, length of pregnancy, labor time, baby weight, height and time"
so i need everyones address cause im sending out tylers birthday party invitations in a few days
so proud of <propfirst> its 8 smile 0 and still no accidents   he used his potty all day
i know i said this last night but i need everyones address cause im sending out tylers invitations this weekend
another day with no accidents for <propfirst>
