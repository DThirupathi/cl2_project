"i think i've just about got my ballot figured out  not counting candidates running unopposed, i'll be voting for two republicans, two libertarians, and nine democrats  i pride myself on being an independent minded, moderate voter, but this is the most lopsided ballot i've ever had  but considering the gains the gop is bound to make, especially with the tea party influence this year, i'd say it's justified "
