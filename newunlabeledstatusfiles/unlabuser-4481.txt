"if you love someone you would be willing to give up everything for them, but if they loved you back they'd never ask you to  they say loving you gives pains and full of sacrifices  but i'd rather take pains and lots of sacrifices than not to be loved by you  a wise girl kisses but doesn't love, listens but doesnt believe, and leaves before she is left   i guess i'm stupid "
"if i know what love is, it is because of you - to the world you are one person, but to one person you are the world-  let's commit the perfect crime, i'll steal your heart and you'll steal mine - you are what i never knew and what i always wanted "
"once a long, long time ago, all people had 4 legs and 2 heads, then the gods threw down thunder bolts and split everyone into two  each of them had 2 legs and 1 head, but the separation left both sides with a desperate yearning to be re-united because they each shared the same soul  and ever since then, all people spend their lives searching for the other half of their soul "
love is just a word until you find someone to give it a definition
