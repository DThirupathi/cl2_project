"that ticking noise you hear that sounds like a leak,\water to tin and over again \the song that's played,\with poetic words \speaking brightly,\of morbid death \\yes,\that noise is what i speak of \you wonder what it is?\then come closer to my chest,\and louder it'll get \because it's the sound,\of my broken soul \it's been that way for a while,\but it's repeating it's song \hoping someone will listen,\and know "
"so what am i left with when my entire sense of belonging is severed at the ends? \where do i go, when every home i've ever known has changed,\when my existance there ends  \if i've ever felt more alone i think i would've known,\that my place in the world was erased by time and i'm left standing with no where to run, and no where to hide  \and i'm still wondering,\where am i?"
