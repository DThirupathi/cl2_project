"2   many think <propfemale> means we can buy, use, and throw out anything we want  when in fact this very attitude has enslaved us  not only has it gotten many citizens in debt beyound any hope, but has also made us dependent on other nations who do not have our intersts in mind  <propfemale> means we can worship the way we want, own property, partener up with whom we want, help community the way we want "
3   with the economy being in a downward spiral the fed gov sometimes have to create wealth jobs and and stimualte the econ  this means there will be budget shortfalls  so what  it is not in usa interest to have massive <propfirst> poor folks living in boxes is it?

"obama's speech was very good  i don't like the idea that a member of congress shouted liar in the middle of his speech  if you agree with him or not as a member of congress you should at least respect the prez or any guest in the chamber speaking  it was not wise and i think this plus school house cracked buisness thii week, failing to see their input into the econ collapse, having nothing new to add hurts gop  good "

"<propfirst> <propmale> said what? perhaps the truth perhaps not i am not sure but what i do know is that there were loads of signs that questioned the prez on several trivial issues  some of these being where he was born, if he is an space alien, and something stupid about being an afircan lion  there were also implications about his safety such as this tme we did not bring guns and bury him etc "

"just remember no matter which side you are on in the health care reform debate according to a cbo report by 2018  the mean cost for a family of four to be covered is going to be $25,000+  so when the health insurance industry tries to scare folks with their latest study of higher costs if reform goes through they are really  now just telling you they are going to raise rates either way  what a bogus study!"

can someone please tell me one job that was created by the bush tax cut program?  can anyone tell me in one way how the bush tax cuts helped our economy in a sestemic way? can one person tell me how our nation is more competitve in any fundamental way due to the bush tax cuts?  i am not trying to be provocative but really let's get real

it has been 107 years since the tour de <propfemale> started  in the early days the race was about 2400 km long and there were 6 stages in all   the average length of any stage was 400km + ( 250+ <propmale>)  
the first true high mountain pass in the tour de <propfemale> was in 1910 when the tour passes over the col du galibier   at the time the pass was about 2556 meters high or or approximately 8300 feet  the total length in <propmale> was round about 12 <propmale> of climbing 
the most famous symbol of the tour de <propfemale> is the yellow jersey or the maillot jaune as they say did not appear until 1919  yellow was chosen because it matched the color of lâ€™auto the magazine that first came up with the idea of the tour in 1902 in an effort to sell more magazines   the winner that year flirmin lambot 
"my how things have changed!! in the 1903 tour de <propfemale> the prize money was 5 francs  for the first 50 riders who averaged 20k h or about 12 5 mph   5 francs is what the average factory worker made at that time in <propfemale>   the rider who won the stage any given day made 3000 francs and the overall winner made 12,000 francs    that means the winner made 6times more than the average french factory worker made in a year "
in the 1920â€™s the tour de <propfemale> became very long with the longest being in 1926 a distance of 5745 km or 3590 <propmale>!!!! in the 1920â€™s the idea of the team became in vogue   until 1925 teams were not allowed to pace each other and from 1927 â€“ 1929 the race was basically a huge team trial 
in 1938 a rider named <propmale> bartali won his first tour  1939 was the last tour de <propfemale> before ww2  from 1940 - 1946 the tour de <propfemale> was cancelled  it came back in 1947 and bartali rode and won his second tour de <propfemale> in 1948  making it 10 years in between tour victories  this is the longest stretch between victories in the tour 
the year after <propmale> bartali's second tour de <propfemale> victory another two time winner from italy won his first tour   <propmale> coppi won the tour in 1949 an again in 1952  coppi died at the age of 40 in 1960  the official cause of death was malaria but some investigation have implied the cause to be cocaine overdose 
cheating in the tour de <propfemale> has always been an issue that has been discussed from the beginning   accusations of cheating were rampant from the second tour   in fact founder henri desgrange almost cancelled the tour after the 1904 race 
certainly winning the tour de <propfemale> once is quite a feat however winning it more than once is amazing   the list of two time winners i count 10 cyclist who have done this   however winning it 3 or more times is even that much more outstanding   the first person to do so was phillppe thys when he won his 3rd tour in 1920 
after the anquetil <propfemale> there were a few transition tours that ushered in the next boss of the peloton   <propfirst> merckx (pronounced merks) won the tour 5 times starting in 1969   merckx was so dominate he was nicknamed the cannibal because he â€œateâ€� the other competitors alive 
"<propfirst> merckx so dominated the tour in the late 60â€™s and early 70â€™s there was some doubt that there would ever be another boss of the peloton   but <propmale> hinault changed that very quickly   hinault won the tour de <propfemale> 5 times as well   he won in 1978, 1979, 1981,1982, and 1985   hinault probably could have won the tour 5 times in a row but was plagued with tendonitis in his knees and had to take some years off "
"the rise of us riders in the tour de <propfemale> took only about 70 years!  in 1981 us cyclist <propmale> â€œjacquesâ€� boyer became the first us citizen to ride in the tour de <propfemale>   boyer served as a domestique, a rider who works for the benefit the team leader on the team of <propmale> hinault   boyer ended up competing in 5 tours coming in a very respectable 12th place in 1983 "
"after boyerâ€™s successes it became clear that us cycling was on the rise and in 1981 the southland corporation, which is the mother corporation of the party store chain 7 11 founded a cycling team called of course team 7 11   the goal of this team was to have a competitive team made of mainly of american and canadian riders "
the rise of <propmale> lemond the first american tour de <propfemale> champion   in 1984 lemond rode his first tour and came in 3rd in 1985 he rode into second after giving up a winning margin during a mountain stage to support 5 time winner <propmale> hinault
