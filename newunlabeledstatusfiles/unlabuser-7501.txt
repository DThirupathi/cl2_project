just getting over a wicked cold - congestion stayed in my chest (as usual) so i'm hacking like you wouldn't believe  feeling better today - drugs are a miracle (when used properly)   
two of our kids (<propmale> and <propfemale> <propfirst>) are asleep here in the house and two of our kids (<propmale> and <propfirst>) are with their families this morning and soon all will be here to open presents and love each other only the way a family can (that means loud and with passion) and life just couldn't be better  and a special thanks to <propfemale> for her being her and loving all of us every day  life is good - drink it up   
waiting for winter to end and spring to arrive - i hate cold weather   
"back into the 70's again today (and through the weekend), maybe we're going to have an early spring   "
temp in the low 60's with bright sunshine - windows open and life is good   
just home from the eagles concert - good but not as good as sting and the <propmale> philharmonic orchestra concert friday night at the woodlands
