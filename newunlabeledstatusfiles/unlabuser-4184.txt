hey all you people talk to me     please?
update!!!!!!! i have an interview tomorrow at orange julias at the mal    meaning i might have a job!!!!!! yayayayayayayayayay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so    i lost my phone therefore any and all <propfirst> that were in my phone are now gone  so if you all wouldn't mind too much i would love it very much if i could have your <propfirst> again  cause i love you all just that much!  laugh 
a sad thing just happened  i went to facebooik (obviously) and i saw that there were two messages so i was about to look at them and realized that i had not logged in  so i sign out of my moms acount and had no messages  = ( and i was so happy too 
so i saw this thing where it was saying that if you were harmed by yaz you could <propfemale> them or whatever  well one of the symptoms was sudden death  so i both came to a conclusion and had a questions  my conclusion is that i will never take yaz now  now my question is firstly how could a person who is dead <propfemale> a company for killing them?
so if any of you want to give me the perfect gift for christmas i recently thought of one  instead of getting something that i don't need (lik more stuff to <propfemale> around) i would like to get my first tatoo   it would be awsome if a few people could collaborate some money for my tatoo  that is my idea  go ahead and let me know what you all think!!!
i'm baaaaack!!!!!!!!!!
you know what is really on my mind? my current bf decided not to answer my calls something is happening involving my ex which i somehow knew about    in idaho!!!!!! which means i still hold some love for him and am connected enough to know things and i only vaguely remember what i dreamt  why is life complicated?
rawr what do i do now? other than strangle a few people    
so i'm single again  why am i not upset again?
might be getting a job   finally     took me long enough 
my brain hurts     i think <propfirst> might be on to something with the too much thinking thing 
ok new status why does the facebook chat lie? it said i only had two friends on and i clicked on it then it said 4  that chat box is a liar 
i feel great today i got things done and yesterdays first job trainging went awsome 
i need to e playful laim to <propmale> about forewarning a person about what jobs they are going to do
