"my shoulders are strong, i prove them wrong\i ain't doin' nothin' but movin' on, let the truth be known"
"don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right\and i'ma tell you what's life"
"nobody knows me, i'm cold, walk down this road all alone\it's no one's fault but my own, it's the path i've chosen to go\frozen as snow, i show no emotion what'so ever, so"
"life is simple, it's just not easy"
"the first step in the acquisition of wisdom is silence, the second listening, the third memory, the fourth practice, the fifth teaching others "
"caught in the life i can't let it go\wether thats right, i will never know\hope you forgive me never meant wrong\tried to be impatient but waited too long"
what am i suppose to do to feel welcomed
"sore from yesterday     annoyed  \but <propfemale> kick back today   \cod b ops"
"and i been getting high just to balance out the lows  \and i could use a writer just to balance out my flows  \but i never share my thoughts, \this is all a nigga knows "
"and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down\i'm in the world where things are taken, never given\how long they choose to love you will never be your decision"
"sits ups   \push ups    \jamming to music -_-"

before we change the world we must change ourselves
"hope for a good day tomorrow    \feeling alil sore  annoyed "

"with my nigga whitebeezy \fina blow a blizzy -_-"
"anyone can make a difference    \right set of mind anything can be achieved"
if you could describe me in your own words     how would you   ?
"â€œnobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending â€�"
"â€œwe cannot change our past  we can not change the fact that people act in a certain way  we can not change the inevitable  the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude â€�"
â€œchange is the essence of life be willing to surrender what you are for what you could become â€�
"â€œgod, <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference â€�"
"give up the thing you love the most, for a better change in life"
people will love you for who you are from their bottom of their soul
