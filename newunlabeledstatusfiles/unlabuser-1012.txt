"what a perfect and beautiful day, it must be enjoyed   perhaps with a bike ride?"
just finished a 22 mile bike ride and is somewhat tired 
is heading back to urbana
has moved into his new dorm
what a downpour
reality came crashing to wake me from my reverie 
"it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring  -<propfirst> sagan"
decided that he wasn't walking to class in the rain 
"i think it's time we blow this scene  get everybody and the stuff together  ok, three, two, one let's jam "
i don't feel a thing and i stopped remembering the days are just like moments turned to hours
a leaky faucet
test 1 of 4 for the week done 
test 2 4 complete    friday is going to suck 
she keeps moet et chandon  in a pretty cabinet
this week is finally over  praise the fsm
"heat of destruction, flames of cleansing, ashes of renewal"
back home
"i know that in time, it will just fade away "
haircut! it's short!
once again in the dorms
a solitary soliloquy to solemn solopsism in solidarity 
within the limits of saint <propfirst> once again
"the bird of hermes is my name, eating my wings to keep me tame "
"a fatigued dream, thoughts unknown, a crooked stream, where dark seeds are sown "
"imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do  nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too  imagine all the people, livin' life in peace  you may say i'm a dreamer, but i'm not the only one "
back on campus
cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed brothers; between supposed lovers
"the poetry that comes from the squarin' off between and the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance"
"callously, cautiously calculating the collected congruences culminating in a catastrophic cataclysm to consciousness "
"there is nothing more seductive for man than the freedom of his conscience, but there is nothing more tormenting either  -the brothers karamazov"
"such simple words to calm a soul, a fleeting phrase makes me ephemerally whole "
why must inspiration only strike in the final moments of my night?
"so crucify the ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical and you will come to find that we are all one mind, capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable"
lofty realizations on the unseen ends of mankind 
"if it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break    when the levee breaks i'll have no place to stay   "
they choose the path where n surprise ne goes   they hold no quarter 
"cryin' wont help you, prayin' won't do you no good "
"sounds so sweet and soothing, music wash it all away like nothing "
mighty arms of atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
"such wonderful and vivid dreams, only to wake and find myself holding a mirage "
"when tool covers a led zeppelin song, epic is the only word applicable "
no quarter-amazing song to listen to when walking home at 1am in a beautiful snowstorm 
"a maelstrom of consciousness, thoughts arc across the sky crackling with energy and power, my mind is restless "
"when the facts change, i change my mind  what do you do, sir? a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines  consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago "
"strange dreams that feel like my brain is trying to tell me something important, but i don't understand the meanings "
"the <propfemale> tells me a secret, my confidant  as full and bright as i am, this light is not my own and a million light reflections pass over me   it's source is bright and endless, she resuscitates the hopeless; without her we are lifeless satellites dreamin' "
"i don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding, they learn by some other way â€” by rote or something  their knowledge is so fragile!-richard feynman"
"my life would suck so much if it weren't for music  it gives me an energy, a feeling that nothing else can replicate "
"pull over there's a reason why my soul's unsound, it's you, it's that shit stuck under my shoe"
this is a rain of inspiration!
"must take this feeling of power, of urgency, of inspiration, and act on it, make it reach fruition "
"you raise the blade, you make the change, you rearrange me ' till i'm sane  you lock the door and throw away the key  there's someone in my head but it's not me "
back in saint <propfirst> for a week
my muse is nocturnal
"riding my bike into 45Â°f winds while in shorts and a hoodie, refreshing!  also, good first bike of the year!"
"at the dorms, but happy to now have my bike "
say hello to everything thing you've left behind   it's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it 
"thinks most people take for granted what a truly amazing time it is we live in, to be able to have our favorite music at our fingertips at all times "
"life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life, this is necessary "
will stop chronically procrastinating   tomorrow 
"song for today, \let's go get high\"" by sublime   yup """

"the white <propfemale> tree sat in the setting sun, bathed in its dying rays the petals' edges turned to gold "
reading outside for a bit to enjoy this wonderful day 
"felt transcendent for most of the day, then i felt really awful  hooray"
"uneasy optimism on that physics test, either way fuck fourier transforms "
"and as the sun becomes overcast, and clouds began to grow, you have no fears, for you have found the ebb and flow   you look to her, and she to you, and together you can wonder, of all the wonderful things to ensue "
"is sooo good at physics, you don't even know (and is very very humble too) "
"the only way we can ever grow as people, be it spiritually or intellectually is if we challenge what we believe most deeply, and keep moving on until we find something that can withstand the rigors of life and all the challenges that we can ever throw at it   because nothing you believe is worth protecting from being proven wrong "
"anytime i feel down i just remember <propmale> hicks, it's all just a ride, and we can change it anytime we want "
"drunken discussions on free will and physics are awesome, until someone pukes "
"mindfucked by a discussion with my physics professor, and enjoyed every minute of it "
maybe pantheism
"the more i know, the more i can alter   because everything is alterable, transient   (i fucking love knowledge)"
"can feel brain changing, trying to capture this e playful erience in words "
"week of growth and change followed by study and nachos with an awesome girl and a lightning storm, happy "
"isr food, your days of making me ill are drawing to a close!"
"drawn to you without recourse like a moth to a flame, consumed by your heat without remorse or shame "
"we may not be able to alter reality, but we can alter our perceptions of it, and that is a far more powerful tool "
