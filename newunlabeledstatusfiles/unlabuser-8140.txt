"\lets leave the jews aside for just a second   \""-dr  griffin """
insomnia my old friend we meet again  i suppose i will type this paper then  someone shoot me a text 
i surrender      i     give    up    
at least i still have yesterday 
damn you instant gratification  you've ruined everything for me 
"there's a reason unique ideas arn't tried very much   no one has made a space capsule out of fudge but you wouldn't do it, because all you'd wind up with is a bunch of very delicious astronauts "
bills payed responsibly and on time for once  hmm    this feels nice  i might have to do it all the time 
i'm on a fuckin' roll tonight  fixed the speakers on my laptop so i don't have to use headphones  fixed my ipod that wasn't working for some reason  finally figured out a way to transfer all my ipod songs back onto my computer 
"i would like to take time out of my day to that my father: <propmale> <propmale> as well as my mother: anne-marie natale <propmale> for raising me correctly  i love you dad  mom, i miss you everyday "
"if ever there was time for there to be a miracle, now would be it "
time to get busy forgetting again 
too stressed to deal with people  my phone is off 
dubstep really takes the edge off    feeling much better 
was it fate or <propmale>? i can never decide 
"so, i have no idea what i'm doing  sitting around waiting for an answer to a question i've asked multiple times so i can make plans for spring break  screw it "
"most people don't believe something can happen until it already has  that's not stupidity or weakness, that's just human nature"
legitimately worried

off to cali in 6 hours god help me
in cali  hit me up 
sigh
in northern cali  anyone know of anything fun to do  hit me up 
i dont have delusions of granduer i have an actual recipe for granduer
walls sure are thin at this motel         
anybody want to talk      text me    
flagstaff bound
a perfect prayer in a desperate hour  she's everything beautiful and different 
so i'm slowin it down and i'm lookin around and i'm lovin this town and i'm doin alright  ain't worried bout nothin but the man i wanna be  and it'd sure be nice if you would roll with me 
sometimes i forget how exhausting insanity is  sooooo tired     oh well i feel so much better
