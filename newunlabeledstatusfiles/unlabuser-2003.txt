"wifes in the hospital tonite, they think she had a mini stroke, so am feeling scaried and lonely again  was hoping i wouldn't feel like this after i got married but it doesn't go away, it just changes directions a little  but wouldn't have done it any other way  sorry fore this but had to get my feelings out some how  night all "
"my wife came home today  they couldn't find a definite cause for what happened, but they are saying it was a possible <propfemale> which is a decrease in blood to an area of the brain rather than a total blockage like in a stroke  she is still showing symptoms, but that seems to be getting better  sometime i wonder why they don't try to find out why it's happinig rather than treating symptoms "
