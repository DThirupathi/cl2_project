getting ready to go to work  feel like crap again today  sad  maybe it was too much tax free shopping in hickory  maybe its just the thought of going to work 
"it amazes me that people can go on with their lives and just forget  forget the people whose lives they have ruined ,the pain they have caused, the children they have disappointed who meant so much to them  broken promises, lies, and the lack of character to do the right thing  stand up for yourself  you only get one life   do the right thing "
what does a nervous breakdown feel like? anybody know?
so glad to be reconnecting with old friends  its been too long 
"heading to the beach and to a wedding this weekend  can't wait! only 2 more days of work, then 6 off  yea! geoff will probably have to drag me back here kicking and screaming  i hate this town  sad "

i have a disgusting cough and my throat is raw  what a nice way to spend my day off  sad 
feeling much better today  it's amazing what some old antibiotics i found will do  much easier than actually going to the dr  which in mcdowell county is a a lot scarier than taking old antibiotics 
"<propfemale> (our 12 year old dog) is not doing very good    i am gonna bring her in to the vet in the morning  it doesn't look good  please say a prayer for my puppy  we love her soooo much, she is our baby   sad "
