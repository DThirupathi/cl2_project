i can honestly say today was one of the greatest days in my life (so far)!
computer is too slow to visit farms sorry everyone!
i hope it doesn't rain while i'm walking outside    even if it does i'll be prepared with a broken umbrella!
and we have one of the most randomest blackouts ever  at least my phone and ipod are good to go until tomorrow  i think this is kinda funny actually  my grandparents are talking about the old folks here not repenting haaa fun!
uwwwaaahhhhhh wish me luck! ill be nervous when i am there    confidence!
how long have i been here? oh yeah    hours thats right!
should i even leave today? its still snowing  on top of that my shoes do not have enough rubber on the bottom for friction  what to do what to do!?
"how do i lose a subway, honestly  i think thats the most stupidiest thing thats happened within this month next to some other things  imma make it up soon   "
im bouts to buy the new kanye west cd with my itunes cards  (one of the few purchases i will make through itunes) i love runaway  its mixes classical + hiphop
slippery! i swear today is goong by so sllooooooowww! almost into downtown

this is the first time im ever going to black friday! im pumped wooooh!  wink 
"so i finally came back from \shopping till im dropping\"" from black friday and i find out my dad is coming to take us to the mall  ugggghh i just dont want to go back to the mall  what a sucker   """
on my way to the mall (again) 
wheres a starbucks around here honestly? ive walked around and all i see is one creepo and more creepos 
i had one of the most weirdest dreams ever this morning and i dont know how to feel about it since its *looks around* disturbing  why me??? i wonder how this is going to effect me later because i know it will  i dont dream too much and when i can remember things go down fast 
my mind is so cloudy    sometimes i really do believe that people are way too nice to me when maybe i think i have been neglecting them not on purpose  other things come along and distract me  i'll make it up to you soon  so sorry that i didnt do my part  maybe you'll understand?
going to work    this bus has air conditioning going on when it needs to turn up the heat! my mood you ask? cold and wet  rain rain go away   
waiting with <propfirst> <propfirst>  it <propfemale> ends  dont stop till you get enough  wink 
im sick     i dont want to see ppl from church    no offense to them  just language barrier kills whatever type of relationship i could of had with them 
second <propmale>s dont come by too often so i took a <propmale>  my only issue is that i regret my decision    but i've already said it and now i cant take it back    so now i wait to see how this will turn out    wish me luck! my bro thinks i'll be fine but who knows?
im sooooo confused     i take that back    i dont know how to handle this situation  for now i'll just go with the flow   
mo work = mo money = mo money to be spent lol  my hours shifted drastically
i should have just ended it  i knew this from the beginning but its whatever  i'll end it now to save me some trouble of getting so many mixed reactions 
i am so bummed right now  too much pressure to do right when all i do is wrong  what to do what to do   
enjoy what you got because sooner or later it'll be gone   
"looooooooollll spent my xmas with a boy i like at work  one of the most greatest moments of my life so far  unforgettable  wish everyday could be like today  lifes short  enjoy it to the fullest, and im out "
loooooooooollll i cant sleep  2nd time in a row  need these kids to understand no means no 
"i think that this yr will be an interesting one  with things the way they are now    somethings bound to happen  im stressing, he's stressing    we just need a vay k lol  be far from home    with new things needed to be done    new people, new e playful eriences  i want it all    do i have the willpower to do it   ? i do  just need the money  cash rules everything around me cream "
"anyone trying to stop me at this point and time better not mess with me this time because i promised myself i want nothing but the best of the best  nothing but good intentions  clear minded, focused    im going to make this happen  i'll do whatever needs to be done to make this dream come true   its a new year anyways right? let the games begin "
its goioooiiiinnnggg dooooowwwwwnnnn    country style haaaah  random thought 
"everywhere i go with people i know i see myself in them  i understand that you lost something important to you and you think that acting like me will bring them back but let me tell you something, you cant beat the original at its own game  whats lost is lost  money, power, and influence have gotten us where we are at  so what will you do if i changed this game hmmmm?"
why is my creativity always overlooked as stupidity  people are so judgemental i swear  open your minds up and look at all the possibilities not one possibility 
are you happy now?
"if theres one thing i have learned in these last two weeks to sum it all up, people come and go  its no wonder people get reluctant to meet new people "
oooooohhhh spending this much money never ever felt this good! on top of that it was limited edition too???!!! this was one of those times i was at the right place at the right time 
"the trojan horse, can you see it? its right in front of you  the only thing is that cleverness will outsmart the masses  theres always another option  haaaaaah "
"im so grateful i met you guys  if <propfemale> never hired me i probably would have gone crazy by now  thanks for hearing me out because if you guys werent here id have no one to be e playful ressive with  happy times  <propfemale>, fried rice, and soul sista love yalls "
uh huh  i can almost taste it  what you ask? who knows  still tryna figure it out myself  give it some time and it will hit me  hit me and i will realize how simple the answer was  leggo!
