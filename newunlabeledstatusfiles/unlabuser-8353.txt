"i saw in louisiana a live-oak growing,\ all alone stood it and the moss <propmale> down from the branches,\ without any companion it stood there uttering joyous leaves of dark green,\ and its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,\ but i wondered how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there\        without its friend near, for i knew i could not    \\(aint uncle walt cool )"

"i hate to do this to everyone (including me), but i had another episode with my back yesterday  soooo as bad as i hate to, i'm going to listen to my dr  and lose the rest of the weight  i had hoped it would not come to this but it has  it should only be really bad for a few days  please be forgiving, i'll understand if i don't hear from some of you for a few days "
well the diet   exercise is underway and nobody has died yet  days off are over and i'm back to work the rest of the week  almost afraid to say it outloud  but life is pretty good  uneventful has become a good thing    at least in small doses

"4:15 and ive got 2-3 inches in my yard  going in early, wouldn't want anyone to be without beer in a blizzard  (i already got mine) takin' an overnight bag this time  got a little rumbled and grumpy last time   think i'll take some extra meds too    couldn't hurt   smile "
well i made it to work   anybody know how i'm gettin' home (or when) it's not as much fun this time   lol
i'm alone again at last   wasn't sure i was gonna make it with ''spend the night'' company 
bored out of my mind   now that it's not snowing everyone has gone home 
"i need to be on my way to work right now   can't seem to get off the couch or the 'puter  i think it's time for a fun off day, i've been a grown up too much lately ( well my level of grown up anyway ) time to revert "
have not had any sleep at all  (too much coffee before bed) past silly babble about 2 hours ago  on my way to work anyway  come by and watch   live entertainment no cover charge  i wonder if i can juggle beer 
"slept all day (3:15 pm), woke, yawned, scratched, sent hubby out for b'fast   er   late lunch  the house is quiet   my mind is quiet for a change  my phone is not ringing  it's not snowing  and i have 3 whole days to fill with whatever i want  damn, this is nice !!!!"
"spending the night alone listening to nickleback and beating my demons over the head with empty smirnoff bottles  (my mind was closing   now i'm believing    i finally know just what it means to let someone in     to see the side of me that no one does, or ever will   )  whapppp!!! got one, quick little buggers "
"well there's the sun   time to bury the bodies and throw out the bottles  (if you are confused see status update a few hours ago) everything looks different in the light of day and the pretense begins anew  thank goodness for pretense and rationalization       yes, that is sarcasm folks "
"back to work today   looks like they could just send me my check, pay for 100% of my health insurance, and give me my raises without having to deal with me in person for 36 hours every week  i think it would be easier on everyone to do it my way   i think i'll bring it up at the next meeting "
"last night (third shift) one of my customers brought me dinner! not from a drive through but something he cooked himself  (it was great, btw) i have waited on him for over a year now  i don't even know his last name  most nights i feel like just a name tag behind the counter   but this guy made my night!!!! how cool was that ?"
i have to go to work   must put down the keyboard    must    put down     the keyboard!!!!!! auuughhh  would one of you kind souls come pry this out of my hands and shove me toward my car  (  okay 30 more minutes and i'm going)

"for <propmale>, i'm not at my 'puter    gotta kill some time before i run some errands    could not respond to your message or comment, but i got both  sry bout mixup "
"going to bed   just can't take much more today  do you every wish you could some completely undo ever knowing someone? just like it never happened and the entire chain of events disappear? why are there people that would rather make others miserable than make themselves happy? no answer necessary, i never had an answer for those who asked me "
woke up feeling <propmale> over and wrung out   didn't even drink  gotta make changes   why can't people just f'n act right so i don't have to rearrange my whole world to have some sanity  i'm begining to think that there are some serious pathologies just walkin around out there passin' for normal 
if we create our own reality then i am seriously self destructive     i'm not sure some of this foolishness is within my creative ability    beer night lol 
"off to bed, i have to be back at work in 5 hours    look for me    i'll be the old hag in yesterdays clothes, no makeup and decapitated head hanging from my name tag    guess who's ?"
"catching up on missed episodes of <propmale> and californication     how did i make it without hulu com    all my guilty pleasures in one place and i can still play mafia wars while i watch  (yep, burnin iq points every second)"
"had a fight with my daughter, yelled at my grand kids, canceled plans with a good friend for the third time, should probably quit bitchin about work, at least there i'm competent  i get why people do drugs, (harder ones than i do) there are times that just don't want to be what i am any longer; but don't know how to change  oh well, back to life  "
at work
"smirnoff and nickleback don't mix well with a 3 am wake up call    but life is full of tough choices  work has let me down lots of times; a buzz and nickleback never has  always know who (or what ) your friends are, and where the bottle opener is "
on my way to work     auuughh may the masses be merciful  i soooo hate first shift 
gotta be back up in  6 hours and i'm wide awake     a victim of my own stupidity once again  bored too   guess i'll spend a few hours on youtube   there's just nothing to do in the daylight!
"aaaand were up again   third time today, i don't know if i'm really awake or typing in my sleep  good thing i've got pills for that, i wish i had pills for stupid, so i wouldn't agree to shifts like this   but i'd probably just give them away to those who need them more "
"don't know if its me or the weather   i just don't want to work  i want to play outside with my friends, watch lightning storms, laugh, hug and dance  that just doesn't pay very much  so off i go       "
"why is it that if women are complex they're crazy    but if men are complex, they're deep?  had a good night last night; a little \complex\"" but worth the trouble smile  back to work tonight  praying for a spring storm to watch and a car hood to sit on  nite all """
"second sign of spring: hubby workin' on the lawn mower, outside my window, while i'm tryin' to sleep   good morning!!!! auuugh "

branna pee'd in the potty   without being reminded !!!!!! happy dance!!!!
made it through one more boring weeknight  (i know you see this <propfemale> lol)  there is only so much socializing that i can do with sober people on their way to a straight job  they just don't appreciate my humor 
"taxes are finally done, now i need to go to wal-mart  after that i think i'll stick pins in my eye and make it an all around self torture day !!!! worth it though at least its over    no more grown up stuff till i go back to work   and not much then "
"strawberry   no banana   wait pineapple !!!!  okay    banana   shit, can't we just go back to the purse or bra thing?"
"i am without a working phone again, (and it's <propfirst>'s fault) i'm going to get a replacement today, hopefully   but until i do facebook or my daughter is the only way to get in touch with me  do not call mom's number   she'll come bangin on the door like the popo and like it  just message me here "
i have a phone again   same number  same phone  i just dried it again   maybe it will work till i get my new one    the <propfemale> up button isn't working good so i can't be held responsible for what you overhear when i think i have <propmale> up with you  sorry 
lesson for the day  beer soaked socks are worse than snow soaked socks 
got 20 <propfemale> to get to work   and i just woke up  i don't think i'm gonna make it on time  at  least the morning cig gave me time to check fb before i get in the shower  lol gotta have your priorities straight 
"10 o'clock is slow coming    i need a drink, a hug and out of this bra!!!! (sorry for the overshare)"
"<propfirst> sheen 47, is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict with no morals  while <propfirst> wilfahrt 31, <propfirst> tabada 21, <propmale> hizon 22, chauncy mays 25, <propfirst> g  stark, 22 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention  honor them by re-posting this status"
"newest addition to the midlife crisis   lettin' the girls do my hair, 43 seems a little old for purple tips and a skanky perm    but at least my hair grows fast  maybe i should have started drinking first "
"you and i wake up in a psychiatric <propmale> together  using four words, write what would you say to me  note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well  be a good sport and play along - four words are harder than you think"
"damn i have great friends!!! the one's that give up sleep to <propfemale> out with me on my schedule, at my work, the one's i can't get off the phone with 'cause they just make me laugh too hard  the one's that dance in the parking lot with me and don't care who sees  i really do love you guys, i am very blessed  (sappy moment for the week)"
"hallelujah    no more purple   went back to what may be close to my natural color   had to guess \easy night at work, bed all to myself   for the next 12 hours life is good  i will dream of bon fires, beer, loud pipes, good friends and wake up happy "

the girl you just called fat? she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs  the boy you just called stupid? he has a learning disability & studies 4hrs  a night  the girl you just called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her  the boy you just tripped? he is abused enough at home  there is a lot more to people than you think  put this as your status if you're against bullying
just can't stand it anymore it's spring !!!! first thing in the am i am going to buy paint and grout !!! anyone got a spare room that i can put my husband in for a few days!!! lol

heading to work    may be a break in the conversations    i don't text and drive  i'll catch back up when i get there 
"i am going to have an awesome night, i can just feel it  everyone is going to be nice, nobody is paying for gas with a crown <propmale> back full of pennies (and one guitar pic), the store will not look like hell when i get there, and some really hot guy will just smile at me     oh hell, i'm awake now, never mind "
"3 hours sleep and i can form sentences    cool, half the battle is over  gonna suck by 9 or 10 tonight though    but if i can make it through the haze i've got 3 days off to recover  damn, i need it too   that damaged floor is still looking at me and my unfinished walls are feeling betrayed    not to mention the etoh in the fridge "
shooshoo faced tired    emotionally drained    back pain is about a 6     wishing for something that will redeem this day 
"7 hours sleep and a muscle relaxer has made me a new woman  time to drag out the pry bar, saw, and nail gun and see if i can screw up my back again      i have no choice it's spring !!!!"
went shopping today      bought clothes that fit    from the girls side of the store!!!!! i can't say that it was fun    but i did it  i also bought a leather bag and some slutty boots   that i didn't have to buy     i did girl stuff !!!!
"got a write up at work, a co-worker is pissed at me again     and i was off today   glad i wasn't there, no tellin' what would have happened lol"

is at work and oddly relaxed and happy    in spite of everything that is wrong right now i am trying to focus on my blessings    which are many !!!!!
"thanks for all the offers of help and prayer, <propfemale> is out of recovery and impatiently waiting to go home   have not been given results but she's seems to be her usual sweet self, so i am assuming all is well   that's my apple  thank god !!!"
my blessings are still many   annoyances are few  probably much better than i deserve on both lists  seeing more each day that god really does put in our path exactly what we need  it's up to us whether to take a <propmale> or back down; so for now i pray for courage 
3rd sign of spring   4am and they are still staggering in drunk    hope none of 'em get hit with a bass boat
finally made it home!!!!    awesome light show over my house   gonna sleep soooo good  i love thunderstorms !!!

"very sadly, most of you probably won't copy and paste this  will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour??? its special education week, and this is in honor of all the children who need a little extra help, <propfemale> & understanding  these children deserve the best and are the true heart of my very soul "
"gotta leave for work in a few   i still have not got a call back about tomorrow and the weather   nobody is answering the phone  not a good sign, gettin' pissy again ! i'll let everyone know when i do  man, i hope god isn't trying to teach me <propfemale> again, don't think i can handle it!!!"

"if you are not free to be who you are, you are not free "
"the scary part of becoming who you are really meant to be is the fear that the people you love will reject the unfamiliar  people rarely see you as you are, they see you as they need you to be  in the end you choose between what you need and what they need and hope that there is something left of your heart when it's done "

"does anyone other than me ever get tired of being strong and thick skinned? do you ever just want to be free, happy and unafraid? to know that love is unconditional, friends are forever and it really is okay to be who you are? are any of these things more than fairytales?"

"a mother thinks about her children day & night, even if they're not with them  a mom loves her children in a way that they will never understand  a mom will be there for her children when no one else will  a mom will take a bullet, stand in front of a train, & ask god to take her instead of her child  if you have children that you love as much as i love mine post this as your status?"
