just came across my best friend from 4th grade on here and was overwelmed with joy    
"both of my girls are sick which means they are cranky as hell    times like this, i wish i could just get away but someone has to take care of them!!"
"yesterday, both my girls were sick  today, all three of us are sick    we all feel so miserable "
sissy (ashlynn) and i are feeling better but <propfemale> is now the really cranky one  i wish this would pass soon so everything can get back to normal 
my girls and i are pretty much over this head chest cold  thank god  the girls are still a little cranky but things are pretty much back to normal 
"a message about a cause invite i sent out    back in <propfirst> my mom was diagnosed with colorectal cancer  it is the #2 cancer killer  she has 2 weeks of treatments left before we find out if the chemo and radiation has worked  if it has been shrunk down, then in april we will do surgery  please join this cause! we need all the support we can get "
"monday night as we were heading to get chinese, i got a phone call     ashlynn was chosen to be in the 2010 book of most beautiful babies!!!! yea!!!"
"last week while heading to get some chinese, i got a call    ashlynn was picked to be in the 2010 book of most beautiful babies!!!"

"just sitting here wondering how a family member can steal from you      how??? its family!!! i am <propfemale> confused right now     maybe i need to turn into a bad person, maybe then good things might come to me    i try to do the right thing and i get shit on but the people i know that do horrible things to people have good lives "
sitting here bored out of my mind    everyone is asleep so im playing some stupid games here on fb
off to take a bath   
i love taking a nice long hot bath    makes all the stress of the day go away!!! bad part is after you get out and the kids start driving you crazy again     sigh     cant wait to see my baby tonight after a long weekend with out him   
<propfemale> just got her first pair of glasses    she looks <propfemale> cute  she picked out some blue wire frames    the color matches her eyes 
"i wish my babies would get out of this stage where they keep pinching each other    <propfemale> pinches ashlynn so ashlynn starts crying, ashlynn pinches <propfemale> and she starts crying and it keeps going back and forth     omg, just stop already!!!"
i have no idea what to make for dinner    
"why does bad shit happen when you are happy and enjoying life? another question   why is it that when you get into a great relationship, the horrible guy that you left wants to get back together?  why cant they just be happy for you and move on????"
my day started off great but quickly turned sour     my mom is back in the hospital and isnt doing so good  shes down to 92 lbs and they are trying to get her to gain some weight through different ivs  she had some drainage from her surgery and is going to have to get more surgery this week to try and fix the problem  shes in a lot of pain  so much more going on but not enough time to talk about it!!!
did you ever have one of those nights where you wished it wouldnt end?? had one of those last night and when i saw it was 5 in the morning i knew we had to go to sleep   
i miss my baby tonight    got so use to him sleeping in bed with me and holding me while i go to sleep but hes staying at his apt tonight     sigh     
the funniest thing ever just happened with ashlynn     i was laughing so hard    god i love my kids!!!!
"well, mom gets to come home from the hospital tomorrow  been there for weeks now  hopefully she wont have to go back til her surgery in 3 months "

i miss my baby like crazy     now it seems like ill have to go even longer without seeing him!!! (sigh)
the next few hours are gonna be the longest of my life!!! ill see you soon baby!
my baby got home last night!!! i feel complete again!!!
"omg, i went out last night for the first time in forever!!! i had the best time with my baby  we didnt get back home til way after the sun came up and im going on like 2 hours of sleep cause of the kids but it was well worth it!!!"
"getting ready to go get a ppo     fun    fun    fun!!! hope you all have a great day and i hope my baby gets to feeling better!!! i love you, baby!!!!"
