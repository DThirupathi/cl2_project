"since facebook has confirmed that my life is g rated, i'm off do something boring "
"i seem to be one of the few that didn't watch the mj service and doesn't regret it  it's unfortunate that such a talented person lived such a screwed up life and died by some sort of drug overdose   hmm, i think i've heard this before "
i'm waiting for our alarm to be installed   so note to all:  don't try to break in   we are alarmed (and it's about to go off for a test   waiting   waiting   waiting   i'm wincing in anticipation    aggghhrrr   it's loud   peircing>>>dogs barking>>>ears

"remembering parade adventures:  sitting on the wall at robinson's, sitting in the stands having the people from australia share kangaroo jerky with us,  sleeping out on the route by pcc, marching in the damn parade, watching it on tv (for the last 10 years or so), and today having a new adventure   staying in the office overnight with em, and hoping to find a space on the street in the morning "
"pasadena just doesn't have random blue, pink, white and yellow lines on the roads   rule for blue:  used during <propfemale> parade  if there are hundreds of other people that seem to be behind the blue line, assume you are not special, and find somewhere else to stand "
home sick   what a way to start the first day after vacation   phewwey 
really felt like a producer today when i pulled out three plastic envelope-folders from my bag each with a different script and associated other paperwork 
"really really feeling like a producer today   budgets, lunch meeting, a bazzillion calls, including once from a reporter!  2 days ago i was looking at a letter to the editor, today i'm looking at a peice in the business section! whoo hoo!!"
totally a really real producer: have a director for our first feature!
this is one of the first times in about 10 years that i'm not trying to figure out how my birthday plans will be cancelled   for years research would steal this magnificent weekend!
thanks for the b-day wishes!  i'm happy today is a holiday so that i can recover from being on a vacation!
wooo whooo!  april shoot starts in less than a week!  the only think i'm not looking forward to is having to leave the house at 6am (which was the same thing that always got to me about doing triathlons)   but i guess it's healthy to challenge yourself every now and then
zombies on the brain ;-p
"having a hangover from the april shoot   everything hurts, including my brain, but like any good time, i will be going back for more this weekend!  congrats to pic for the first two days in the can!"
omg!  <propfemale> has a listing on imdb (and i didn't put it there)!  i'm so proud!!! but in a way a little scared that my baby is now on the internet    dreading the day that she googles herself 
recovering from my final april hangover  sad 
"for all you film makers: looks like section 181 has a good <propmale> of being extended to dec 31, 2010 in h r 4213 (sec 117)   it just needs the presidents signature!  yippee!!!  p s   please see a tax advisor and do not take this as tax advice (or something like that)"
"i'll be working the hot librarian look (again) tonight, with a slightly mod vibe   maybe for the next party i'll come up with something different   but i think this is what i'm stuck with until i can ditch the glasses "
glad that the la marathon has a new route   makes it easier to get to hollywood today for the last day of the <propfemale> hills shorts fest 
my daughter is practicing her pole moves (and that was her language regarding what she is doing) to a song called pi   what am i raising???  omg could you imagine this as a character on the big bang theory?
"if you ever submit a resume for a job, please please please make sure you tailor it to the job your are applying for   the first thing we do if it's not appropriate is to toss it, not keep it just in case   because if you can't get it right the first time, why should i think you could get it right ever???"
350+ resumes pared down to 6 for each of 3 positions    i guess i did accomplish something this week!
too much on my mind   don't know where to start   lunch is probably a good idea though 
"my interpretation of what the dalai lama said on the today show:  shit happens, deal with it "

"cried at disneyland today   poor em didn't know what to make of it   she tried to convince me that i would be happy if i would just buy her a <propfemale> dress   she didn't get the dress, but i did perk up and i'm ready to be back to work "
playing chicken with oprah   am i crazy?
"yes, i am nuts "
i went to the edge and have returned victorious   it helps to be crazy sometimes 
"i'm a little pissed at pusd right now   school isn't starting until the week after labor day   don't they realize that people have to work and kids need to be in school?  and they will find some way for the kids to have shorter and shorter days, and more days off   kids need daily weekly routine, discipline, challenges, and creative endeavors   my kid will survive, but plenty of others will suffer "
"we have a cast member for driving!  i'm not sure if i can say who yet \but she is a beautiful, talented, and established actress that will \bring life to our story "
"congrats to my sister <propfemale>!  she sent me word that she totally aced her written final exam today, and probably aced the practical part too  no question about it, her calling is make up artistry!!!"

"not only does em start first grade this week, but it's also the final week of pre-production on driving by braille   i feel like i did when having em, preparing for my defense, or even doing a triathlon   i know it, i've trained, and i'm ready for it to happen "
wow   this producing shit is crazy 
"today i kept walking around saying \we're making a movie\""   i think i'm going into shock """
"been trying for 20 minutes to figure out what to write about today   there is too much for a few dozen characters to e playful ress  maybe i'll just give thanks to everyone, because it's people allowing me into their lives that makes the rewarding moments that i've e playful erienced today "
tomorrow the new craziness starts - first day on set (although it's a prep day)   we'll see how it goes   tues is the real test - it will be the first day <propfemale> <propmale>  calls 'action' on driving by braille 
d1 report: not too bad   probably d1 was too easy   should pinch ourselves to make sure that we actually did survive and aren't in surreal-alternate universe-dreamland 
d4 report:  late late call today   night shoot   sleeping much better now that we are filming (mostly because you have to cram the sleep in the the fewest hours possible) 
"first week   my ultimate producer moment:  annoucing to the pas, at 1 smile 0am, that from here on out they were not allowed to throw out the last bag of trash unless i approved "
<propfemale> will be working at disneyland!!!!!!
"d6 report:  despite the heat,  we made it through another day   i'm pretty sure that we will not have another day this hot  if we do, it will only make this movie even more memorable!"
"day 8:  at least i think it's day 8   rainbows, lighting, picking up film permits, getting ready for 30-50 extras, interviews, fittings, faxes   tomorrow is the last day at <propfirst> street production center, our home for the last two weeks   thanks to <propfirst>, <propfemale>, <propmale>, <propfirst>, and <propmale>   we'll miss them as we head on the road for 2 weesk!!!!"
"day 9:  i was off a day earlier   today is really 9   first day on the move, needed to shoot idillyic scenes at the arboretum, and there was rain and thunder and lighting   but, at least we didn't have to pay for a water truck to wet down the roads!"
"d10:  today was a doozy   thank goodness for our 5am call time; bless <propmale> and <propmale> for making us do it   we got the shots, and still made it out of the bar before monday night footfall started   this business sure keeps you on your toes "
"d12:  does anyone have the number for the department that takes care of the weather, or did budget cuts close that office too?"
d14:  well it's actually after d14  i'm doing reshoots on small days   thanks to <propfirst> and <propfirst> for allowing us to use thier house for 4 days!!!  without them our movie's wouldn't look so great!
"d17:  last day on the road  kinda trying to do some guerilla style shooting tonight  if i had known that we'd wind up with two cops on the set today  (for the permitted stuff) i wouldn't have bothered to try to make this part illegal   it defetes the point   i wound up paying anyway   \\(btw, check out <propfemale> stumpf's amazing photos from the set!)\\http annoyed  www facebook com photo php?pid=5031575&id=730579189"
