wondering if it makes me completely awful that i just let my 2 year old eat unsweetened cocoa mix with out saying anything   haha   maybe now she'll quit getting into the chocolate milk mix   
watching <propfemale> pretend to wash windows and sing it's a hard knock life   too funny

yay!! we found a place to move    finally out of my evil step-fathers grasp!!!
i just got an e-mail saying that if i give some guy pictures of my feet he'll pay me  isn't that a little strange?   
i just had to go outside to turn our gas back on and the snow came up to my knees!   i'm pretty sure that this is the deepest it's been at our house all winter    crazy   
i have to go pack all our stuff   hopefully we'll be moving this weekend if the weather is good   smile   can't wait!!
wondering what <propfemale>'s obbsession with the movie it is   i have tried to keep her from watching it but she keeps insisting   
can't believe these temps   60's for the rest of the week?   yay!   i was beginning to think it was going to be cold forever   
watched where the wild things are last night   that movie was a little strange
"watching dunstan checks in with the girls, wondering why did i like this so much when i was a child??   haha   guess for the same reason they like it now, the funny monkey(orangutan)"
"kids are watching beauty and the beast and i'm listening to some eagles  oh yeah and getting sick  sad  exactly what i wanted, right when the weather turns nice too"
i really need to go finish sewing my curtains but i'm putting it off   laugh   watching sister act with <propfemale>
could really go for some chocolate right now   laugh    watching planet 51   pretty cute
well i think i'm going to go play outside today!   smile 
had a loong easter day but the kids had fun   oh yeah isn't it ironic that <propfirst> hit a <propfemale> on the way home from church last night   he told the kids we hit the easter bunny   haha   lucky they didn't seem to believe him
"gotta love young frankenstein, especially the dance number with the \creature\""   """

the kids and i are watching <propmale> and the henderson's   man doesnt that bring back memories   oh yeah   and i saw my first hummingbird today  it's my first year putting up a feeder so maybe this is a good sign   smile 
"i find it funny that the back of the miniature marshmallow bag says: for children under 6, cut marshmallows into bite sized pieces --you mean to tell me that the miniature marshmallows are not already bite size??"
well we did pretty good on the first day of our yard sale(friday) too bad it was too cold and <propfemale> the rest of the weekend

audriana's last day of school is tomorrow   she's really excited about getting to go to kindergarden next year   actually she's disappointed she doesn't get to go immediately
yeah!   a c finally!
so i guess my girls decided to try their hands (or feet) at making wine   love it how they decided it would be great to throw these grapes all over the floor and then squish them with our feet!   oh well i needed to mop anyway   smile 
<propfemale> took my lipstick when i wasn't paying attention and painted her face with it  what did she say when i asked about it?   that she painted so she could look like the clown   meaning the clown from it   haha   crazy kid
who remembers <propmale> dad   anyone??
i think there might be something wrong with the cardinal that keeps attcking my bedroom window   
audriana just went in her bedroom while <propfemale> was taking a nap and comes running back in and saying she's scared because <propfemale> opened her eyes half way and she looks like a monster   laugh   hehe
so that cardinal is still attacking our bedroom window   for the third day in a row   i've decided to name him <propfirst> and am thinking about putting food out for him   if he's gonna be attacking our windows for 10 or 11 hours a day i think he needs some food   laugh 
i think that i love the hatter   
"watching audriana play mariokart, she's actually getting pretty good  she doesn't get stuck in the walls anymore  laugh "
"well, i think i'm gonna go play some mariokart   laugh "
"well, audriana told me she wants her hair cut  i just don't know if i can do it, her hair is getting so long and pretty  also, she doesn't just want it cut she wants it like a bob   short short   "

"so here's a good one- i asked my girls earlier who messed up their room after we just cleaned it last night  they said they didn't know but they said \maybe it was a monster that came in our room while we were sleeping and messed it all up \"" sounds plausible right?   haha"""
"seriously, why does life have to be so sucky sometimes??"
