"don't investigate scary or unusual noises, or wait around to ask 'is someone there?' run to the nearest exit and haul ass  and when i say nearest 'exit' i don't mean running up the stairs, or some other place in the house that is the farthest from the front door or open window(like hiding in a closet or locking yourself in a bathroom)   annoying morons in horror movies drive me crazy   "
i can watch any scary movie and not get scared and yet when the toast pops out of the toaster i jump
the best things in life are free until the government finds out and taxes it 
"bide within the law you must, in perfect love and perfect trust \live you must and let to live, fairly take and fairly give "
