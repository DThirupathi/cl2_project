"so part three in this three four part status, i did cry  i hope i scared the kids in the pediatrics waiting room  though the doctor did say that if anything is wrong with my wrists, which bother me the most so i'm obviously upset nothing is being done, i might have a little bit of carpel tunnel  i'd need surgery for that, which scares me too, but still "
"i think it would be kind of nice if i could actually really, really get my wrists looked at  by that i mean thoroughly fucking looked at so i can actually know if anything is in-fact wrong with me  and then i have to take a blood test tomorrow, plus all this familial bullshit  today is fucking awesome "

"it was a very, very good idea for me to decide to see a counselor again  i like her too, which is nice  now back to spending my time trying to deal with shit, ignore my anxiety, pop some xanax and play the fuck out of the sims 2 "
"also, i didn't totally just notice, but when something written or typed is meant to be heart-felt, mainly meaning to pull on one's heart strings, it's not as effective when you're completely illiterate about it  it just makes it amusing because of how horrible your grammar is  i'm a terrible person  i know that "
"guess who got into highland? fuck you, ms  <propfirst>, you discouraging whore! i tested into a 9th grade math level, which ms  hilger and i knew, but everything else i was apparently amazing at  thank you, confidence and talent in reading and writing  and thank you ms  hilger and dr  blackman for giving me a <propmale>, even if it's risky "
