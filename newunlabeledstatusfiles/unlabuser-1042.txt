"dalai lama despair is never a solution, it is the ultimate failure  in tibetan we say, â€œif the rope breaks nine times, we must splice it together a tenth timeâ€�  even if ultimately we do fail, at least we will have no feelings of regret  and when we combine this insight with a clear appreciation of our potential to benefit others, we can begin to restore our hope and confidence "
