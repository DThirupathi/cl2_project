tracing my ancestors from the old nation until now  cherokee nation rocks!
"wow! i have traced my family back to the late 1800's  i'm trying to find the ones who walked on the trails of tears  my mom gave me photos today of my great,great, grandparents  i'm so happy i can put faces to the names i 've been researching  i love it!!! i now need to go to seattle to look thru microfilm of the early 1800's and the search for my family goes on  it is time consuming though, but really worth it "
need to take a break from my search  it's becoming an obsession
