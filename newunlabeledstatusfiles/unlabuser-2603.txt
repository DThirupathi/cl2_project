"you know, dry drunks who think they're good people because they bounce from good woman who supports them to good woman who supports them are pathetic pieces of sanctimonious garbage  especially if they spent their fatherly years beating their children and letting them know how useless they think they are  the more you know, right?"
"i swear, the woman is like a middle aged chihuahua with dementia  just wish i could    i don't know, kick her or something  drunken hillbilly women suck, no matter how old or young  funny how they seem to band together in certain areas, like chardon rd in euclid  its like a wasted retard finishing school  (just another fun fact brought to you by reality) aaaand goodnight "
blah 
nicotine  is  necessary  that is all 
"black hole-haiku             \\                life revolves faster\        spinning straight into the void\                unrecognizable\\i don't know if that last line is 5 syllables or 6  but i don't care "

"i am so fucking sick of trailer trash hillbillies  or people who want nothing more for their life than to be attached to one  why are people so stupid? they want so badly an easy life that they jump at the first opportunity, that really ends up being ten times as much trouble  i swear i hope he kills her  then they'd both be where they deserve  a cemetery and jail "

egh     chinese food overload 
"why is it that when i specifically ask someone to be nice to me, because i don't feel good, that they bait me until there's absolutely no <propmale> of my feeling better  i said, please stop yelling  not meanly  and here i am, missing class again because he wouldn't wait an extra five minutes for me to get dressed  my class doesn't even start for an hour  if i had a ride, i would be on time  i hate my life right now "

"the coolest thing about tonight, honestly    i'm actually memorable  i didn't have to remind anyone about who i was  i wasn't just some faceless girl    i was me  and apparently, people liked me  which completely blows my mind  and readjusts my perceptions of high school "
i am me 
sleeeeep   but i'm not tired     
ugh  just ugh 
delightful boredom   
happy  content  thats so freaking weird 
<propfemale> sigh

i hurt everywhere    but at least i'm pretty sure i won't get kicked out of college 
"having a birthday party tomorrow    that is if anyone can actually go  if you're not doing anything and want to come, let me know "
"are we human, or are we dancer    my sign is vital, my hands are cold    and iâ€™m on my knees looking for the answer  are we human, or are we dancer?"
"c'est la vie! que sera, sera  shit happens "
is it just me or are the emoticons in the chat very      e playful ressionless?
"yea, if you were gonna come to my house tonight for my birthday     i cant get anything together, no booze or anything, and no booze no fun    so um, thanks anyway and never mind "
"i am so sick of this  every year, i try so hard to make my birthday nice, and now, as usual, im left with nothing  no party, no people, <propmale>'s being an insecure ass, and im left holding the bag, also as usual "
its my birthday!!!!
embarassment 
"ahh, sanity  sweet sanity "
thank you everybody! * joyful *
"so i was cleaning up after last night, and the weirdest thing came up missing  a picture of me and <propmale> at planet hollywood that i keep next to the bathroom sink  not the frame    just the picture  and that makes me sad "
"still weirded out about that picture      i mean, who the hell does that?"
     just contemplating the meaning of life and my place in it
i     will continue to wonder about my missing picture and potential voodoo casting stalker  and possibly lose sleep  frigging creepy 
thank god     my dad said he'll take me to school tomorrow and <propmale> to get a battery 
i want to reconcile the violence in your heart    i want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask   i want to exorcise those demons from your past     i want to satisfy those undisclosed desires in your heart      i  love  muse
"i am just a worthless liar, i am just an imbecile  i will only complicate you, trust in me and fall as well     "
oh my god! the marzipan is coming         *cringe*
so the picture thing didn't wash     now i'm really sorta freaked out  no idea who fucking took it  why do i have people at my house again?
"she dreams in colors, she dreams in red        "
ugh  will this never end?
so my dad thinks he saw my cousin walking over by rainbow babies today  its so weird to even think of myself having a cousin     i haven't even talked to him since my 17th birthday  sometimes i wish he was more familial  i always did think of him as an older brother 
"i hate people  i hate people  why does he have to break the only phone we have? the only real communication we have with anyone outside of this fucking apartment  i mean, i don't understand how someone's logic can fail to such an extensive degree that they would destroy the only way we talk to, well, anyone  i'm just so tired     "
blah 
getting a new phone     then just gotta transfer it to revol      should be the same phone number 
"    some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountain that is pourin' like an avalanche, comin' down the mountain  i don't mind the sun sometimes, the images it shows, i can taste you on my lips and smell you in my clothes    cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies      (you never know just how you look through other people's eyes)"
i need some <propfirst> jane         *sigh* stupid car not working and phone contacts gone  help 
"it is absolutely the worst feeling in the world when you've got money in your hand, and there's nobody to call  *sigh*"

"i need a ride to tri-c! like now       can anyone help me out? i have a test in like 45 minutes, and my car is shit "
"media critic dafna lemish, who has written about the influence of film\and television on children, said, \by the time\",34ec389c04d695d8adbd15a4a7bf9443,"question: do you believe that a corporation is subject to the same rules and regulations as the general public? meaning, if you were to steal a hotel bathrobe or pillow or similar, would you e playful ect the same consequences (legal and moral) as you would if you had stolen the same items from a friends home? i think not, and anyone who believes the opposite is a true and unequivocal sheep in the truest sense of the word "
