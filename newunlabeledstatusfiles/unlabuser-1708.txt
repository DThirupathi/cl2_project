why do we create a world where we can do anything? is it to get away from life? to exist where you can do what we want? to go and live away from the laws that govern our behavior?  or is it simply a peaceful period of time for us where we can think of nothing but games?
"if humanity was perfect: (1) people could fall in love and be with who they wanted to    even when in a relationship  (2) there would be a cold beer in the hand of every man alive, and all sports channels would be playing twenty-four seven  (3) we couldn't exist "
"when life shows you that you can never make the right choice, what do you do? follow what it tells you to do? or try and reconcile with what you did, maybe change the hand you were dealt or try and play it a different way    and still life says \no\"""""
"can we ever truly be happy? yes  in a 1-100 <propmale>, we may find happiness    in a 1 to 10000 <propmale> we may be in  the right moment at the right time to fall in love in 1 to 100000000 <propmale> we may actually live with our love  and yet, in a 1 to 1 <propmale>, you are guaranteed to get hurt  why?"

"what is life but the constant agony of pain, the gut whrenching feelings of joy, the peircing sting of happyness? what is life, but the feelings we feel, and the connections we make?"
"would you trade your feelings for a mute-ness that is computer-like? unable to imagine, to feel, to love, to regret, to find joy? would you trade away that which makes you into you, merely to be a shadow of a whisper of a hope of a person?"

"harrasment, even over the internet is a criminal offense and as such can mean both a school must take discaplinary action, and the police must take additional action  with the advent of websites such as facebook and myspace, cyberbullies are easier to catch, and as such are caught if the individual who is being harrased deciedes to report it "
