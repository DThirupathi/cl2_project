"ive finally given up  not just for her, but for hope that ill ever be happy again  in fact, for how much she's hurt me, i hope i am never happy again, less it just be a repeat of history  anything she's told any of you about me probably doesn't have a ring of truth to it  she is a cold, horrible person and ive come to realize this  if any of you are wondering something, feel free to ask and ill tell you "
"you know, i feel better talking to some friends i haven't seen in awhile, and i still care about her, its just i would never consider being with her again unless she changes for the better  i just hope she doesn't get hurt   "
"you know, you shouldn't just 'give up' when things seem bad for you  its a sign of weakness and the last thing you need to be is weak  don't just give up because a relationship didn't turn out like you planned  go and do what makes you happy, don't think about it anymore and be happy! there are much more important things than a relationship this early in life "
"she has the idea that she's hopeless and that no one can help her stuck in her head  for now, im giving up on trying to help when she won't let me help her  for now, im just going to move on and try to find someone else to spend my time and effort on who deserves it "

"just realized we never signed a peace treaty with north korea, which means technically the korean war never ended offically, which means congress cannot 'declare war' on north korea, because we already have, example: from wikipedia on the conclusion of the korean war: armistice, 1953 where a cease fire was signed  a peace treaty was never signed with north korea after annual attempts, never officially ending the war "
