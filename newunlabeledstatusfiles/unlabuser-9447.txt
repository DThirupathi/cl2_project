i'm going to oregon
write now i'm just surfing the web and relaxing  it's nice to have the time to do things that would normally take a couple of minutes and do them in a couple of hours; i'm savoring every minute of it!
i changed my pick because it didn't look very appropriate 
"well, there is a lot on my mind but i really don't think people want to hear allllll of my random thoughts "
"i went to fast track ( a preview orienation for my school) and it was so cool  i though i was going to be too shy to meet new friends but it seems as if it were impossible not to  there was little events here and there and they were kinda cool, especially with the leader we got, she was kinda quirky ( in a good way)  well, hope you guys are having as much fun with your school stuff !"
my sleeping pattern is like way off now  i sometimes forget what time of day it is because i'v been waking up at odd hours 
"who, if available, would be interested in seeing some khang comic books? if so, add some comments on how any of you would like to see khang as  what would you image khang doing in a comic book? what would you not want to see him doind in a comic book  any opinions are welcome  we need some brain storming "
i hate it when you draw stuff and later you think it's the most horrible thing in the world
why am i sleepy in the daytime and not at night no matter how hard i try to get tired in the day time so i can sleep?
i'm swimming in my kiddie pool with my dog  it's fun!
going to oregon tommorrow! i am so excited! the only thing is i am going to miss my dog soooooooooooo muuch!!!!
going to oregon tomorrow! i am so excited! the only thing is i am going to miss my dog soooooooooooo muuch!!!! he knows i'm leaving
came back from orgeon ! it was awesome! although it would have been better if my aunt didnt go because she can be such a pain  she's a nagger but what can you do
is anybody else getting head aches because of lack of sleep? i am so getting head aches! you'd think that would make me sleep earlier  not!
"people are too distracted with life's troubles that they stop seeing the\ good things that happen  i feel that as people we have become too \focused on life's faults jsut the way we are too focused on our own \faults  get over it people , if you aren't perfect what makes you think \that others will be, that the world will be?"
"\you are the opposite of what you pretend to be\""- me"""
i declare august 11th to be national beat khang to a bloody pulp day! who ever acknowlodges this holiday please leave a like 
"the more likes, the more khang shall suffer! sufferr!!!"
 wink 
first day of school august 26th! so cool yet nerve racking
i'm watching a fighting movie and i am kinda interested but not really  it's alright though
i only like to watch fighting movies when i am with people who are really into them
oh yeah! the best news ever! my runaway turtle came back after months of being away! yesterday was like the happiest day of my summer  i missed her so much!
i just found out there's a concordia in portland oregon  i might go there for a semester  i have family over there so i can crash at their place right <propmale>? i am so siked for all the adventures!
i can't wait to use all my school supplies and clothes! it makes me feel like a little kid every time when i go back to school shopping  i still get excited everytime!  smile 
keep close friends close  many friends might come and go but if you take care of thosewho trully like you for who you are you are never going to be without a friend  alot of people claim to have alot of friends when in fact they can be the lonliest of people  being surrounded by alot of people is not the same as having a lot of friend 
"most of the people we call our friends are only there when they need you, when they don't have anybody else to be with, when they are bored, etc  real friends are not only there when they need you but when you need them, when you are alone, when you don't have anybody to be with "
"today i find out the results for whether i got into concordia choir, women's ensemble, or worship team  i really would like to get concordia choir because besides the learning e playful erience it would lend me they go to hawaii in the spring on tour  wish me luck!"
i got in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sometimes i get so nervous that i forget how to talk  i don't get it  it happens sometimes but not all the time
"but once i get to know someone and they are willing to be my true friend i am here for them for anyhing  i hate \friends\"" who just use you and don't bother to <propfemale> out or anything """
<propmale>  i am going to force feed you estrogen pills  force feed!!!
wait  nevermind bryan just make sure to eat food treated with the pesticide atrazine 
muahahahahah!
i hate the fact that english is so inconsitent  fall the rules they say but they spell as if they intentionally don't want you to remember the words
it's funny how we underestimate ourselves in everything and how when we do things right we surprise ourselves
at school doing hw in the library  funny how college libraries are actually quite except for my loud typing 
"i got so lost today  all day everything was going peachy unitl the last class of the day  for some reason i suddenly thought it was thursday  so, i was waiting to go to my thursday class that started at 3 smile 0pm but when i got there( by the way, out of breath cause i couldn't find it) there was nobody there except theses two girls  so, i asked them to help me with m schedule "
"they pointed out that it was tuesday today and suddenly the light went off  i thanked them and went running to my chem lab that had started at 2pm! and to top it all off we had two tests that day  i finished on time  thank god, you are good to me  i thought i was going to get in so much trouble but she just laughed at me  she probabl thought \ what a spacey person \"" i agree  i am *mentally slaps herself*"""
it;s nice being so ahead on my hw  the gaps between classes help me out alot
i am so sleepy! haven't been able to sleep in days and today i had a morning class at & 7ish  i'm at school to long  i want to go to sleep so badly!
"it's funny what guys and girls say about a girl cutting her hair  a girls says \ it looks so cutee!!!\"" but a guy says \"" what the @#$%!!!!!\"""""
"i was just remembering a time i went to church with this super short hair wig  everybody got all spooked  they thought i cu my hair  they all had these \ what did you do?!\"" shoked faces  it was so much fun!"""
i hate restless nights  can't sleep  don't know why  so many thoughts going throught your mind  and the worse part is i'm not conscious of those thoughts 
"just because you believe in something doesn't shut you off to the rest of the world  you are still free to make up your own mind about things, adding or taking away from what you believed was true along the way  people who think that you are closed minded are closed minded themeselves because rthey believeyou will never change  change is inevitable, whether you change lsightly or dramtically is another question"
it really pisses me off when people are so hard headed that they aren't open themselves to seeing what you see but they want you to believe what they see  i believe in alot of things others don't believe them yet i still enjoy hearing what others believe  i think it is very interesting to see what others believe just for the sake of knowing my surroundings 
i never knew how muchi hated excel until i started using it now

had a gret time at church with my family today  i missed going with them  service made me laugh today cause the pastor gave a funny anecdote  so he's talking about fear and how when he barely came to the u s  and the first time he got on a plane  he said that he was all scared on this plane ride and he saw this guy smoking a cig 
"so , his internal monologue was \ if this person who doesn't have god isn't afraid then why should i be?!\""  my internal monologue when i heard this was like \"" that's so true *not so silent giggle*\"" then he was all like \"" if i died i am was close to heaven anyways!\"" then i laughed not so silently again  smile  """
"but then my morbid mind was like no, you would probably crash into the deep ocean and end up nowhere near the sky  man my head overthinks situations sometimes but nonetheless i thought today was a fun preach    i was just about to write peach!  smile  "
