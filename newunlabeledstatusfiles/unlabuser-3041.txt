"<propfirst>'s graduation was today; i cried like a baby   i never cry!  what a weenie!  t-bird, how abaut you?"
"<propmale>, if your'e looking, i've never poked anybody before   hope it didn't hurt!  miss manners misses mr  president "
added sh#* to my profile   now i'm interesting!  woo-hoo   
t-storms last night  dumb dog woke me up with his shaking and panting   he tried to crawl under the nightstand and knocked it over  long sleepy day ahead on the bkmb 
"was just out on the back deck playing with <propfirst>'s graduation gift  shooting at a twig in the pond   missed the stick, then shot the hell out of a tree (then i hugged it )  not as good as i was, but i've still got it   i love living out in redneck coountry!"
<propfirst> hit the twig!  twice!  the boy rocks!
"time to vent!!  ok cynic, wet blanket, nay-sayer   shut your pie hole already and stop raining on my damn parade!  do you really think you're smarter than the rest of us because you know all about what's rotten in the world? superior? not so much, you fool   we know whats rotten, but some of us don't wallow in it; we deal with it and then dwell on better things    "
"    how can you live in that darkness?  if you were depressed, i'd understand, but you're just negative  bad sh#* is out there, like a skunk in the neighborhood   if you use your head, you try to avoid it   you don't walk up to it and pet it, and only an idiot-with-nothing-better-to-do goes out to hunt it with a grenade launcher   "
"   occasional close encounters are inevitable, and your life will suck until you get the smell out of your hair   you do not invite it into your life!!!  it doesn't get to sleep on you bed, shed on your sofa, and crap on your carpet   you don't feed it the food you bought to nourish your loved ones   "
"    why do you waste your time and energy rolling in stinky stuff like a dog?  bad sh#* sucks up your emotional resources and stomps all over what you love   if you let it!!  maybe you could learn a thing or two from us silly optimists   we're happy because we're smart, not naive   nyah nyah nyah!  i feel better now "
ahhh    the weekend!
"omg! the state of indiana was the first government in the world to pass a eugenics sterilization law!!! didn't do much good, or (really scary thought) maybe it did!"

"years ago, i learned, quite by accident, to stay away from people who assumed it was ok to treat me badly, and i have often wondered if keeping myself so sheltered was wise   i think it is "
