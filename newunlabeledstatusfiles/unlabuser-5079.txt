"to me you are a priceless piece of porcelain, you arenâ€™t flawed in any way, you shine in a surreal splendor, i feel that one fateful day, i will drop you and you will shatter"
and the shattering starts 
"iridescent by linkin park, if you haven't heard it listen to it now "

"another door has been opened, and now a decision must be made "
"another day, another doughnut "
"my dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room "
i love the ignorance of many americans 
burning like a fire on the water
"lock eyes from across the room, drain my drink as the rhythms boom,"
"take all the courage you have left, wasted on fixing all the problems, that you made in your own head "
"snowboarding is definitely not for me, skiing is so much better "
"no school, no school, no school, come on, no school!"
who says you can't run in this weather?
"some people run so much that they get addicted to that fiery burn that's in your thighs and calves after an excruciating 5 mile run, i sadly am not one of those people "
"the heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground, there's no room, no space to rent in this town "
"so, <propfirst> larrabee? a drunk playboy ne'erdowell? this should be fun!"
i need twenty people to like my status so that <propfemale> primmer will change her name to kap!
"life is truly a road, it can be a highway, it can be a <propmale> trail, and it can be a muddy path, it goes up, it goes down, and as soon as you think you might reach a point where youâ€™re heart can flourish, the road drops suddenly and leaves you with another <propmale> climb up "
"i won't be the one, be the one to leave this in pieces, and you, you will be alone, alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie "
singing my butt off tomorrow so that means early friday night!

"ich bin ein echter gangster, ich habe ein fÃ¼nf in mathe!"
"oh oh i want some more, oh oh what are you waiting for, take a bite of my heart tonight"
"stranger than your sympathy, take these things, so i don't feel, i'm killing myself from the inside out, and now my head's been filled with doubt"
"i fill the <propfemale> with my beliefs, it's all i have to keep, tear it up and start again "
i wish americans celebrated karneval   
"i will be your guardian, when all is crumbling, to steady your hand"
"track, tomorrow, oh yeah    "
"promise you kid, i'll give more than i get"
is it bad my <propmale> teacher gave me a lanyard that has ddr on it???  is this a sign?
maybe doing the track workout after giving double red blood cells was a bad idea    
if my velocity starts to make you sweat then just don't let go
learning guitar chords for sympathy success!!

"and baby don't follow their lead, cuz you'll never know just how the story ends, or how the story goes"
hamstrings are the worst invention in the world all they do is hurt 
"fun, fun, fun, fuuuun!!!!"
"i just watched a huge musical in janesville called thunder into the woods, and it was lightning lacking in the second storm half the show   smile "

"caught in the waves of hesitation, lost in the sea of my own doubt endlessly, for you i'll always wait"
and the year is winding slowly down to a close
