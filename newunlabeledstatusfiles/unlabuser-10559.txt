how did i survive the last year without internet?  i'll tell you how-i learned how to go to bed at night!!!
busy day of birthday partying ahead-happy 10th to <propfirst>!!  full day of swimming and cake eating and video games!
"*sigh* end of a 4 day weekend   kids now officially have music on their mp3 players, and i don't think they have ever been so quiet!  music really can tame the savage beast   "
"my thought of the day-if you always do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got!"
so i got about 18 inches cut off my hair today-feels like my head's gonna flop forward all the time without all that weight pulling it back!
finally decided it was time to upgrade my phone   why didn't any of you people tell me how cool the built in mp3 players were???
"finally found a nice set of bunk beds for the kids with matching desk   i don't know what was more difficult-hauling all those parts to the 2nd floor, or putting the stinking thing back together!!  yet another reason i will never move again!"
"thanks for all the birthday wishes!!  was definitely a great one-won a free dinner at the white buffalo grille, then won $300 at the craps table at fitzgeralds-only regret was not taking the night off work!"
