put this in your status if you know or love somebody that is gay  my wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice-people who are gay are not looking for a cure but for acceptance and equal rights   93% of you won't copy and paste this  will you make    this your status for at least one hour? promote love and acceptance not hate
