"there is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child "
"a single <propfemale> can be my garden    a single friend, my world"
"friendship is like money, easier made than kept "
friendship without self-interest is one of the rare and beautiful things of life 
"the rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words "
friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another
