trying to figure out what to wear for halloween and how to make it work   
is pissed off at himself
now has a game to be pissed off at as well   
is still a little upset but hoping the  turns out better then anticipated   
irritated and slightly annoyed   
is sick and tired of being sick and tired   
"tired of being just a friend, tired of being alone, and tired of being underestimated by my coworkers   "
tired of sitting at work when he should be out at the club   
"has once again been left by people who said they were friends, and feels love for someone he knows is beyond his grasp   "
is sick and tired of trying to deal with paperwork that should have been done a week ago   
"at my layover,"
is driving around a bunch of drunks   
"spent thanksgiving alone in az, and dared to brave black friday by himself   "
has to get up early in the morning for a re-test and is dreading it
"tired, headache, ready to pass out but just can't seem to"
what good is a virtual pet if it runs away too?
is tired of certain individuals with which he must work with   
feels like offing a certain officer with which he must work   
"hating flight records, and not looking forward to utah   "
"tommie: one beautiful and pretty little lady; not only is she smart, but she is also a sweet and wonderful friend; <propmale> cutie; epitome of a female  ~ urbandictionary"
is trying to figure out all of the things needed to be taken care of after getting out of the army   
weighing possible outcomes   
"back to work as per usual, despite the month long field e playful erience   "
all i can really say is 410 days left   
tired of denying who i really am and just past the point of actually giving a tihs   
figured out that my knight in shining armor turned out to be a loser in aluminum foil   
"has all the bases covered in this game of life, waiting for the next inning where i know there's going to be a curve ball   "
"recognizes that no matter who is asked the only term used as an adjective is \roberts\""   """
"i want to help, i want to cry, i want to laugh, i want to fly, so many things that could be great, so many people with so much hate, why not love and why not live, we are all family in the end   "
is just slightly irritated and ready for legal advice   
"most certainly not on an emotional high, but if i wasn't in the army i would be high on something   "
"thinks there might be a loophole, and with that a ligh at the end of the tunnel    time do research, i hate that part   "
"is seemingly at the end of the rope, all that's left is to with keep hanging on or just let it go    in for some heavy thinking   "
"had a pretty good night last night considering all in all, i love you ladies   "
"lost in thought, someone please save me!"
"has now thrown it all on the table, time to play the waiting game and see how the dice fall   "

"it's being forecasted an 85% <propmale> of stupid for tomorrow here at fort polk, wish us well   "
is completely disgusted at te network of some people   
"actually got three responses besides roberts in just a week: feminine, a little pshycotic, a very happy elf   "
a packless wolf is dead to the world    alone one howls for the tears streamin down   
overwhelmingly average in every way!
"feels like the runt of the litter, but at least i'm cute!"
"been all around post today just to start back at <propfemale> zero, something smells suspicious but it's probably just the wind    yea, just the wind   "
about to take my pshyc eval  yay! now we can know the true nature of my mental state: i still say overwhelmingly average and authentically unique   
"and another example of the epic fail that is the new bravo company    all i'm saying is leadership holds ultimate responsibility, i'm just saying   "
"has rekindled the flames of anger and outrage, if not morals then just on principle!"
even as my chapter packet is being built i build a packet of my own   
epiphany - in the army if you smoke from a pipe it's probably considered pot  can't you just enjoy a good ol' tobacco pipe anymore?
just for te record i don't agree with leadership calling a soldier both a liar and a thief when said soldiers grandfather is in intensive care   
"ugh, need to have a night where i can just escape all the realities of this world    just not cool   "
if there is a greater power out there i feel like i'm being told something right now    the only question is what does the sign mean   
"\how could he do something so nice and then say something so mean?\""    \""it's because he's insane   \"""""
"oh, sorry  i was looking for cleaning supplies, and i, um, got lost   "

"i hate this life    fight for your country, put the mission first, try to do everything you can and they say we're kicking you out for patterns of misconduct    is this really what i deserve, is this really the level i have sunk down to? i honestly don't know anymore   "
is feeling inspired and says to hell with all of you! this is who i am and you can either accept me or get the hell out of my life! i am tired of living the double standard!
if you and i woke up in jail together    using only four words    what would you say to me?
has somehow found contentment in this life; if only temporary i am thankful for this much  want for nothing as it shall be provided   
done! beat me and abuse me but i don't even care anymore   
piecing together broken memories   
"to sleep the with the peace of a thousand rotting corpses, that's the sleep i need tonight   "
"not exactly the best sleep i ever had, but i woke up when i was supposed to and got to the right place in the right uniform   "
shaka laka we be friends forever!
"met the army standard so piss off, i'm doing me!"
"i am understanding and might, atop the chariot i accept the light but embrace the dark, both invincible and death, i risen to ethereal yet remember from whence i came    this is what i <propfemale> always as a wolf howls at the <propfemale>; with a pack strong but even alone always protective   "
somewhere out there is my if we ever meet again   
"occassionally things do go right, free dinner at sonic - awesome!"

"tired of emotions, make them go away along with humanity    i want no part   "
somehow feels like extra weight on the boulders of those most cared about    i'm sorry to those of you and you know who you are   
"thankful for protection of the earth, no shiners on this <propfemale> skin   "
is annoyed by people who try to drink but aren't very good at it   
why does my love happen for those i know i can't have?
almost done with my 1 5th and sitting alone    ran out of tea    what do you think?
"i drank till i stumbled, i loved till i fell, when the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell, now i know about drinking and one thing is true, being drunk's alot like loving you    sometimes o still get drunk loving you    - <propmale> chesney"

if you're not there in the worst of times why would i want you in the best? a good friend is not noted by the celebrations but the times of need  if you're offended by this remove me as a friend and move the hell along because i don't want you as a friend   
"well now i'm up, i hate the sun  it burns! it burns!"

how professional am i for smoking? how professional is an e-6 to say shit while joes are working in the damn rain? - so sick of this shit and just waiting to gtf out!
"you say gay, i say and\you say emotional, i say at least i know mine\bitch, damn right\crazy, but fun\wreck, it happens\retarded, de de dee\roberts, righto pip   \\the only thing keeping me down is me, and i'm starting to think it's about time to turn things around  it's amazing what a good cry can do   "
"was scared, but better now though i do feel kind of like a creep   "
"i'm ets'ing, but these people who are proud to be getting chaptered out without a deployment    unless it's medical because of the army they don't deserve anything but dishonorable   "
"out of four and a half pages i'm missing around 25 items, not too bad considering i have 2 black fleeces black fleece bottom and a rucksack that are mine outright"
"suckered into bn staff duty for the night; meh, at least i can get out of bde clean up tomorrow!"
"so apparently i look like a military spouse, the husband!"
"homemade oatmeal for breakfast, made by me, was not all that bad  but then it was confirmed last night that i'm a homebody by a vacuum of all things!"
"dear army,\in my time with you i have weeded, mowed, weed-eated, raked, hedged, moved dirt, etc   \just want to say at least now i'm almost guaranteed a job in landscaping \with much annoyance, <propfirst>"
"to all you military singles divorcees,\you'd be lucky to have a wife like me; breakfast, coffee, and clean dishes  plus i can work a vacuum!"
"biscuits & sausage gravy for breakfast, yummy!"
so i get to drive the <propfirst> today!
"rather a silly girl with a flower than a silly boy with a horse and a stick   \\it's called a <propmale>, helloooo!"
almost out of groceries but a good breakfast is the most important meal of the day!
"mood swings, cramps, cravings, and now morning sickness    starting to think i really am prego   "
just when i thought the nightmares had stopped   
"beautiful day after a questionable night    i may be bad, but i'm so good at it!"
there's just something great about free sushi sashimi    i love being me sometimes!
"not a bad night, a few new scratchmarks   "
"if all is right in the world why do i feel broken and shaken like a rag-doll?\\if all is good then where the he'll have i been?\\there are some of you out there whom i absolutely adore and love to death   \\everyone else this is for you,\go die in a blazing <propfemale> in the arctic that ends in the bottom of a large body of water while having a heart-attack and choking on a peanut   \\that is all   "
the whole world is a stage and i'm just squirrel trying to get a nut; i may look cute but grab my tail and i'll f@$! you up!
"so apparently it's ok to be gay so long as you don't mind being permanently single, not falling under equal opportunity, and can care for your partner without any help from the military   \\might just be me but if you're going to do something shouldn't you do it all instead of just half-@$$1n9 it?"
every girl deserves to be pretty at least once   
"the reason why   \it's because i love them, i love being with them, taking care of them, and being taken care of by them   \\the reason why is also because they scare me, i know a truly assertive could break me physically, mentally, and emotionally   \\the reason why is because what i love is truly my greatest fear   "
"the thing about the rodeo is this: last 8 seconds and you're good, but the bull doesn't stop   "
"so i've come to the conclusion that relationships are just like parasites: it's the symbiotic, where both parties benefit, ones that are worth keeping around   "
"this life has taught me one thing: fuck humanity,  fuck your <propfemale>, fuck you  i pray you feel half the pain i feel   "
i give up on humanity and only pray you feel half the pain i feel   
"is no longer pissed at the world, but instead suffering from dehydration and a massive headache   "
so in guy mode for nothing   
toast and gravy for dinner    numnumnumnumnum
"another day down, 12 more till terminal   "
girls in chain-mail looking amazingly like amazons    ah me   
"me: is it good when it comes out like orange gatorade?\medic: can be, depends on what medicine you're on \me: but i'm not on meds right now    0_o\just got to love urinalysis early in the morning   "
"so according to mental i have two new diagnosis: bipolar, and borderline personality  according to her my whole concept of self image is just because i have a disorder   "
days like this fucking remind me why the hell i don't wear the fucking combat patch for this unit  over a fucking month they've been sitting on my damn terminal leave packet  fuck these amazingly retarded mother fuckers!
feels like jeopardy and i'm just waiting on the buzzer   
overall a good night but it's times like these i wish i could   
lazy day sunday afternoon   
"there are some people in this world who deserve: to get train raped by at-least six guys, beaten to a pulp, blasted with 12 gauge rock-salt slugs straight to the skin, lynched on a muddy road filled with gravel, lashed to a pole wrapped in barbed-wire, and left in the sun to dehydrate until passing on to the hell that they belong in    just saying   "
"still don't have my paperwork to clear, but they don't understand once it's signed i'm taking my leave starting saturday   "
"finally got my leave paperwork, basically three days to clear  can we do it?"
life is so much better after my coffee with a cigarette: for my washington girls i blame you! side note - i miss coffee decent enough to drink and friends good enough to drink it with   
just hoping my gut is wrong on this one
