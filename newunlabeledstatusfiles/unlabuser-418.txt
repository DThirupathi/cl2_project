"very excited to have c moving in, tomorrow is the final day with the mass move, thanks in advance seb!"
"well, the bad news is in because i have not been able to ride since my trip to chicago   knee replacement on the left is going to happen, going through the appt issues for clearance etc   bummer but good   i need to be able to ride  smile )))))\\i have also been traveling the past weeks so am way behind on everything!  nashville and surrounding areas were more devastated than the news showed "
"thank you everyone for your b'day wishes!  the weather cooperated, so it was a nice lazy dazs in the sun, but the boat didn't get into the water because an incredible dink couldn't get out of the way for 45+ minutes argh gotta love granite pier  gatse was off so no fun on that front   i am likely going to try riding who cares about pain if it is going to be gone soon     we''ll see "

"well, tomorrow i become truly bionic  smile   please think good thoughts for me "
"hi all   i am up and walking without the crutches except when doggies are around   the knee is doing really well, but where they cut the tissue i still have a ton of swelling and lack of mobility   bummer that it is not going as smoothly as the other one   \\but it will be good \\everyone have a great holiday!"
"yippy! gatse did his first flying c<propfemale>e the second day out (to the left, right he still hasn't got the <propfemale> of the hind legs, it will come!)  taking it slow with him because he is such a sponge and tries so hard   <propfemale> is loving where he is at   going to start competing again next year at 3rd level \\stopped by the ne friesian show this weekend, it seemed like there wasn't a great turnout which is too bad "
"today my doc gave me the go-ahead to ride, the only problem is it is my left leg and i'm not sure i am strong enough to mount and god knows i could never figure out how to get on from the right lol!"
"hi all, i appreciate the b'day wishes but it is in may, and it is correctly entered in my account   so maybe there is another <propfemale> s that is celebrating????"
"i rode gatse today after returning from two weeks in <propfemale> with christian and friends   gatse was awesome, he amazes me every time i ride him \\my new (other) bionic knee is working well and only had a small impact on our trip   <propfemale> was incredible, i hope to post some pics soon "
"wow, back to work full force after vacation!  amazing how things can go from slow to fast in an incredibly short time     slowly but surely coming up to full force   the next year is going to be hell, but hopefully worth it "
"wow, check out jupiter!"
"i heard this from a friend and checked   <propfemale>, <propfemale>, <propfemale> (belated happy b'day), <propfemale>, <propfemale>, <propfirst>, <propfemale>, <propmale>, <propmale>, shep, tilde   your phone <propfirst> are on facebook   just an fyi if you want to remove them!"
"his name is zorro      (have to follow the ziggy, zag, zeus trail)   he is incredible!  a monument to <propfemale>'s breeding   super smart, bold, affectionate, gorgeously put-together!  but you have to like dark goldens and that is our thing and <propfemale>s, totally within standard "
"just can't wait!  will post more when zor (zorro tentavely sunnybrae sunset starchaser)  zorro means <propfemale> or <propfemale> <propfemale>, and i am trying to name back to it "
"it wasn't pretty, but the pats won!"
"zor is home and is so smart!  over at the rockport house so i can't download a pic, will get the cable tomorrow!  nothing like a <propfemale> retriever pup to feed the soul and remind us of the good stuff in life!"
"forgot to say, last weekend the <propfemale> clinic with <propfirst> and <propfirst> peters was unbelievable!  learned so much, and watching them hop on the clinicians horses - can you say new horse?  smile )))))"
