"it's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy   but you will always love them  re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends, they will know who they are!"
"many times i've tried to tell you; \many times i've cried alone\always i'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone\\don't want to leave you really; i've invested too much time\to give you up that easy to the doubts that complicate your mind\\we belong to the light; we belong to the thunder \we belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under"
"me <propfemale> llorando el corazon\me estoy muriendo d tristeza  \amigo mio ya lo ves\mi <propfemale> ya no <propfemale> interesa\me <propfemale> llorando el corazon,\el llanto corre por mis venas\amigo mio que dolor\espero nunca te suceda "
