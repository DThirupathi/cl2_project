"church tomorrow, can't wait "
free running through the woods with my dog <propfirst>   he can hardly keep up even without a leash haha
"this was a triumph \iâ€™m making a note here: huge success \itâ€™s hard to overstate my satisfaction \aperture science\we do what we must\because we can \for the good of all of us \except the ones who are dead \but thereâ€™s no sense crying over every mistake \you just keep on trying till you run out of cake \and the science gets done \and you make a neat gun \for the people who are still alive "
best night i've had in a long time    wouldn't trade it for anything 
dear god the only thing i ask of you is to hold her when i'm not around when i'm much too far away  we all need that person who can be true to you 
working nights suck    can't wait to go home and go to bed  
probably should be sleeping  
"i always loved the movie <propmale> gump because i always felt i could relate to <propmale>   now that i'm older it depresses me because the person i related to the most growing up was \special\""   """
"i need a moment 'cause i've spread myself to thin we all need a moment in our lives work's hard, the days too long and that's just where it begins tension has had us all this time"

"wish i didn't have to go to work, wish i could be with you instead  that's what's on my mind "
had a great night at clementines with the most amazing girl i've ever met and with my brother in law and sister 
dear god the only thing i ask of you is to hold her when i'm not around when i'm much too far away   
"i wish i could do better by you, 'cause that's what you deserve you sacrifice so much of your life in order for this to work  while i'm off chasing my own dreams sailing around the world please know that i'm yours to keep my beautiful girl "
darn you gravity   you win again   
it doesn't get much better then this   pure nirvana  
"you and i end up in a police car together: using only 4 words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this as your status, so i may comment on yours as well  be a good sport and play along    4 words are harder than you think   "
and the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay when i have so much to say and you're so far away   
"i'd do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done we both know the day will come, but i don't want to leave you"
"a thousand times i've seen you standing gravity like lunar landing you make me want to run till i find you i shut the world away from here drift to you, you're all i hear everything we know fades to black"
