"as the holidays approach, the giant asian factories are kicking into high gear to provide americans with monstrous piles of cheaply produced goods --merchandise that has been produced at the e playful ense of american labor  this year will be different  this year americans will give the gift of genuine concern for other americans  there is no longer an excuse that, at gift giving time, nothing can be found that is produced by american hands  yes there is! it's time to think outside the box, people \\who says a gift needs to fit in a shirt box, wrapped in chinese produced wrapping paper? everyone -- yes everyone gets their hair cut  how about gift certificates from your local american hair salon or barber? gym membership? it's appropriate for all ages who are thinking about some health improvement  who wouldn't appreciate getting their car detailed? small, american owned detail shops and car washes would love to sell you a gift certificate or a book of gift certificates  are you one of those extravagant givers who think nothing of plonking down the benjamines on a chinese made flat-screen? perhaps that grateful gift receiver would like his driveway sealed, or lawn mowed for the summer, or driveway plowed all winter, or games at the local golf course  there are a bazillion owner-run restaurants -- all offering gift certificates  and, if your intended isn't the fancy eatery sort, what about a half dozen breakfasts at the local breakfast joint  remember, folks this isn't about big national chains -- this is about supporting your home town americans with their financial lives on the line to keep their doors open  how many people couldn't use an oil change for their car, truck or motorcycle, done at a shop run by the american working guy? thinking about a heartfelt gift for mom? mom would love the services of a local cleaning lady for a day  your computer could use a tune-up? i know you can find some young guy who is struggling to get his repair business up and running \\ok, you were looking for something more personal  local crafts people spin their own wool and knit them into scarves  they make jewelry, and pottery and beautiful wooden boxes  plan your holiday outings at local, owner operated restaurants and leave your server a nice tip  and, how about going out to see a play or ballet at your hometown theatre  musicians need love too, so find a venue showcasing local bands \\honestly, people, do you really need to buy another ten thousand chinese lights for the house? when you buy a five dollar string of light, about fifty cents stays in the community  if you have those kinds of bucks to burn, leave the mailman, trash guy or babysitter a nice big tip  you see, christmas is no longer about draining american pockets so that <propfemale> can build another glittering city  christmas is now about caring about the us, encouraging american small businesses to keep plugging away to follow their dreams  and, when we care about other americans, we care about our communities, and the benefits come back to us in ways we couldn't imagine  this is the new american christmas tradition \\repost this  share it everywhere  this is a revolution of caring about each other, and isn't that what christmas is? maybe a note with your gift will e playful lain your right intentions!"
