"back from the gym, ready to start my day, woohoo  not "

~ music = love! ~
sometimes its to late to say your sorry and try and go back to what it used to be 
wishes i could move far away where no one knows my name and make a new me! a new life and a new start! but then again wishes don't always come true 
back from the gym  tierd as hell 
"forgiving is love's toughest work, and love's biggest risk   if you twist it into something it was never meant to be, it can make you a doormat or an insufferable manipulator   forgiving seems almost unnatural   our sense of fairness tells us people should pay for the wrong they do   but forgiving is love's power to break nature's rule   ~lewis b  smedes"
"tattooing is about personalizing the body, making it a true home and fit <propfemale> for the spirit that dwells inside it     tattooing therefore, is a way of keeping the spiritual and material needs of my body in balance   ~michelle delio"
sometimes you have to get to know someone really well to realize you're really strangers 
"life is a series of collisions with the future; it is not the sum of what we have been, but what we yearn to be "
"loves her little lovebug!! hope she feels better soon, have a feeling though she's going to have this crap like she had last year for a few months  gym in the morning "

"so i think i'm addicted to tattoos  there's\no such thing as getting one  haha"
cant wait to move back to texas!!
watching you walk out of my life does not make me bitter or cynical about love  but rather makes me realize that if i wanted so much to be with the wrong person how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along
