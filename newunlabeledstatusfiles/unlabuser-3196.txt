i just had an epiphany about socially righteous people    realizing this common problem that is still present to this day 
"i guess i am really a bassist after all   even though i have been trained on the guitar  all the bands i get in i end up being the bassist, and when people see me walking around with my instrument in its case they always guess its a bass (because i look like a bassist they say ) it must be because i have been trained with drums too  drums + guitar = bass   "
give me some fucking money
