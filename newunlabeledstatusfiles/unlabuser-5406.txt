boring everything is so boring anymore i only have fun when iâ€™m playing a video game with my friends
thy might be wondering why ya ain't not been given any gifts from good ol' <propfirst> that might be cause i've stopped playing the games on here sorry been playing my xobx360 so yea see ya later
i dont have any friends cuz no body sends me request and i dont like sending them myself
searching for scripts for my game is annoying found 3 of the same one on the same site by different people but cant find the one i want for my game
getting a time card for world of warcraft friday cant wait to get back in azeroth
starting to get bored of watching shows on hulu and playing xbox360 or building my game think i might go to the flea-market this weekend don't cant decide i need to do something though everything is getting boring
going to the flea market probly going to be boring owell need to get out for a few hours somehow
forgot to remember time card for wow guess ill try to have it next weekend hopefully
wow hulu keeps having a error and wont load my show nor nothing
call of duty black ops is the best cod there is i don't care who says otherwise only one that would be better is probably the next one that comes out but i don't know because i cant see the future
everything is slowing down and getting boring again most be close to winter
just watched toy story 3 it was really good didnt thin it would be that great but i liked it alot
been playing black ops a really great game cant wait for the new wow e playful ansion pack to come out
some one told me to get a life cuz i play video games too much and i told him this is my life i know not a good story but ive never been good at telling storys any how
cant seem to stay online keeps throwing em offline
just got on world of warcraft to find my account seems to have been hacked one of my toons i found on a realm called dragonmaw and both of my 80s had all their gear missing when i went to log on i havent a clue howit happen but this might be a pain getting my stuff back
so annoyed that some loser that sits at his computer all day hacked my wow account and fooling with all this stupid stuff to get it back and try to protect my computer is cuaseing my head to hurt i think im going to watch lie to me and go to sleep
to all friends make sure to scan your computer i found four trojan horses yeasterday and my brother foound 2 on his and another friend found one that came from farmville
if you think i care what people think about me your dead wrong i couldnt careless what people think about me i do it my way ya dont like it than stay away from me i have my own thoughts and i dont care what anyone else thinks i am sorry if one of my friends find this upsetting but i rarely care what ya think about me thats how i am sometimes and right now thats how it is
just so ya know i havent played any games on here in months so hope ya ain't waiting for me to send something back i just don't get in to theses games anymore
