"i was a heavy heart to <propfemale>, but he never let me down, when he held me in his arms, my feet never touched the ground  my eyes are on their way to being permanently chinked from smiling so much  my love is grand  and <propfemale> discovered gay town today, and introduced me to the niftiest freaking shop ever  i'm going to buy everything there my first paycheck "
time change has me stayin up late  im really craving some mango-avacado salsa  i have no clue how i can watch all the blade movies over and over and never get sick of seeing <propfirst> snipes pop silver caps in vamps asses 
mexico on my mind
"italian bread, mayo, deli mustard, mozerella cheese, <propfemale> deli sliced ham, bacon, lettuce and tomato  did heaven just pee in my mouth? oh, and stepbrothers  good night indeed "

"there isnt enough time in the day  and i miss mon amour more than anything in the world  when i got off work i bought cigarettes and reeses  perfect remedies  oh, and white wine  staying positive "
"i think it slipped, i think it smothered  i think it's screaming, i think it's uncovered  fantasy covers the eyes again and i glide with time, no past, no present, no future, it's all the same really  there is no outline to these buildings, these trees, these people  because all of these things aren't as solid as they like to seem  they're just as blended and blurred as time "
i love how the bible is in the psychology recovery section at the library  wtf  i'm going back to science and math to read about elephants on acid 
"aaah, i love waking up early in a good mood and feeling like there are so many possibilities awaiting in the day  today, i shall slay the dirty dragon named oil change, pillage the bank for my first debit credit card account, and rape this apartment with multiple toxic cleaning mechanisms "
