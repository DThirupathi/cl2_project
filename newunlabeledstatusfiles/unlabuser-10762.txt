had a great weekend of doing nothing but things i actually wanted to do  lots of time at the reading and catching up on my computer 
"well, weekend over back to work to listen to people scream at me that no one will call them back   lol thats what i do i take shit for everyone else "
so <propmale> and i had hbo on and <propmale> potter and the order of the phoenix came on so we thought we would watch it again   now i remember why i haven't seen it since it came out jk rowling is such a bitch

off to the ren fest today lots of fun
i need an extra $200 i realllly want the beatles box set

well <propmale> just left from dropping me off in lansing   3 days of being by myself in a hotel room  sad 
alright board out of my mind   i think i'll go have dinner or something

off for another day of meetings  
oh my god i just had the most amazing dinner grilled filet of north atlantic salmon with artichoke ravioli ~ roasted beet coulis  and crepe cake ~ crÃ¨me anglaise later   that artichoke ravioli and beet coulis was the best of course it was crazy e playful ensive but it's not on my tab  
another great thing i found the old episodes on the show the <propmale> i forgot how great that was 
so my day was total shit   my car got smached while i was sitting at a red light  nice   now i'm off to a feneral for my uncle that will take up my whole saturday   and the hits just keep coming 
so my phobia of driving did not get any better after the accident   i hate driving 
so again another crap day  i find out my car is a total  so now i have to find another car  i then go on to have a filling fall out of one of my teeth  so i'm out a ton of cash i dont have for a new car and a crown  if my luck dosen't turn around soon i might fall apart all together 
getting over my cold   sitting in bed watching old episodes of the big bang theory    if i didn't feel like my head was going to fall off this would be a great day 
nothings better than a cup of tea  smile
