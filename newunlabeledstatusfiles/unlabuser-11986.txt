i live in a very square state   
"another milestone of mortality has been passed  icon <propfirst> cronkite, has died "

"when you let go of fear, you can have some fun!"
"i was blogging on the freedomworks website this whole past week, where i was posting along with an overwhelming majority of other posters about truth on <propmale> care reform  now i found that my postings along with many other pro-health care reform postings were deleted and replaced by anti-health care reform postings  there were as many anti-postings in a day as there were deleted pro-postings from the past week! nice "
just saw the perfect facebook ad  the bs in religion! love it!!! nothing truer ever said!

"if there is power in <propfirst>, how come my cell phone can't charge itself?"
stupid polls! publishes everything i type there even after i told it not to!
constitutionally speaking   there is far greater evidence of argument for health care as a right of the people and not any evidence to argue the reverse   that health care is the sacrificial lamb for profit!
"last night to see me as lysander in shakespeares' a midsummer night's dream! starts at 7pm at citizens park in edgewater, co (2 blks west of 24th & <propfemale>)"

"is it just me, or does anyone else here have the same burning <propfemale> to tie the \free credit report com\"" band members to chairs and slap them repeatedly?"""
"no one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick  if you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day "
"got two rolls in a new play: \the man who never died\""  awesome story!"""
"we have to unite against sen  backus's new hc proposal that does not include a public option, but would levy heavy fines against those who do not purchase hc! backus is a corporate hc snake-oil salesman in the guise of a us senator! all you on the right, who claim, you are against government control had better also unite against democrat backus!!!"
i know more about hc legislation than <propfirst> <propmale> does!!!! he hasn't even read the <propmale> that he voted on! ask me about your hc reform questions and dump <propfirst> <propmale>!
fire <propmale> thompson!
"ok  question to fb users   if you have no mutual friends in common with another user, how and why would fb put that person on your suggest list?"
