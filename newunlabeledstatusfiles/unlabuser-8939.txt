"happy 2010 all! my goals for this year: live more, worry less, not to be so jealous of my husbands second love (sports), find myself a hobby (one that does not include laundry, dishes, or sleeping), and of course to try to have just a little more sympathy when someone calls to complain that either their neighbor is a) throwing their shoveled snow onto their yard or b) that they are mowing the grass on their property "
"today i am going to party like its 2050  in other words, i am going to drink my coffee, yell at neighbor kids to get out of my yard, forget where i put that damn remote and search the house frantically for it without avail (i will never admit that it was in my hand the whole time), and fall asleep watching the weather channel  yep  today is gonna be awesome!"
"is wicked tired   have i said before i hate the last 12hr stretch of the 36hr weekend?  no?  ok, well, i just did   wow   that came across really crabby   you know what?  today i am owning my crabbiness    and apparently talking to myself too "
is looking forward to logans game tonight   he did awesome at first last time around and <propmale> has been working on his swing   i can't wait to cheer my booty off!
"is hoping to have enough energy to get my three <propmale> in tonight after a 12hr shift   sorry babalicious, but you aren't getting me anywhere near that stairmaster tonight   strictly eliptical   i am graciously giving up my stairmaster time to you   just cu"

"says its never a good thing when you get out of work at 630am and the thermometer reads 80 already   felt like i was swimming to my car   well, good thing i'll be sleeping in nice cool a c    thank god for technology "
"curiosity killed the cat, but for a while i was a suspect "
"if there are no stupid questions, then what kind of questions do stupid people ask? do they get smart just in time to ask questions?"
is back to work tonight   2 more 12 hr nights before my weekend of fun 
"had an awesome time at summerfest last night   the roots put on a fantastic show, but the people watching was even more entertaining   there are some different people out there     and god bless each and everyone one of them; for the make me feel soooo mu"
"is finally sore from all that walking from summerfest   funny, i can run 2 or 3 <propmale> and not be sore at all, but walking the same distance makes my calves feel like someones ripping them out of my skin   ouch!"
"back to work bright and early this moring   suprisingly i am not tired   man, maybe going to sleep at 8pm is the key   i'm old   bring me my jitterbug and rascal   i got places to roll and huge buttons to push "
"is not working out tonight   sorry, babalicious   did 3 <propmale> last night and my body is protesting every move i make   plus, i'm feeling lazy today, so there you go "

"i just want to thank my mother and sister for making me bring home the fish they had won at the fair   yeah, he's dead   <propfirst> was not a happy camper   we had a little memorial service before <propfirst> flushed him   honestly, it was sort of funny   it's moments like these he will hold against me later in life  one day he will find out that flushing a fish down the toilet is not the way to fishy heaven   sigh     "

is watching <propfirst> pull the wings of a dead bug   hmmmm
"<propfirst> off to school   off to an ok start  he was completely lost after getting into the wrong class line   we got it all worked out, got him to his class, and sat him in his assigned seat next to the daughter of a friend from high school that i hadn't seen in a few years   small world "
first full day of school for <propfirst>   i get 8hrs to myself  bittersweet 
"ok, so i wasted the day away   i slept   i could have cleaned, i could have read, or written something, but i slept   i feel ashamed and guilty now  sigh "
"feels like i am in bizarro world  picked <propfirst> up from school (where he had no time outs), he offered to help me do the dishes, and cleaned his room made his bed without a 30 <propfemale> debate on why it is pointless to clean it since he will only mess it back up next time he plays  strange   "
"this weather is making me habitually tired  i am going to attempt to do something productive, but don't count on it "
"another no time out day at school  its an early christmas miracle   however, the teacher did realize today that <propfirst> is \very talkative \""  duh"""

"thinks first grade sucks   i feel so bad for <propfirst>   the poor kid is bored out of his mind   the teacher is fully aware of this, yet won't give him harder work until they get thru the \re-introduction period\""   whatever that means """
"the more i try to calm myself down, the more infuriated i get  i wonder if anyone else has this issue "
"every time i try to talk today, it comes out as a yell   i think i'm either going deaf, or i have some sort of neurological disorder "
"today is the kind of day i want to stay in bed under my warm comforter, cuddled up with my man   i loves these kinds of days "

my house is destroyed from lack of cleaning since i've been on nights   guess i will know what i will be doing today

coffee      i    need   coffee
"has had my fist cup of coffee this morning  i now realize that one cup will not ever satisfy my needs  hello, my name is <propfemale>, and i am addicted to coffee    "
"as i was falling asleep on the way home, i thought it wise to just go home, get to bed, and save the tp run for later  i think the score is now self-motivation---zero, procrastination---one hundred and    uh, forget it  i'll tally it up later "
<propfirst> is feeling better  it amazes me how much it takes to keep this kid down 
"got to see my hubby for about 30 seconds before he ran out of here to get to work  that pretty much just killed my happy attitude  he is one of the few people i actually want to see as much as possible, and i feel like i never get to see him  sigh, life ain't fair  well, time for me time make <propfirst> breakfast and hopefully get a couple hours unbroken sleep before i go back to work tonight "

has had a great day 
"is packing my lunch for the day  i don't want a banana, i want a snack pack! gimme the snack pack!!"
"i think i love coffee more than just about anything else (besides my family, of course)   it's pretty sad when you are so passionate about something so beign as coffee, and even more so when its just plain of folgers   but, good lord, i love it  oh well  time to pack my lunch and head off to work  hope everyone has a great day!"
is finally going to get to spend some girl time with <propfemale> tonight  back to the old stomping grounds for some reminiscing  i can't wait!
had a great night 
ugh   i'm sleepy  dropping <propfirst> off at school and then getting back into bed 
i'm pretty sure my dog is a schizophrenic  i think he needs doggy dopamine 
breakfast for dinner     yum!
"back to work another 36hr weekend   at least its on days this time  i'm feeling analytical today, which means that more than likely i will think myself into some sort of anxiety attack  thats always fun  have a great day, everyone!"
thinks i talked to everyone in boone county belvidere today  ready for bed 
"is drinking my morning coffee, attempting to prepare myself for the possibility that today may be like yesterday  not a horrible day, but swamped with calls with no end in sight  makes the day go by fast, but also wears me out  well, to all you people who have to work this weekend like i do, have a great day! to all the other people that get to sleep in,  sleep a couple extra hours for me "
"ugggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh     no more days like yesterday or today  please god, make tomorrow nice and quiet "

"is happy this weekend is over  i love my job and i work with the best partners, but it's been a long 36hr stretch  i'll be spending my day catching up on laundry, cleaning, baking some brownies for my hubby, and trying to get in some pilates  well, thats the plan at least  i may just go the other direction and not do anything  its \anything can happen monday\"""""
"ok, already bored with housework   yet there is still so much to be done  what to do? i guess i'll take my big girl pill, and get back to work   no rest for the wives mothers, is there? small price to pay for such great gifts "
people confuse me 
"working today and tomorrow then off for 3 days  hopefully things stay calm, but i am fully prepared to get slammed like we did this weekend "
my goal for the day: not to get upset to the point of almost having an aneurysm 
"<propfirst> had to stay home today since he was sick at school (again), so i've had a great day hanging out with my boy  plus, no high school football tonight means i get my <propfemale> to myself tonight  i love my boys  btw, i just want to say how proud i am of my husband  check out rockriver times  his photos and columns took up the front <propfemale> and almost the entire sports section!!!"
"going to the hononegah and belvidere north football games with <propmale> today  he'll be taking pics and doing interviews, i'll be listenting to my mp3 player and laughing as he is running up and down the sidelines  date night tonight! can't wait!!"
my goal for today: try not to drink 2 pots of coffee   and don't spill anything 
roadhouse 
so    very      tired 
"i hate leaves!! i should say i hate leaves when they decide its time to litter my yard  it's really not the leaves fault, anyway  i shouldn't judge  i need to blame the tree for shedding them to save its own life in the winter  damn you tree!"
ugh

"yesterday i dislocated my thumb (happens all the time), put it back in the socket and today it hurts  however, that once dislocated and bruised thumb feels better than the rest of my aching body  holy pains in my ass, batman! i am sure that bubbly lady who taught that \pilates\"" class is the devil in disguise """
is long over due for a little time off    
"up bright and early this morning  <propmale> is helping our friend coach some boys club basketball  should be interesting  i'll be there with my ear buds in, listening to some music  everything is better with a soundtrack  hope you all have a great day!"
"pretty sure i did a <propmale> disservice to my son by telling him is <propmale> teacher was a moron  i don't regret it 100% because i stand by my statement  the only thing that kept him from honor roll was <propmale>!! someone tell my why not wanting to make your scarecrow just like all the others warrants a bad grade  they should be praising individualism and creativity, not producing clones "
"back to logans school toady for award day  yay  i love my boy  i will fight for him always  i am proud he goes against the grain, is so very bright, and insanely creative  screw you district 205  my kid is 6 and reads at a 7th grade level (they tested him yesterday), but unfortunately, they just don't have the resources to help him since other kids in his class can't even read  grrrr "
"my family is awesome  my genius husband, my stubborn and witty son, the neurotic dog, and the cats that beat eachother up  wouldn't change it for anything  we are so quirky and have so many idiosyncracies, most people don't understand us  we are who we are  we don't change for anyone   and within that perfect chaos, a perfect life was made "
"promised <propfirst> i would take him bowling today  i am pretty sure my 6 year old will wipe the floor with me  i am not looking forward to the impending humilliation of being legitimately beat by a child (we will have bumpers up too), who will no doubt rub it in every <propmale> he gets  i suck at bowling "
"oh, black friday  i can only imagine what you have in store for us today  women fighting over televisions, scarves, and other items at not so low prices  i wonder how many 911 calls we will get today in regards to such  oh yes   consumerism at its finest  for all you partaking is such madness, i wish you a \shank-free\"" day """
"no black friday catastrophes    disappointing, really  i figured people would have more fight in them   well, i guess a quiet day for us is a good day for society, so yay  it's a half-hearted yay, though  hmmmm   not painting myself in the best light here  i'm not as malevolent as i sound, i just get bored easily "
"what comes around may not go around fast enough, but sooner or later, it reaches its destination  mwwa-ha-ha   "
today is waffle day! nothing like some waffles at work to make the day go by a little quicker 
"ugh   i don't want to relive the hell that was 1st grade  actually, i don't think i ever had a \good\"" year in school  oh well  today i am going for one reason only  to try to make my sons academic career a little more enjoyable than mine was  i will do my best to repress my anger at the teachers who apparently only care about doing the bare minimum in order to pass isats """
"today i am as efficient well as a blindfolded, one-legged man running a marathon  i predict it will be a bad day for me, but a hilarious one for those around me "
"according to <propfirst>, we all had better be good this holiday season  if not, we will end up with reindeer poop in our stockings  i don't know about you, but i don't want poop in my stocking, and anyone who knows <propfirst> knows that he would, in fact, put it in there to prove his point "
"i love being at home with my family, with my friends   i love not having to have my guard up  not having to worry about being judged, betrayed, or belittled  one of these days i need to open up a bit     or not  who knows  people sometimes suck "
off to mom's to make christams cookies with the hobson girls! can't wait to imbibe in some xmas spirit  yum! hopefully someone will take lots of pictures  its always a messy adventure 
"i have to say, i have had one fantastic day  making cookies with my family, eating cookies, shopping with my handsome hubby, and finally kicking back in front of the fireplace  life is great "
"my mind is always in the gutter  i can't watch sports without giggling every time i hear the phrases \ball handling\"" or \""penetration\""  right now i am watching something about a conspiracy within the naval branch of the military and i have no idea whats going on  i have to laugh like a 2nd grader everytime i hear someone referred to as \""seaman\"" """
"ah, man    it snowed  i hope to god it doesn't snow anymore overnight  for some reason, people always forget how to drive when it flurries outside  i'll be calling for wreckers from 4am - 7am  drive carefully everyone  give your common sense a workout "
"bbbbbbbbbbbllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh  yeah, thats i'll i have to say today "
"feeling pretty down today  why i let people maim my naturally optimistic and bubbly mood (hehehehe), i have yet to discover  being hated is exhausting "
"it's going to be one of those days today  you know the kind  your alarm goes off in the morning and it takes you 5 extra <propfemale> to try to remember exactly why you have to get up  you go make yourself coffee, put the grounds in the filter, push the button, and curse the f'in thing because, what the heck, why isnt there any coffee co<propfemale>g out? then realize that you forgot to put the water in  yeah, its one of those days "
"cookies made (check), bag cookies (check), label cookies and include recipe (well, i don't know if i want to claim them yet  so, no check), double up on my meds so i don't have a panic attack around people i don't know and embarrass myself to the point of never wanting to leave my house again (check, check)  yep, so far, so good  i'm coming, babs   i will take my rightful place behind the bar "
just wants to thank babs for throwing a great party! i had a great time!
"i can't wait for the fun tonight  moonlight bowling benefit for boys and girls club  i'm pretty sure both <propmale> and myself will hurt ourselves  i will more than likely throw the ball backwards, and possibly step over the foul line and slip on the <propfirst>  getting hurt sucks, but the stories that lead up to said pain is awesome "
ouchie!!
making meatballs and weinies for <propmale>'s poker birthday party   can't wait for the cards to be dealt   
"stinking cold   i hate feeling mildly ill for a long time  i'd much rather have the flu terribly bad and suffer thru it for 2 days and be done with it  my voice sounds like a 13 year old boy going thru puberty  i feel like <propfirst> <propmale> singing \when its time to change\""   lol"""
"i am actually looking forward to work this morning  changed my morning routine and woke up at 440am to get a full session of pilates in, brewed my coffee without any frustrations, jumped in the shower got ready, put my uniform on     and then proceeded to drop my strawberry cream cheese bagel directly on my pants  yep  that just happened  still looking forward to work, though "
seriously does not feel well  ugh  i just want to take more nyquil and go back to sleep 
"guess i should clean the house    but just note, i really don't want to  i'm trying to think of every possible excuse not to do so, but i can't find a legitimate reason to be lazy  my lord, i'm pathetic "
"looking forward to the festivities today  going to the comic book store with <propfirst> in a few, then we will slide out to the wick to visit with the family  i get to work on christmas, so i have to do my fa-la-la-la-laing today, as it's not good to fa-la-la-la-la on a recorded line "

"i'm tired  not just yawning, sluggish tired, but the kind of sleepy where you fall asleep while walking, and consequently head straight into a wall kind of tired  now, i'm not saying that i actually walked into a wall, because anyone who knows me realizes that i have the grace of a gazelle  well, maybe a slightly injured gazelle with 3 legs    ok, fine  yes, i walked into a wall  happy now?"
"in my county browns today and realized that i need new pants  yay for losing weight, but booooo for the impending trip to uniform den to get new ones "
"stayed awake until midnight on new years <propfemale> for the first time in years (not for lack of trying, thank you very much insomnia)  stroke of midnight arrives and the loud bangs of fireworks startles <propmale> and myself  ironically, following pops of gunshots fired into the air weren't as alarming  happy new year friends! and a special happy new year to my fellow westsiders "
"my goals for 2011: take better care of myself  start doing activities that i enjoy rather than what i feel i obligated to do  vowed to myself that the first thing i will do in 2011 was to set up my easel and begin painting  so far i have done laundry, grocery shopped, and am currently making my sauce for lasagna  easel still not up  brushes remain unused  on the bright side, i get to have lasagna tonight!"
"alarm went off early this morning  i crawled out of bed, ready, but dreading, the impending fight with <propfirst> to get him up and moving around  lord have mercy, that kid was already wide awake and ready to get back to school  i've concluded that our house must be so boring, that the six year old can't even stand it "

"i hope today is nothing like yesterday  if yesterday was a madlib, all of the adjectives would have been filled with e playful letives, and all the pronouns would have contained certain parts of the human body  i'm fairly certain that yesterday was a karmic consequence to a heinous act in a previous life  yep, i don't know who's cereal i shat in back in a previous life, but i bet it someone important   or vindictive   lol"

"<propfirst> woke up screaming his head off at about 4am  he was having a nightmare that had something to do with ants coming at him with tennis rackets and spitting food at him  poor kid  sounds like he's been watching too many <propmale> <propmale> movies  that's probably my fault  sorry, <propfirst> "
"today i will take the advise from a dear friend and be more positive so that others around me will also be positive as well  then i will proceed to make fun of all of their music preferences, movies they own, and their famliy  hooray for positive reinforcement! <propfirst>, i love ya! you piss me off and make me laugh at the same time  although, i think you scared <propmale> to death  i'm sure he thought i was going to shank ya "
"alright citizens of boone county, just a brief message to you  the girls and i have a busy day planned today  if you are going to off yourself, go on a psychotic rage about not getting hired at the local massage parlor, or fall down the stairs (again), please wait until after 1900hrs to report  thank you "

somedays it seems impossible to stop your mind from spinning  it really is hard to fall asleep when you are a neurotic basket case  i'm just assuming thats how it must be since i really have no clue what that is like 
"i think my husband is trying to fatten me up  he offered me the one thing i cannot refuse     culvers single scoop vanillia ice cream with mint and hot fudge  you are so bad for my diet, but so so good in my tummy  thanks mookie kriznasti! love ya!"
