is there a point to blowng up the world or is just good clean fun
these are the times that we need to step up or just back down   
"these are the items that are in your bag: water, pokeball, food, and a lion; what do you do?"
in this equation the only one who can win is the right answer    so we all know i'm not that so who it
can someone please tell me what i need to do    i'm lost and i don't know where i'm going tin life
we have to find our own truth but most times we leave everyone behind
in our time we all get broken and guess what i'm broken and i don't know why
qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm  now find the word hidden in the message
my heart is just pretty much hurting

"broadway is dark tonight, see the young man sitting in the old man's bar waiting for his turn to die"
you know <propfirst> i'm done  i've asked for help over and over and you continue to ignore my existence  now i just don't care
anyone want to come to sobies around 1130 with me
its been years sense the last time i've seen your face and seasons sense the last time i've heard your voice  now i stand here waiting for you to come back into my life yet i know i'll never see you again after what was said on that frightful day all those years ago 
i just destroyed the anime i just bought (i watched 525 minutes of anime in one day while i was working too) and slept for ten hours last night
"i just got in a bad bike wreck and i screwed up my right hip, my right ankle, i hit my left wrist and got road rash, and i also screwed up my left knee even more  then i had to walk across town"
i'm just kicking back with my pizza listening to the garillaz and watching the world go by
"as i sit on the rock out, that sets above the ocean water, i stare off into the beautifull sunset thinking about all the goot times that i have had with everyone of you"
"in our moments comes our truths, in our truths comes our examples, in our examples comes our families, in our families comes our love, in our love comes our our fight for who we are, and who we are determine everything about us and how we live our lives  in these moments we are able to stand up and be proud of who were are, and i am who i am and nothing will change that "
ah man my chest is in some serious pain right now    ow fuck    that crash did more then what i thought it did

"just sitting around my house being all alone because no one wants to <propfemale> out  *sigh* hello my friend invisible <propmale>, how is you?   "
"when i see you close you eye so you can feel the soft breeze flow across your face, like i mothers hand feeling her childs soft skin with the back of her fingers, i fell my heart stop for the beauty i see flowning through you "
"when the night falls upon us, thats when we'll open our eyes and start to walk these streets for we are the b s e "
drum role please    because i feel like dominating the world tonight and i need more cow bells
when we hide behind our lies and shelter ourselfs from the world's truths we are only lossing ourselfs to our darkest secrets 
badger badger badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom   
"we all fall, we all face our fears, we all can't keep our feet on the ground, we all fall in love with the one, we all feel our hearts pain, we all are here for eachothe, we all leave the worlds sorrow, we all look into ourselfs to find our selfs, and its only us who can find our truths"
if we keep holding ourselves to the regrets of our past we'll all fall into the shadows of our falling selves
i'm have way to many old memories and bad thoughts going through my head again     i have one of two choses take a pill and sleep it off for the night or just go for a walk to get it out of my head 
come set by me on the cliffs over looking the ocean and we'll watch the curtains  go up to watch the sunset over the ocean
"as i sit here in the <propfemale> light circled around an ash fire with new friends, i kick back and watch the night unfold into a new adventure"
i cant run to you no more to catch me i know i have to let you go i will not be broken for ever tear a lesson learned every good time <propfemale>
"holy shit i was driving today    now i'm going to get my learner permit, hopefully, soon  laugh "
damn it    i just wish i she knew how much i cared about her   
"i'm in i'm out, i'm up i'm down, i'm here i'm there, i'm left i'm right, i'm lost i'm found, i'm post i'm sound, i'm just who i am"
"i'm going to go make something out of myself to prove that i'm someone, not something  i also seen her again today    and i'm scared"
"in this <propmale> i wait for the one i love,  i will not take for i am like a dove   i sit here counting the days,  of when we'll lay by the bay   as i see the sun set,  i can feel the chill of winters set   i take one last summer breath,  to feel the ice cold finger of winters death  so i stand to face the sun, to walk this world in search of the one "
"as i start to walk through the doorway, i turn to see your pretty face  i feel all of the pain in my heart, because i know it can't be  i turn off the light and shut the door telling you good night"
"in most of our strength's rest our weakness, and in most of our weakness's rest our strength"
"not making a second thought, no rerets, bring the night on i'll fight it to the end"
just done    don't mind my hands they'll heal and so will my headache    i'm just going to go to bed   
ahhh!!! fuck everything!!! i am so fucking pissed off at my brother!!! shit!?!?!?
"close all windows, shut the blinds, grab a blanket and pillow, lock myself in a closest, and hide from everything"
"went to school and i was very nervous no one knew me, hello teacher tell me what's my lesson look right through me,i find it kind of funny i find it kind of sad the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had"
"123457890-=qwertyuiop[]\\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,  `~!@#$%^&*()_+qwertyiop{}asdfghjkl annoyed zxcvbnm<>?    i lost controle and now i need a sandwich    meow meow meow!!! game!?!?!? i think i lost it"""
had an amazing night with to of the coolest lady's ever  it was great seeing her smile and it made my night   smile 
"in summers last breath of life,i can see winters cruel cold knife i look to you and see your shining light,i do not run i do not fight for i feel your love in your smile,i can see your beauty for miles i feel a cool sharp pain piercing my chest,i hold my breath and fall in your arms i let out summers last breath,to whisper your my winter sunset you pull out your knife,giving me a kiss whispering your my summer knight"
why???? snow?!?!?!?!
in the eyes of a dreamer anything can happen 
"in the darkness we all hide, we sheild our eyes from our truths, we may run we may jump but we can never excape the tide, none will answer the mysterious  call, from the one that we all fear, all our loved ones will shed there teirs, his bone hands will catch us as we fall, for he is death and it is the fait of us all "
when death is looking you in the face with a smiling one can only smile back
    i'll be over here watching life pass me by    just tell i feel like myself again
"in the moments of truth or dare,there is only one who plays fair in these lives we hold dear,we always lose them to our fear we hold our head down with our sorrow,in the fear of there being no tomorrow    "
fuck i hate my head most days     i just need a smoke and probably a walk    i'm just going away now   
"meow!!!! meow!!!!! woof!!!! bark!!!! bow wow!!!! now thats the one that gets me when have you ever heard a dog go \bow wow!\"""""

"i feel your pains, i feel your sadness, and i am here for you no matter what because your my friend and i'll always be there"
"in this <propmale> i wait for the one i love, i will not take for i am like a dove  i sit here counting the days, of when we'll lay by the bay  as i see the sun set, i can feel the chill of winters set  i take one last summer breath, to feel the ice cold fingers of winters death  so i stand to face the sun,to walk this world in search of the one "
