i am having the best month of my life  i just have to say thank you to the one who made it possible you know who you are 
in a great mood sorry to the few decent people i am leaving behind but i am sure you're all happy for me!
had a great weekend with my girl   it's been a year that we've been together   smile 
being perfect is tiresome 
i will be back to <propfemale>  friday!!!
i am currently at my house in ga  i am trying to meet up with a old friend 
"in 1 month and 10 days i will be living in deerborn heights michigan!!!\\for those of you who would like to know i am starting collage in january!"
i miss av
for all the things i did that i did that i couldn't find anyone to blame it on i now blame on boredom  taking responsibility sucks
sitting at best buy with amani  just realized that i never want to try everclear again 
11 days till departure to michigan! my only hope is that it is not as cold as people tell me it is 
north <propfemale> is sucking  its cold and everything is e playful ensive 
i am awake      it is 4am and i have been up for 2 hours        i am so bored
thinking about changing <propfemale> from sister to daughter    i always wanted a asian child!
<propfemale> is officially my daughter 
starting vs classes be back on soon
college sucks      i have no life       i am also broke   sad 
tongue piercings don't really hurt at first  i definitely thought it would be more painful  annoyed 
"i am having the time of my life with my family  it is a huge difference living staying with people who actually give a damn about you  \to bad this ends today "
"change of college plans\at the end of the semester i am on now, amani and myself will say good bye too the to yesterday's trash and move in with my cousin and attend school up here"
trying to get my chemistry teacher fired     its hard work but it definitely needs to be done 
i almost got kicked out the first time today because of a bottle of off brand juice     worst birthday       i wonder how much longer i will last 
finally out of the broken home 
i am considering selling the next three months of my life for about $35k
"filled out a application that, if i get the job, will make me a millionaire in 10 years  hoping for the best "
