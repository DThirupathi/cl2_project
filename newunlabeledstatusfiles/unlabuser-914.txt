"here's the easiest way to tell awesome people apart from regular people  1) if there myspace and facebook friends combined is less then 25  2) if they are a smoker, they smoke marlboro no  27's or camel turkish <propmale>  3) if their name is <propfirst>, <propfirst>, or raphiel  4) if by standing next to them, you look less cool "

"i see her body move, i watch her body move  she's deadly poison, my only poison  (cue the epik cello part!)"

this is what happens when you get as bored as i am now: _______
and suddenly i've become a part of your past  i'm becoming the part that don't last  i'm losing you and it's effortless  without a sound we lose sight of the ground in the throw around  never thought that you wanted to bring it down  i won't let it go down until we torch it ourselves 
"who shot that arrow in your throat? who missed the crimson apple? it <propmale> heavy on the tree above your head  this chaos, this calamity, this garden once was perfect  give your immortality to me, i'll set you up against the stars  the sea is wine red, this is the death of beauty  the doves have died  the lovers have lied   "

"well, i was sitting here trying to figure out where everyone in the hell everyone was at  than it totally hit me  they are all off having lives  it's ten on a saturday night  they are either at a club, some party, or hanging out with someone  things that a normal person should be doing  however, it seems that for some reason i think that since i have no life "
that means that no one else has a life either  i thought for a second that i wasn't the only person i know living in checotah fucking oklahoma  i don't know why i go by day to day trying to convince myself that everyone else in this world e playful eriencing the same level of boredom and feelings of being alone as i am  it's pretty freakin' ridiculous  whatever i guess

"what am i doing? where am i going? i don't really know    this feeling is indescribable  i do, however, have a feeling that i'm going to do something insane and impulsive soon    my heart is guiding the way   "
"what it do, team?"
"i would let you kiss me (you're all i'm wanting ) kill me  (this feeling's haunting ) your kiss is torture, but killing me would be to easy "
"well, team i'm pretty chill "
"dammit    i just realized so many things at once  that was probably the most agonizing epiphany that i've ever had in my whole life  ashes, i love you  brit, i apologize  also, my face still hurts  <propfirst>, why'd you deck me in the jaw?"

i fear that i've lost the ability to decipher reflections from reality 
"she's touching his chest now  he takes off her dress now, let me go  i just can't look it's killing me, and taking control  jealousy, turning saints into the sea  swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibi  but it's just the price i pay  <propfemale> is calling me  open up your eager eyes, i'm mr  brightside "
"i've hoped for change, and it gets better every day  i've hoped for change, but still i feel the same  there's something wrong, 'cause everyone knows we can do this on our own  and we've got everybody seeing  whoa, woah oh!!! woah, woah oh!!! we're doing fine, and it gets better every time  we're doing fine, but i'll let you decide "

"now then i know that there isn't one person on my facebook from oklahoma  so here is a <propfemale> christmas to everyone, from oklahoma "
"has someone taken your faith? it's real; the pain you feel  the life, the love; you'd die to heal  the hope that starts  the broken hearts  you trust; you must confess  is someone getting the best, the best; the best, the best of you? is someone getting the best, the best; the best, the best of you?"
"fuck! i've never felt so damn useless in my 18 years of life    have you ever felt like you're locked in a glass room, doomed to watch everyone grow and succeed from the inside!? and the only thing that i could do is an idiotic mistake waiting to happen  <propfemale>    is a virtue that i do not practice "
"in the words of my infamous friend <propmale>, \resin hit it like a champ!!!!\"""""
so i got laughed at by a blind guy because i couldn't see after being outside with the bright snow for a little while  i'm not trying to be a douche bag    but he has no place to laugh  i got my sight back in a few seconds  i'm pretty sure that he still can't see

i stretched and my back popped  it felt pretty good 
"i just realized that 90% of the things that people like about me are products of the hate shown to me over the years  parts of me that have developed because i've seen how people are, and refuse to follow suit   no one can ever be the best, but i wanna get damn close  help me out, and show me some hate "
