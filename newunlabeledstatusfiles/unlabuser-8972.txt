"my first er visit? this isn't interesting, this is bullshit  d:"
i'm trying to convince <propfirst> that its a great idea to get me hopped up on the vicodin the doc gave me and go see sucker punch to see how whacked out i get  probably not going to happen though   playful 
"more ponies tomorrow!  love  ponies make everything better, especially since i now have the boys hooked on it "

"also listening to teenage pre-midtwenties girls talk about guys is absolutely maddening  sorry sweety, just because a guy tells you you're pretty but would rather <propfemale> out with his friends does not mean he's gay  it means you're pretty, but you are dull as fuck  accept it, move on, stop making me listen to your whinefest while i'm on my break   what a waste   rant "
"insidious = darth maul is a pedo \\save your 8 50  you'll thank me later "

hey guys! thanks for the prayers and good vibes  my family and i packed up our belongings and animals around 1am last night and saw the fire climb over the ridge leading to our home just as we drove off  we're in a hotel in loveland right now  the one neighbor that stayed to take care of their buffalo called a moment ago to let us know that they think the fire just missed our place
