"''i didn't feel confused or silly or any of the other emotions people usually ascibe to those who are in love  no, i wasn't ''falling'' in love  rising was more the word  every part of me felt more alive, more complete  it was as if i had suddenly become fine-tuned to a deeper awareness of life itself '' - my favorite book"
