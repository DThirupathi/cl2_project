happy new year!
blah blah blah 
has become way too cynical and pessimistic 
has tie-dye ink on her hands and feet!
is making an effort to see the best in people and situations 
is trying to discover what feeds her soul 
just is 
: procrastinating is not a good way to start off the day or week 
the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances  -- viktor e  frankl (paraphrased)
: happy 4th!
is reading about institutional and student assessment (but would rather not be) 
is exhausted with a long day ahead and a big pile of work

who knew that disambiguation is another word for writer's block? i think i'll start using that   it sounds more disturbing 
: sometimes a good cry makes everything better 
is doing homework and packing : )
resigned to the fact that i will have to take homework and work to new orleans with me  it's all good though! at least my office is clean!
will be leaving @ 5 smile 0 tuesday morning!
ready to leave for a 26 hour bus ride   will be tweeting from bus and trip!
awake but sick and still tired even after sleeping all day yesterday  felt good to sleep in my own bed after 10 days of sleeping in hotel bus tent 
"still behind on homework   it's not like me   i usually procrastinate, but i always get my work done "
finished homework and am now watching true blood 
"finally, true blood is starting to match up with the books (with a few exceptions) "

is finally catching up from vacation 
"wants to paint, blog and run around barefoot in a meadow "
"<propfirst> vick? really? why take the pr hit for a player who isn't even going to play? i hope philly gives the animal torturing idiot the \welcome\"" he deserves """

"was it just me or was the acting on true blood this week really, really good? i loved the subtle nuisances "
"is writing, writing, writing!"
"went off grid for a while, but i'm trying to be back!"
fighting against the overwhelming urge to crawl back into bed and pull the covers over my head 
"got a new hair color and cut tonight  i walked in the door, and <propfirst> said \hi <propfemale>\"" (a la <propfemale> danes circa 1994)  great    """

"is soooo happy to have the heat working again after coming home to a very cold house  4 hours and a <propmale> of $$$ later, we have heat just in time for bed "
possible snow   really??? ugh 
thinking about trying to score <propfemale> in chains tix at 10 a m  saturday--wondering if it's better than nothing or if i will regret not seeing them years ago even more than i already do (sigh)
