my house is officially on sale now! woot
i am a pack so to solve some of my issues i am selling a shoe box full of <propfemale> gi oh cards  75 80 dollars it may seem much but with what all is in there it is worth it 
"i have dreamt of a place for you and i no one knows who we are there all i want is to give my life only to you i've dreamt so long i cannot dream anymore let's run away, i'll take you there"
"graduation is 2 months away! yes!   oh man  country roads, take me home to the place, i be-long west <propfemale>, mountain momma take me home, country roads"
"today is the best day ever and i feel like nothing can damper it  my teacher gave me help on a paper to redeem my grade, i am going on a long waited trip saturday and i asked the guy i like out and he said yes! i have my very first boyfriend and couldn't feel any more happier than i feel now "
for those of you who have my number and are able to text me   don't do it! i am running out of minutes!!!!
ok so i am still out of minutes on my phone  god i wish i had a real phone with unlimited texting to talk to him  i have to use a friends phone just to text him  i feel bad on the bright side i get to go shopping  hmmm i wonder what i will get him? just kidding i already know  then i get to see him tomorrow  yes
ok till fruther notice do not text me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am so tired going to bed tt4n
i was chasing my dreams with a coke and a smile only you make me happy if that was the real thing then iâ€™m in denial only you make me happy now my heartâ€™s on my sleeve donâ€™t care if iâ€™m not in style only you make me happy superficial fake and fleeting fashion statements have no meaning only you make me happy only you make me happy everything will change but you remain the same only you make me happy
"my boyfriend's back, and you're gonna be in trouble (hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)  when you see him comin', better cut on the double (hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)  you've been spreadin' lies that i was untrue (hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)  so look out now, 'cause he's comin' after you (hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)"
"dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me and dear my love, haven't you longed to be free i can't keep pretending that i don't even know you and at sweet night, you are my own take my hand we're leaving here tonight there's no need to tell anyone they'd only hold us down so by the morning light we'll be half way to anywhere where love is more than just your name"
just because i have joined a lot of groups supporting gay rights and all that comes with that does not make me gay  i support it because we have no right on how to tell others who they should love and how they should love  get over yourselves ppl 
if you approve gay-marriages put this in your profile and add your name  to the list: <propfemale>
i wish for this night-time to last for a  life-time the darkness around me - shores of a solar sea oh how i wish to go down with the sun sleeping weeping with you
"i'm not a stranger, no, i am yours with crippled anger and tears that  still drip sore a fragile frame aged with misery and when our  eyes meet i know you'll see i do not wanna be afraid i do not  wanna die inside just to breathe in i'm tired of feeling so numb relief  exists, i find it when i am cut"
that i love you i have loved you all along and i miss you been far away for far too long i keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go stop breathing if i don't see you anymore
"nights in white satin, never reaching the end, letters i've written, never meaning to send  beauty id always missed with these eyes before, just what the truth is i can't say anymore  cause i love you, yes, i love you, oh, how, i love you "
i wish i had your pair of wings just like last night in my dreams i was lost in paradise wish i'd never opened my eyes sometimes i wish i were an angel sometimes i wish i were you sometimes i wish i were an angel sometimes i wish i were you
