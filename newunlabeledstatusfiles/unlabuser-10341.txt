"scene of complacency, an apathetic mind \but when it's brought to light, i see a <propmale> on a borrowed throne \right now, the violence ta<propmale> over \this time, regimes are changing in my mind \\i'm so sorry, my old friend, i'm leaving you tonight \so caught in this moment, the last breath of your life\\regime change by disciple\\i love this band, its an awesome song!"
its 330 am       and who's still awake?  this guy!!  guess ill do some laundry and watch a movie!
what's the point?
"looking for an easy way out, someone to blame\\why does it work this way, still today?\\you wanna take somebody down along the way?\\but i won't let that one be me, 'cause i don't want the drama it brings\\see, today isn't \back in the day\"" anymore\",d2b12f71b4fe2465815f9d32b59cea21,"despite the lies that you're making\your love is mine for the taking\my love is just waiting\to turn your tears to roses\\i will be the one that's gonna hold you\i will be the one that you run to\my love is a burning, consuming fire\\no, you'll never be alone\when darkness comes\\i'll light the night with stars\hear my whispers in the dark"
"what would it take to make you see me\the way that i see you?\and what would it take to make you want me\the way i've always wanted you?\\i don't know why you're in everything i see\and i can't deny that you're everything i need\so i reach in\\whatever it takes to get to you\whatever it takes to break through\whatever it takes you are my reason\for everything i do"
<propmale> is a dominator and i bow to him
"is wishing he didn't have to work tonite so he could watch the jayhawks destroy colorado state!  oh well, thats why they invented dvr!!"
"be the change that u want to see in the world \\ghandi"
"i'm at war with the world\and they try to pull me into the dark\i struggle to find my faith\as i'm slipping from your arms\\it's getting harder to stay awake\and my strength is fading fast\you breathe into me at last\\i'm awake, i'm alive\now i know what i believe inside\now it's my time\i'll do what i want 'cause this is my life"
"when we look around and we don't know what to say\how did we lose our way? i don't know if we'll ever really see a change\if this is how we show our thanks, i think it's time we rearrange\i don't know if we'll ever really break away\we've been holding on for so long now, i think we're scared to run away\i don't know if we ever really learned to pray\so, i drop down to my knees\and i cry out, can you help me, please"
"the secret side of me, i never let you see\i keep it caged but i can't control it\so stay away from me, the beast is ugly\i feel the rage and i just can't hold it\\it's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls\it comes awake and i can't control it\hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head\why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end?"
"so, you think you can see inside my mind? \you probably could if you just took a little time \i know exactly what you're trying to say\but sitting in the stands ain't the same as playing the game\so, i can't comprehend in my mind\just why we can't leave it all behind \so, come on and stand beside, and hold the line \'cause tonight is the night we cry \\oh\you can't bring me down"
"we drive on and don't look back\it doesn't mean we can't learn from our past\all the things that we might've done wrong\we could've been doing this all along\\everybody with your fists raised high\let me hear your battle cry tonight\stand beside or step aside\we're on the front line"

"take me past the outer courts\into the holy place\past the brazen altar\lord i want to see your face\pass me by the crowds of people\and the priests who sing your praise\i hunger and thirst for your righteousness\but it's only found in one place\\take me into the holy of holies\take me in by the blood of the lamb\take me into the holy of holies\take the coal, touch my lips, here i am\kutless \take me in\"""""
"your touch, your ways\leave me dumb without reason\your love, my cage\my prison so pleasing\i spend my days\tangled in thoughts of you\stuck in this place\resigned to be your fool\\i thirst no longer\drenching my soul\pour out like water\\you're my only infatuation\don't leave me stranded\in my obsession\my purpose, my possession\live and die in my obsession\my obsession"
"say what you want to say about me\throw up what you want to throw up at me\but when you mess with those that are around me\that's when you and i will have a problem"
"death until the dust, and we're waiting\ruined in the rust, of our craving\it feels like, it feels like\don't you know the cost, of your betrayal?\you're the one that's lost, you're gonna fail\it feels like, like you're gasping with all your might\\you can't take away my strength\fix these broken veins\you can't take away my pride, i won't be denied\there's nothing left to fight (live free or let me die)"
"say what you want to say about me\throw up what you want to throw up at me\but when you mess with those that are around me\that's when you and i will have a problem"
"'m just a step away\i'm just a breath away\losing my faith today\falling off the edge today\\i am just a man\not superhuman\i'm not superhuman\someone save me from the hate\\it's just another war\just another family torn\falling from my faith today\just a step from the edge\just another day in the world we live\\i need a hero to save me now"
wish i was as cool as <propfemale>!!!
i bow down to <propfemale> and malarie!!!
i bow down to <propfemale>'s awesomeness!!! and im jealous of her!!!
"say what you want to say about me\throw up what you want to throw up at me\but when you mess with those that are around me\that's when you and i will have a problem"
"and this is how it feels when i ignore the words you spoke to me\and this is where i lose myself when i keep running away from you\and this is who i am when, when i don't know myself anymore\and this is what i choose when it's all left up to me\\breathe your life into me, i can feel you\i'm falling, falling faster\breathe your life into me, i still need you\i'm falling, falling\\breathe into me\breathe into me"
"your touch, your ways\leave me dumb without reason\your love, my cage\my prison so pleasing\i spend my days\tangled in thoughts of you\stuck in this place\resigned to be your fool\\i thirst no longer\drenching my soul\pour out like water\\you're my only infatuation\don't leave me stranded\in my obsession\my purpose, my possession\live and die in my obsession\my obsession"
don't know what to do  im bored 
"a long day alone, emptiness is so real\never having peace of mind\running from what i can't sing\and there is nowhere left to hide\turn and face these empty lies\all alone, heart unturned, trying to find\\break me down, replace this fear inside\take this nothingness from me\i want to fight, i want to shine\i want to rise, break me down"
highlight of the night:  going in the ditch on my way home from work!  awesome!!
"i lie here paralytic, inside this soul\screaming for you till my throat is numb\i wanna break out i need a way out\i don't believe that it's gotta be this way\the worst is the waiting\in this womb i'm suffocating\\tell me when i'm gonna live again\tell me when i'm gonna breathe you in\tell me when i'm gonna feel inside\tell me when i'm gonna feel alive"
"you can't take away my pride, i wont be denied!\live free or let me die!"
"i don't wanna feel like this tomorrow\i don't wanna live like this today\make me feel better, i wanna feel better\stay with me here now and never surrender\never surrender\\put me back together\never surrender, make me feel better\you make me feel better\stay with me here now and never surrender"

"the last night you'll spend alone\i'll wrap you in my arms and i won't let go\i'm everything you need me to be"
"as time went on, i opened up my eyes\you never really knew me\you donâ€™t know whatâ€™s deep inside\\just so you know, iâ€™ll never be like you\iâ€™ll take what god has made me\iâ€™m not an empty shell\and i hope that you see\instead of following\\iâ€™m finally awake\i feel alive today\i feel everything\itâ€™s all so clear to me"
"i'm so sick of when they say\it's just a phase, you'll be okay, you're fine\but i know it's a lie\\this is the last night you'll spend alone\look me in the eyes so i know you know\i'm everywhere you want me to be\\the last night you'll spend alone\i'll wrap you in my arms and i won't let go\i'm everything you need me to be\the last night away from me"
"worthy is the lamb who was slain\holy, holy is he\sing a new song to him who sits on\heaven's mercy seat\\holy, holy, holy is the lord god almighty\who was and is and is to come\with all creation i sing praise to the <propmale> of kings\you are my everything and i will adore you\\filled with wonder awestruck wonder\at the mention of your name\jesus your name is power, breath and living water\such a marvelous mystery"
