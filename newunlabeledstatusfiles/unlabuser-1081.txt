"i am not a packers fan, not even a little   but no one will beat <propfirst> rodgers if he stays on fire like this"
amazed at how greedy people and companies can become  i am starting to feel like a mule    with no carrot

nothing better than working in a car with weeks old food stuck in the floorboards
