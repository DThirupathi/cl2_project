what can i say
"tell me exactly what am i supposed to do? now that i have allowed you to beat me! do you think that we could play another game? maybe i can win this time? i kind of like the misery you put me through  darling, you can trust me completely "
"you don't have to bow your head in shame  'cause i can see right through you and i know that you have felt that way  never will i bow my head in shame  i live this life with no regret, a lesson for you in respect "
have you ever woke up and just said what a waste of my fucking life why do i even care if they dont    well i just did that and guess what im over it    to each his or her own    peace and pizza grease 
"you dont know me, so dont judge me  you dont know you, your too scared to  you think you know, why im here after all these years  you wanna know? well ill tell you fucking why, go  for myself  for my friends  for my family  forever ill take this to the bitter end"

ill never bow my head in shame i live this life for no one else so save your judgement for yourself 
there will be blood on my fists  on your face on the ground around us this is pain have a taste i'm addicted to the rush
keep holdin on when my brain's tickin' like a bomb guess the black thoughts have  come again to get me sweet bitter words unlike nothing i have heard sing along mocking bird you don't affect me that's right deliverance of my heart please strike be deliberate wait i'm coming undone irate i'm coming undone too late i'm coming undone what looks so strong so delicate
"life's gotta always be messing with me can't they chill and let me be free can't i take away all this pain i try to every night, all in vain   in vain sometimes i cannot take this place sometimes it's my life i can't taste sometimes i cannot feel my face you'll never see me fall from grace something takes a part of me you and i were meant to be"
take revenge on the world and declare your fucking war your war stay gold stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go you want a piece of my fucking time? well back up and back off get in back of the line you want a piece of my fucking mind? well fuck you
"my war serpents rattle when its time to battle (mental midgets)\eye got a fist full of shit for u flies to feast\u lost control of your soul cuz your minds deceased\unfulfilled satisfactions & chemical reactions\my fate there's no escape -- life itself is the assassin"
"twisting & turning\my insides are burning\like larva feeding from the kill\\the pestilence of decadence\i worship my emptiness\i'm ravaged by the damages of this hell"
"at war, once more\peace is another sign that falls\i didn't want to be in war\but it follows me once more\for what, i don't know\i don't understand\can you tell me who has won?\when nothing remains   "
"i've stood by too many goddamn times,\turned a blind eye\i let it pass\but never again, never again\an example will be set\and you will pay your debt to me in blood\\blood for blood   \i'm taking you down\blood for blood   \prepare yourself"
"your heart is made of ash\and you were just a face to me,\a sacrificial lamb\rejection, revenge\deception, dimense\i might be going down in flames,\\but you will burn with me\you'll wish we never took this ride\i just can't forget\the blood,\the stitches,\the bite marks,\the kisses,\the glass memories reflecting back\the suffocating black,\ill milk of regret\just smile and breathe,\tell them: we never mattered anyway"
"daylight dies  blackout the sky  does anyone care? is anybody there? take this life  empty inside  i'm already dead  i'll rise to fall again  i can feel you falling away  no longer the lost  no longer the same  and i can see you starting to break  i'll keep you alive  if you show me the way  forever - and ever  the scars will remain  i'm falling apart  \leave me here forever in the dark"
"i liberate the devils in my head\through the paragraphs crafted by my pen\\these demons drip on the page\my blind multi-eyed children of rage\\i coulda took a bat to the back of his head\or dropped a napalm bomb on the bed as she slept\\but i split\& wrote it down instead\\at least now you know\who you're fucking with\\i'm sick\but i'm free\\you're weak\& i'm built for the siege"
wishing                   missing                how it was before               i fell so sore            missing                   wishing                that i could turn back time            with just a rhyme
going for a long walk anyone that wants to <propfemale> give me a call ill tell you where im at cuz i dont know where im going and i dont know when ill be back
going to sleep
going to school yet again
i got kicked out of school for my every night is poker night at your moms shirt again
lets see if they send me home today for the massive <propfemale> on my shirt
"all is lost again, but i'm not giving in\i will not bow, i will not break\i will shove the world away\i will not fall, i will not fade\i will take your breath away\and i'll survive, paranoid\i have lost the will to change\and i am not proud, cold blooded fake\i will shove the world away"
going for a walk bitches you know my # if you need me
"in my youth the ghost stepped through me, and life was never quite the same\a new dark truth, a cursed recluse, left choking on the bitter shame\i force it down, down, down to the bottom of my soul but i still can't hide\superstition takes control and leaves me numb and paralyzed\and now i realize    "
that she was my biggest mistake
"i'm not like you\your faceless lies\your weak dead heart\your black dead eyes\i'll make it through, but not this time\your hope is gone, and so is mine\live, fight\crawl back inside\sick, blind\love left behind\and i wont live, your weak wicked lie\you pull me in, i'm one step behind\show me where it hurts\and i'll make it worse"
"they bleeding out they nostrils\i'm wicked with hands\\throwing vicious combinations\witness devastation\\i just fucked your soul\annihilation\\feel the sensation\tickle & grow\\spreading over your mind\& taking control\\a <propmale> savage on a rampage\war is all that i know\\feeding hungry heads\defeating all your heros\\<propmale> saves\make the pain\a weapon you can use"
thank you to all the people that wished me a happy birthday and all the poeple that sowed up t <propfemale> with me on my birthday
"this is a war\so youve gotta stay strong and rise above\and never let the motherfuckers tear you away from what you love\gotta fight back and reclaim whats truly yours\take revenge on the world and declare your fucking war"
"to ascend or decline\to retreat or to climb\out of sight out of mind\till attacked from behind\will this fire consume or refine"
"fading, falling, lost in forever\will i find a way to keep it together?\am i strong enough to last through the weather in the hurricane of my life"
"the time bomb is ticking and no one is listening \our future is fading \is there any hope we'll survive?\still, we ravage the world that we love \and the millions cry out to be saved \our endless maniacal appetite \left us with another way to die \it's just another way to die \can we repent in time?"
i give up nothing i ever do is enough for anyone          
why is it that when ever somtings wrong its my fault
