currently wondering why on earth her meal plan assumes that she skips meals on weekends
waiting for homework to magically do itself   not much success yet
8 smile 0 class? naptime? it's probably one or the other   zzzz   
decided to pursue love irl instead of over the internet for a change  it worked out about the same anyways 
"for some reason, computer is 10x as distracting as video games  going to watch people play video games so i can finish my calculus homework already"
is becoming increasingly frustraited with the inability of 90% of people her own age and gender to hold a conversation on a single topic long enough for it to actually become interesting 
rainy days are good for doing homework~ much less temptation to frolic
"why are 99% of the quizzes that i get referred to after completing one like \what kind of prostitute are you?\"" it kinda pisses me off   """
compulsively organizing friends into groups  does it make a difference to anyone but me?
got her first ever #1 online in osu! only to find out that no one cares  crying 
is going to be performing onstage in about two hours   brb having a nervous breakdown t_t;
friday = sacred time when homework does not matter and you can enjoy yourself~  love 
just watched her computer go over limits  how on earth does something take up 140% of cpu that normally uses closer to 40%
shouldn't be on facebook when she has homework she is utterly failing to concentrate on  whoops   
got her test back only to find out that she made the same stupid mistake on every single problem and thus did not do nearly as well as she thought she had  crying 
wifom is win
hell week coming up and i'm already (sort of) behind  i'd best get to work asap
loves aleatory music~ its so much fun to write!
latin has some of the best insults of all  time 
is vaguely wondering what the rest of her hall does while she is downstairs 
went into fangirl mode about a new favorite pairing for ouran host club~ haruhi x kasanoda forever  laugh 
what should i be for halloween?
hates calculus with a fiery passion
why do the children run away when i walk down the hallway? all i asked was if they would like to pet my skull   
is very frightened of her upcoming calculus test
 smile  thank you guys for all of your wonderful birthday wishes that i just now was able to check~  love  college life is so busy d8
i never go online here anymore 
"just found out that the channel that is supposed to be showing lost right now is all static-y and silent  now she can't even watch lost, let alone share it with anyone   "
"welcome to summer\its hot outside, so sunny\makes pruning hard work"
"for some strange reason, waiting for something to happen doesn't actually make it happen any faster   if anything, the opposite "
"almost done surviving finals, yayyyyy"
 love  thanks for the birthday well wishes everyone! i  love  you all~
