"wow, its funny how we all change so much and yet remain the same   "
stuck between a rock and hard place    
why do things that you want more than anything to work just fall apart?
is very lost and sad and heart broken   why do the ones we love leave us?
heartbroken n confused   how can u ever ease the pain of ur own stupid mistakes
my heart hurts <propfemale> much   y cant i fix things
doesn't understand y people including myself can't see what is right before getting hurt  i dont want <propfemale> to get hurt by the devil   
if you love something set it free and if she loves you back she'll come home
missing so many things  memories are always there in my mind  they are driving me kinda mad
being impaled was not on the top of my to do list!!! i highly suggest no one ever does it!
the days pass like years   my mind can only ever think about the same thing and the what ifs n the regret   i need her   
"heaven bend to take my hand theres no where left to turn  lost to those i thought were friends to everyone i know oh they turn their heads embarassed, pretend that they dont see  but its one missed step one slip before you konw it and there doesnt seem a way to be redeemed  "
"~breathe~ and i can't ask for things to be still again no i can't ask if i could walk through the world in your eyes longing for home again but home, is a feeling i buried in you i'm alright, i'm alright it only hurts when i breathe i'm alright, i'm alright it only hurts when i breathe ~melissa etheridge~"
when i think of how you know me no doubts no thinking twice when your smile can be so soothing a familiar paradise when there's no one else that make me whole i am never wanting more i get this feeling i know i've loved you before
"all that i'm after is a life full of laughter without you god knows what i'd do, yeah all that i'm after is a life full of laughter as long as i'm laughin' with you i'm thinkin' 'bout all that still matters is love ever after after the life we've been through, yeah know there's no life after you"
girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes  snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes  silver white winters and melt into springs  these are a few of my favorite things  ~yay <propfemale> andrews!~
"you and me we're the kind of people other people would like to be wand'ring free we present the kind of picture people are glad to see and we don't care that tomorrow comes with no guarantee we've each other for common party and come what may, you and me we'll stay together year after year won't we, my dear  that's why we're you and me  we'll always be you and me we'll always be you and me   victor <propfemale>   "
y cant you just forgive me? i dont want to relive all the mistakes ive made along the way  staind  
the soul needs love and beauty for a soulmate  when the soul wants    the soul waits  bono

"i find it kinda funny, i find it kind of sad, that the dreams in which im dying are the best ive ever had  i find it hard to tell you, i find it hard to take that when people run in circles its a very, very mad world, mad world"
come what may  i will love you till my dying day
so many fears were swimming around and around in my mind who would have dreamed the secrets we would find i've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind we'll be together again all just a dream in the end we'll be together again
