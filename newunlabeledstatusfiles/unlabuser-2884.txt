i wish i was going to cedar point tomorow like my sister but instead i get to go to the zoo   yay  they better have orangutans  smile 
why is it so hard to say what is so easy to feel especially when you know that it's all you think about and all you want
if only you knew=if only you cared
i got to go four wheeling today fun fun  now i cant wait for nationals   soooooooo excited for chicago
im sooooo confused right now  annoyed 
leaving for chicago tomorrow   can't wait til friday for nationals  hope to bring back some trophies  smile  got a lot to think about on the way there but at least i'll be occupied
in chicago!!!!!! its starting to rain though which is making traffic worse and it is not fun   time for nationals to begin  smile 
crazy storm makes for scary driving especially when you have no idea where you're going in a busy city at rush hour
"\what's a hoe?\"" \""ummmmmmm it's a garden tool\"" \""then you must be a good hoe because you actually do stuff in the garden\""-conversation with little sisters(fun fun)"""
uggggh starting driving school   not looking forward to it at all  sad 
driving school is really boring but there is a very attractive guy which makes it better smile  hahaha
"dear psychology,\uggggggggggggh u need to get finished   please don't make me read anymore  i would greatly appreciate if u got finished\love,\<propfemale> \p s  u have four days before <propfemale> beach so if u could make it snappy that would be wonderful"
playing a game with an attractive guy a few doors down   he may or may not be playing wink 
the game has ended sad  time to find a new attractive guy to play with wink 
found a new toy   he's really good at this game which is very cute but it sorta frustrates me cuz he knows what hes doing too
i am soooo upset right now   why did i have to try and be nice sad 
really hopes boo isn't leaving tomorrow   it would make for a very sad day crying  but the game has been fun so far   just hope we didn't lose wink 
boo's playing dirty   this game is starting to get obnoxious lol this is definitely a super fun trip
boo is goooooooone crying 
i think they put something in our coffee      
i thought the last day of vacation was supposed to be fun   
i really wish i could talk to you right now   i'm starting to miss you even though i try to pretend not to   why do i do this to myself uggggggggh
started the long ride home sad  goodbye <propfemale>
leaving for <propmale> soon   can't wait to do some shopping!!!!!!!!!!

finally this summer is coming to an end   i can't wait for school   overall it was not an enjoyable summer
do not want to go to school tomorrow but anyway yay we won   too bad i was not having fun by the end of the game
"there's so much i want to say and i'm afraid i'll never get the <propmale> nor will it matter to you  i know this yet i still can't seem to give up because that little piece of me wants to hold on to the hope that one day i may get a <propmale> with you  it's so hard to give up on something you never had knowing it's everything you always wanted,hoping you one day feel the same way "
"game was super fun   hopefully the rest will be the same laugh  it has been a wonderful week,i think i've actually been truly happy this week   hopefully it can remain that way for the rest of the year smile "
ugggggh i'm soooooooo confused   gotta love being single  annoyed 
had an amazing night  laugh    even though we lost the game annoyed 
"so, this wekend is just turning out to be quite lovely  laugh "
"sometimes, you just can't tell someone how you really feel,not because you don't know why, not because you don't know your purpose, not because you don't trust them,but because you can never really find the right words to make them understand"
"the longer you wait for something,the more you appreciate it when you get it, because anything worth having is definitely worth waiting for"
why do people have to be so confusing? they say things that make it seem as though they really care  then other things make you believe that you don't even matter
"you may regret what you do,but you'll regret what you don't do so much more"
"there was a point when you thought something you now think of a mistake was the right thing to do and you can't change that,so don't dwell on that  simply correct in in the future"
"the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you,yet they seem so far away"
and you're more important than you realize
â€œdo not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for â€�
"\never apologize for how you feel  that's like saying sorry for being real\"""""
"\to be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved \"""""
i wish you actually understood what i am trying to say
