today really sucks  annoyed 
i talk too much to myself & i turn my back on my faith its like glass when we break i wish no one in my place & ive seen you dont need their seeds when the cut goes in deep & im lost in sleep i cant stay in this place i cant stand when the room turns round on my fate you give no guarantees theres no promise i can keep i cant stand i cant see my way i feel blind on my feet i cant stay too long am i wrong?

"i'm tired of caring, i'm tired of getting hurt, and i'm tired of annoyances "
"well if we take all these things and we bury them fast and we'll pray that they turn into seeds, to roots and then grass  it'd be all right, it's all right, it'd be easier that way  or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain like he knew it was time to start things over again it'd be all right, it's all right, it'd be easier that way "
i hate not being able to sleep because all i hear is my brothers stupid techno no matter how many pillows i put over my head   how can he even listen to hours of that shit?!

i have changed my mind about a lot of things!
disappointed 
"this seems to be happening with a lot of people lately and i don't really get why it is so i just have to say, if you say you're going to do something do it! if not then just don't say it!  it's not that complicated!"
"but as i have noticed on more than one occasion, life itself is unfair, and there is no complaint department, so we might as well accept things the way they happen, clean up the mess, and move on "
"imagination movers, you gotta think about it, imagination movers, you gotta talk about it, imagination movers, you gotta sing about it   i think what this situation needs is some imagination!"
"it is so not fun to be outside today, it is hot and disgustingly muggy out with no kind of breeze   i hear thunder and see the storm coming though! gotta let <propmale> enjoy a little bit of time outside today!"
