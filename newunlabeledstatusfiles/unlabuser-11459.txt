"the air is cold crisp and sweet  like the flesh of a ripe apple when you take that first bite   there is nothing to taint is freshness but the smoke curling from my pipe  a shiver runs through me even as the sun blazes in the sky but its warmth cannot penetrate  old man winters grip is strengthening  cold and warmth will battle for awhile, but soon winters dominion will descend upon us, as mother nature watches on "
"there is nothing like the sweet sounds of a childs laughter, combined with squeals of pure delight  all it takes is a toy monkey, or a pony ride on grandpa's back  those little things that draw a tremendous belly laugh over and over  these are the memories to <propfemale>, the ones to tuck away and bring back out when you need a little cheer or perhaps a reminder of the truly important things in life "

"majesty, beauty, the vast e playful anse of lake michigan as it spreads out before me   the sun shines down and the light sparkles and dances on its surface   a sail boat lazily makes its way north and its passengers enjoy the trip, looking forward to the time they will spend at play   a great lakes freighter steams south, commerce, trade, adventure in the hearts and minds of the crew "
"the girl young and beautiful   long flowing auburn hair and the bluest eyes you've ever seen   eyes a more vibrant blue than the sky   they dance with excitement, <propfemale> with love and mischief, when she is angry they turn dark and <propfemale>   in her heart grow plans and dreams for the life that lies ahead "
"you know   you can tell a lot about a person from their flair   some people are very meticulous about the way it is laid out   some don't have a lot, but it is generally about things important to them   others, well   they have a lot of flair, but it speaks about their personality and interests   is there a thesis in there somewhere?"
"a short story that i'm working on   it has potential, but i don't know if i can do it justice "
"frolicing    men just don't frolic   they meander or mosey   sometimes we just walk or, for no particular reason, we might wander   but frolic?!?  that's a little too much like prancing   we don't prance either   we can run maybe ramble or even e playful lore but leave the prancing and frolicing to women and children "
"tonight i stand in the dark, to keep my heart and my soul company   there is no solace there   only despair, despondency and profound sadness    the beauty of the night and trappings of the season should inspire happiness and joy   but, tonight, i feel only the darkness sucking at my being "
"the walls of the garage and the north wing of the house create a safe haven where the snow slowly sifts down from the sky   beyond that small safe harbour, the barren trees are thrashed by the relentlessly cruel wind and the snow is driven through the air like <propfemale> shards of glass "
"the lead gray sky speaks of the \perma-cast\"" that is settling over the upper midwest   the seemingly permanantly overcast skys where each clear day with sunshine is a cause for celebration """

"the snow drifts gently down from the sky, covering the earth in a soft white blanket   the surface is marred only by the tracks of a passing rabbit as it seeks a warm safe shelter in which to pass this cold winter night "
"i love our dog   when we come home <propfemale> is always always super excited to see us! she was so happy tonight, she just started running   i had to smile as she raced back and forth and around in circles   she would run up to us for a quick <propfirst> or rub and then she was off again at full speed   sometimes she wiggles so hard i'm afraid she is going to hurt herself "

i have but one thing to say to my friends and family in indiana and michigan      vote!
"well crap! i went three for three yesterday   three races that i cared about and three candidates won that i really didn't want, won   crap!"
greece is trying to bring spending under control so their government won't fail financially   the populace is protesting those measures   who do they think will pay for their entitlement programs?  do they grow money trees in greece?
spring is waning now   the soft white petals of the dogwood tree slowly fade to the full green leaves of summer   the lilac and the daffodil have had their glorious day in the sun   the peonie and the wisteria stand in the wings knowing their time on stage will soon arrive 
"the smooth green of the lawn, even the rauchious argument between the birds across the street, sooth my mind and rest my soul from the stresses of the day   what a wonderful thing to be able to escape it all in my very own \fortress of solitude \"""""
"plank, dunkler weissenbock   nectar of the beer gods!"

toshiba technical support really put me in a foul mood this afternoon   those bone heads wrould have had me running all over northern indiana for no good reason   i'm not a happy customer 
"a light breeze stirs the trees and creates a miniature down pour in the depths of the grove, while the last rays of the sun illuminate the fleeing storm clouds far overhead   canis <propmale> peeks down through a clearing in the sky and watches as a peaceful night settles over northern indiana "
one of the sweetest sounds on earth   walking through the door and the first thing you hear is your two year pl granddaughter say    papaw!

the valkyrie took flight today   what a wonderful way to commute!
"the peonies and the wysteria have come into their own   but i have a question   does icyhot smell like peonie, or do peonies smell like icy hot?  most of our bushes smell normal, like sweet flowers   but, we have a couple that smell like icyhot   i would dare say, if those were the first peonies that <propmale> had smelled, they would not be her favorite flower "
the ridge has had a bath!  a nice pipe and bellls a ber ale   <sigh>

"i wish i had a friend that would come back in time and tell me how i came up with the formula for transwarp beaming   that would be very cool, and besides that i be <propmale> enough i could retire "

the rain falls striking the leaves of the trees   at first i heard the roll from a thousand snare drums   then as it rains harder i realize that it isn't drums that i hear but thunderous applause   the universal sound of joy and appreciation   mother natures ovation to an act in the play of life 
what a wonderful spring evening to sit on the deck and listen to the song of the tree frogs and watch the dance of the fireflies as they make their first appearance of the season   in the distance i can hear the muffled conversation of some teens playing on the lake with the occasional rauchious laughter of the boys and the delighted squeals from the girls   ah the joy of carefree youth
