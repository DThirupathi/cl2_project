wonders   how some people can call themselves a family when they only want you around when it is convenient to them  where are they when you need them 
"someone once told me that if you hold a shell to your ear you can hear the ocean  if you hold a peanut shell to your ear, can you hear the circus ?"
"why is it when you reach out to your family they always have an excuse, but when they reach out to you your always there?  love  =c"
a wise man once told me: time is our worst enemy because it is the one thing we cannot control  the only thing about time you can control is how you spend it 
"i thought i would never like you, when i first saw you i didn't care but now your in my mind all the time! anyone know how that happened? love "
don't you hate the feeling when you don't want to like someone but you just cant help it?
"when you look at me and i look away, it doesn't mean i don't like you, i just don't want you to see how red my face is  love "
we have a party in house and it hella boring  =[ and like always i'm the weird girl like always
"we see people  with our hearts, not with our eyes\we believe in beauty of the soul, not beauty of the flesh \we believe in individuality, not in prejedice\our souls don't need saving for they are not in peril\just because we aren't saints\it doesn't mean we'll burn in hell    laugh "
"even when i try to forget about you, you always come back  either in person, through a text, a phone call, or just through my mind, its impossible "
