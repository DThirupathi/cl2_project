i'm staying awake to rebel quietly 
i bought sunscreen within two days ago   i'm happy for that   sunburn sucks 
i like that i don't have to worry about studying anymore 
i miss driving to class   i miss eating out 
i'm happy i have music to listen to and internet to read about my family's and acquaintances' lives 
my dancing spirit is suffering   there's pressure to sleep early everyday 
"i understand how an adult knows the world better than a child from my e playful erience with my nephew   but, i still resent my parents anyway "
"though i felt a terrible grogginess this morning from missing my evening psychiatric medication yesterday, i feel more lively right now than in a long time   i did take my morning medication today though "
i am almost ready to start my drive to <propmale>'s bar in victorville 
i feel rested   i started sleep at 11pm yesterday   my insecurities and sleepiness crept into my night at <propmale>'s so i came home   the dance exercise was great 
i get stressed when a cute guy gives me some attention   i'm dancing in my room to let the energy out 
i've had a mellow day today at home   what would you like find on my website that is in development?  i'm using apple iweb to design it   how was your day?
