"so tear me open, pour me out\there's things inside that scream and shout\and the pain still hates me\just like the curse, just like the stray\you feed it once and now it stays\now it stays\so tear me open but beware\there's things inside without a care\and the dirt still stains me"

"45 years ago they spoke out and they broke out\of recession and oppression and they toked\and they folked out with guitars around a bonfire\just singin and clappin,man,what the hell happened?\some were spell bound and some were hell bound\\some they fell down and some got back up\and fought against the meltdown\and their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites\because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it"
"it aint no joke when mammas handkerchief is soaked\\with the tears because her baby's life has been revoked\\the bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the closeup \\mr  wizard cant reform no god,like hocus pocus"
"so dont you sit back,kick back and watch the world get bushwacked\\news at 10 surprise 0 your neighborhood is under attack\\put away the crack before the crack,puts you away\\you need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate"
"so dont delay,act now supplies are running out\\allow,if your still alive,6 to 8 years to arrive\\and if you follow there may be a tomorrow but if\\the offers shun,ya might as well be walkin' on the sun"
