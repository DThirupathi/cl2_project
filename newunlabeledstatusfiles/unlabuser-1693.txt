the darkness exists in all people  there are people who would deny this existence and ignore that which threatens their soul  there are those who become consumed by their darkness and try to use it against the world  then there are those who constantly battle the dark so they may live in the light  which are you?

"dreams, wishes, and light are all frail and can disappear in a moment  sorrow, pain, and darkness are always going to exist  it is not only our <propfemale> to battle these forces but also our responsibilty to do so  never let anyone take your heart from you and always beleive in the more impossible dreams that you have "

creation is just another part of destruction  in order to create something you need to acquire elements that make up the composition of your product  to get those elements you have to take them from something else destroying what contains them in the process  the cycle is unending and thus is the truth behind existence  this process is the center of life and death 
i got to throw grenades and shoot at pop up targets with the army last week  hoping for more fun coming up  graduation is soon and i plan on going to da bronx for a few days  and that is wassup 
i'll be there for you through it all  even if saving you sends me to heaven  it's okay  for you are the ones who have given light to my darkness and meaning to my life  it is for you that i have become the shield that repels evil  i shall be by your side and in your heart no matter the distance 
"so last night the army decided to celebrate the 4th of july like we were still in <propfemale>  there was no giant voice and no base wide email or notification  so the people that are chilling in their tent or trying to sleep all hear these e playful losions and whirring and think that were taking incoming  all in all there was alot of panic, confusion and chaos  so my ideal 4th of july without the good bbq my dad makes "
i think i'm becoming to philosophical for my own good  i'm starting to turn into a wiseman instead of a wise@$$

i think the hardest lesson for us to learn is that you can love whoever you want but you cannot always have who you love  love is the greatest thing in the world when you are in it with that special someone but is the most horrible thing when you are in it alone
