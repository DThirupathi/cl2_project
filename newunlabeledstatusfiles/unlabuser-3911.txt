i was a good day today! i had breakfast with nate and the fam  did walmart and the commissary  made some yummy <propmale> sandwiches and watched salt  now i'm just laying in bed watching locked up and i'll probably be in dreamland soon 
come on pats! you got 11 minutes to pull your heads out of your asses!!
"spring semester starts tomorrow   i have no motivation and i feel unprepared   sad  my house is not as clean as i want it, i still have unfolded laundry, i have a scholarship resume and essay to finish, i have to write a statement for my va claim, my books aren't here yet and about a billion other things  ugh   well life won't wait for me so i better put on my big girl pants and gir-r-done! ok fb, thanks for listening "
first day back to school was fun  i had cognitive psych and interpersonal communications  i really think i am going to enjoy both of them  tomorrow i start nonverbal communications and abnormal behavior 
"ugh, started my thursday morning class   let me start by saying 8 am classes suck! then i have a 2 hour break (well i have about an hour left now) before my next class and i'm finding it hard to fill that time  i'm sure it will come in handy once i actually have assignments but today it stinks "
"getting my hiney in bed! i am so glad tomorrow is friday! i hope <propmale> wants to sleep in because mama sure could use those extra winks   wink  good night fb! oh and to any of my farm friends   can someone please unwither my crops, please "
"i really don't enjoy reading  it doesn't matter how interesting the material is, it makes me feel so sleepy and a little nauseated  its some thing about that black font on the white background "

"done with class for the week! fabulous end to busy day   i got a seat on the packed bus, got in my car and the dropkick murphys were on and now i'm going to pick up my the most awesomest little boy in the whole world!"
being silly with <propmale> today  he is so funny and apparently so am i because i crack him up! it takes my mind off being annoyed because the carpet cleaners were supposed to be here an hour ago and they haven't even called to say they'd be late  rude and unprofessional 
the carpet guys made up for being late   the carpet looks great and they were in and out in a flash 
got some homework done but i've been hooked on locked up  its my normal saturday night but this time its especially good because it locked up maricopa  half e playful ecting to see someone i know  lol
"i love my little man! he is being so good and he is so cute pushing his little school around  my big man, on the other hand, is annoying the crap out of me  lol"
i just ran speed walked 2 <propmale> on and outdoor track  it's 28* (w windchill) out there and let me just add that the altitude here in albuquerque is comparable to <propmale>  i feel like my lungs are going to burst but other than that i feel great 
i just received a great compliment  my nonverbal communication professor stopped me to tell me that i was an excellent listener and that i will go far in life because of it   smile 
going to bed! sweet dreams my lovelies!
what is this two hour delay crap?! just cancel classes!  smile 
*throws her body on the ground and wildly kicks her feet and slams her fists* i don't want to go to school today!!! don't get me wrong   i like going to school   i just don't want to go out in this blizzard to deal with the freezing cold and the idiot drivers  someone call a <propfirst> for me  lol
"so   i went out and started the car to get it warm and i cleared all the snow and ice off of it  i got my son and myself all bundled up in our warmest coats and hats and gloves  and just as i'm gathering all of our things up to walk out the door, i get a text message saying that the university is closed and all classes are canceled  lol i can't really complain   i get to stay home and play with my kiddo all day!  smile "
another snow day  i'm glad i don't have to go out in the freezing cold and deal with the crazy drivers but i feel so unproductive sitting around in my pjs  lol
"man, i'm going to bed   i got to be up super early for school and <propmale>'s got me watching this sad crap on natgeo   making me all boohooie "
so happy for the two hour delay today because i didn't have to go to my 8 am class! all the delays and cancellations have been nice but i can't wait to be back to normalcy   even if that means going to my 8 am class 
my little sister is married!!! congratulations <propfirst> hansen & <propfemale> wells!
sleepy but i have a lot on my mind  i hate that bedtime is always the best time to make a to-do list  lol
we might have a new family member soon! we just visited one of the local humane societies   lot of sweet and cute dogs but unfortunately we did find the one for our family  we are going to visit the city shelter tomorrow and check out the other hs locations online
