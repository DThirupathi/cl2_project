"today was a pretty good day, but i'm pretty sure my probation officer is pissed and wants to put me in jail lol  hahahaha oh well!"
my councilor says i have problems  wink  yay 
"for one hour starting now i will be honest to anything anyone will ask me, inbox me only  copy and paste this to your status and see if you can be very honest"
tomorrow is my b-day woohoo lol 
"tired of this town, i'm so ready to live somwhere else "
"in the end we're all just chalklines on the concrete\\drawn only to be washed away\\for the time that i've been given\\i am what i am\\i'd rather hate you\\for everything you are\\than ever love you\\for something you are not"
"(part3)\hold on to the thought, that it was just,\\and pray for life to continue\\we'll fall beyond safeties grasp\\to re-emerge lifeless\\trying to break from the clutches of our death\\a morbid sea of deepest black, a distant ever burning flame\\a distant ever piercing cry, so far away   "
"(part2)\no miracle will shine its light on you\\so easily directed, your thoughts remain your only guide\\know you will see no truth beneath this cloak of lies\\a distant ever piercing cry   so far away\\blinded by aspirations of a higher state\\wasting your life just searching for a periphery"
"(part1)\the truth became so clear to you, and so your faith has died\\now see what waits for you on the other side\\a morbid sea of deepest black, a distant ever burning flame\\with nowhere else to turn, we wander alone   forever alone\\forsaken by the god you loved, and now your love has died"
"you left behind your fellow man and now have no escape\\there is no light to see beyond the blackest skyline\\first the sound approaches, then the lightning strikes\\lie to yourself and never see the thing you are\\punish yourself until your failure is a scar\\and somewhere inside lies the shadow of the creature you hide"
"atrocities before our eyes\\this crumbling world now lies gasping for air\\and is sickens me to think we will not grow old and die\\before we face extinction   human demise\\as we face the end of days   as the lifeline drifts away\\we're left to face impending immense decay\\the strength of oceans, the blinding light\\the cosmic forces revealing their might\\aeons in slumber awake the rage"
red <propfirst>       
"another day in this carnival of souls\another night's sands end as quickly as it goes\the memories are shadows, ink on the page\and i can't seem to find my way home\and it's almost like your heaven's trying everything\your heaven's trying everything to keep me out"
"we're crushed by the weight of the burden on our shoulders\\relentless pressure to bridge this great divide\\the weak lost in the chasms of despair\\we see the nations crumbling to ash\\fear in control    the screams are everywhere\\now hear the sound of millions running scared\\horrors so dark, this is no nightmare   this is real"
reeeedddd roobbiinn!!!!!
red <propfirst>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"now turn to me and e playful licame ya\just speak to me te lo pido yo\if you live for me pues protejeme ya\now tell me did you ever ask the sky?\not to cry no more,to fly no more\did you ever ask the stars? \not to shine no more,to fly no more"
"accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart  ~marcus aurelius~"
do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for  ~epicurus ~
"is this all that's left? is this all that i am?\escape from this bitter end,that only thought remains, aspire to contend\wander blindly into the night,hope to receive a sign will i survive ?\struck down as i prepare to take this final step\may my reflection fade as i wash away what is left of this life"
"for the animal's soul is mine\we will be completed right before your eyes\i have no control this time\and now we both shall dine in hell tonight\\we begin the hunt and \i feel the power course, as the creatures take flight\for the kill is close and i will be satisfied\for the smell of fear tonight\wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied\you're mine!"
"the truth became so clear to you, and so your faith has died\now see what waits for you on the other side\a morbid sea of deepest black, a distant ever burning flame\with nowhere else to turn, we wander alone   forever alone\forsaken by the god you loved, and now your love has died\no miracle will shine its light on you"
"shaking, burning up with the feverin the realm of pain,\i am the deceivernow i lie to myself, so i can believe her\as she disassembles my lifei cannot dispel the illusion\all my hopes and dreams are drowned by confusion\can i find a way to make a solution that will reconfigure my life?"
"he is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has \~epictetus"
"i've lost all form and unity where has my life gone i'll bring you doom that you can see and bring you down to see you bleed \\and evÂ­eryÂ­one dies and evÂ­eryÂ­one lies \they're waitÂ­ing for the secÂ­ond comÂ­ing again \evÂ­eryÂ­one tries to hold onto their lives \when no one's alive \(bring me 115)"
