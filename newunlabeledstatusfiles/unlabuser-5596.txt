if only the truth were easy to come by and my faith wasn't tested and if i didn't break away from my morals and stand what i want and believe to be right and wrong      maybe i wouldn't let the little things and people that don't matter bother me 
love is aways an answer to everything because to attack someone will cause nothing but problems and the last thing anyone needs is drama
      sleep        
sometimes it takes a slap in the face to wake you up 
it was a good birthday and omg i am 20
oh my brain is mush and i am so confused about life and what i want now > kiss (
life goes on but the last thing i need is to feel bad about myself when i am worth so much
bored out of my mind and i am so sick of bs
maybe it's not a knight that i need to come save me  maybe all i need is me 
wow what a world    i think i'm  going insane
living good living well and in a good mood
i so hate stupid people
moving in tomorrow   well big bad world lets see how i do       playful 
has a smile on and is living life
all smiles  smile 
"clean, work, come home and sleep sounds like fun fun fun"
wooooohooooo day off tomorrow i'm so happy  smile 
sometimes i wonder why people have no respect for each other
oh i'm so tird
i don't want to work anymore i am so burned out  sad 
oh man   perfection i am not but knowing the imperfects i have makes me one step closer to being perfect
"social e playful eriment: if you read this, even if we don't speak often, post a comment with a memory of you and me  it can be anything you want, either good or bad  when you're finished, post this paragraph on your own status and you will be surprised "
ooooh well then
bored   confused     lonely
i feel like running into a wall head first       wish things would slow down for two seconds
*giggles* sometimes i wonder if putting up a status is a good thing or not  smile  lol
so i have written four statuses now      my boredom is getting to me
wooohooo open in the morning up at 5 yay         not
 love 
opened today open tomorrow off at 2 woohoo i'm free for the rest of the day

"omg>>>>>>>> @-'-,---"
the way to happiness     no one knows but all i have to say is       i am very happy today   and that folks is great 
being up till 7 smile 0am when you got up at 6am the morning before is not a good idea
nothing to do and i'm very bored  sad  not cool
going to bed work in the morning idk what i'm going to do       
people are funny    i'm still confused as to what i did to make a woman act like she was better than me      must be the subway uniform or maybe the fact that i'm not a total b****
oh my what a world i live in      sometimes things are just so strange the way they work out even if it's not how you want it to      so happy to be me
sometimes       
so in the end you can knock a witch off her broom but you know duh of course she is cunning enough to get back on
drained of all life      working like i do is not cool     so if you work like i do or harder i'm so sorry
i'm working to the point of death    but it's a good thing
sick   blah
when life is hard smile because sometimes it's the only thing needed to change your whole mood    but for me music singing a song changes my mood and relaxes me so turn the radio up because it's been a long day
i have a day off tomorrow hooraaaay
i am awake and i need to get ready for the day
life isn't perfect but there are some moments that make you step back and say wow look at all that i have accomplished
i have no energy for anything anymore    isn't it sad
