"went to the bathroom at work today  big mistake! after i pulled the door closed, the big metal broom fell in front of the door, inbetween the wall and the cabinet next to the bathroom  no problem, right? not if the door opened in  i had to yell for help through a very small crack in the door  lol i have to admit it was pretty funny "
went to the bathroom at work again today  this time i made sure there was no broom nearby   playful
