homebound on easter!
vacation=5 days of overeating   my belly hurts and my body hates me   sad 
back on the grind   
don't mistake silence for maturity when all you really have is a quiet child 
"when it's wrong, it's wrong and when it's right   you're just in denial "
oooh i think he likes me     makes me want a cheeseburger 
working your life away doesn't add up to much of a life at all 
"relationships are pointless   oh wait, just mine is "
a good night to pass out on the couch in a drunken oblivion   
midnight beach trip
"thanks for all the birthday wishes, love grandma <propmale>   smile "
overate all day   but will not deny myself my midnight buttered popcorn   hello obesity 
"my belly hurts    may have to rethink this \ice cream everyday\"" thing i have going on   """
sleepy time
"cooking, baking, painting, reading, movie watching, and cuddling   the long awaited rewards of a full day off    smile "
bad day?  hello mojitos 
hate your life?  change it 
looking for a little mischief 
looked at my bank statement   will now proceed to cry myself to sleep 
looking for a change of pace   things are getting stagnant 
up until now i had sworn to myself that i'm content with loneliness b c none of it was ever worth the risk   but you are the only exception    
vacation on the horizon     wink 
respect yourself or no one else will 
pretty sure i'm done with north <propfemale> 
oh florida   how i'll miss you   sad 
ready for another vacation 
excited about finally getting some sleep tonight    smile 
day off   driving around til sundown   smile 
"unfortunately, you don't usually know where your line's drawn until it's already been crossed "
tomorrow feels like a barbeque 
went to work 10 hours early today   i'm sure i'll manage to be late this afternoon 
the best way to keep me in a relationship is to prevent me from remembering how much i love being single 
"what could be is a poor substitution for what is and, more often than not, a false prophecy of what is to come "
sick  sad 
meow meow
monday night in   tuesday night drunk 
spent the better part of the day thinking about pork rinds   i've officially hit heifer status 
work  ugh 
midnight beach trip   going to welcome <propmale> in person 
"since the rain has cancelled my plans i'm going to wander around throwing money at things i can't afford   welcome back, debt "
today the dq guy bought me my blizzard b c i didn't have cash on me   his $2 99 has reinstated my faith in humanity 
involving yourself with someone utterly unreliable is throwing your life away waiting only to be stood up 
2 days off in a row!  don't bother calling   i'm ignoring everyone the next 48  smile 
ain't nothing but a chicken wing 
"wine, movies, and a pedi   life couldn't be better smile "
go away laziness; you're cramping my style 
west coast in the am ;p
vacation's over    sad 
your standards don't even make my bottom line 
i'm going to read until my eyes fall out 
aggravating ending to an excellent day   i'm going to bed 
beautiful hiking day with the <propmale> and a belly full of caramel pumpkin pecan fudge   there are few things better than this    smile 
maid for hire   i would appreciate payment for a change though   thanks 
i'm sick and no one will take care of me   ain't that some bull?
i'm on an eating spree   
it's hard out here for a pimp 
sleepy monkey
bored to irritation
"my boyfriend's an idiot   i'm not a ride or die chick, i'm a ride-goodbye bitch, ho "
oh snow   i thought i left you in ohio   stalker 
"sure, i'd love a backrub   now just waiting for the offer    (this could take a while) "
bro bro is in town1  smile 
too often we don't appreciate what we have until it has slipped past our fingers and out of our lives 
"changed a fuse, burned a christmas tree, set the yard on fire   productive morning "
"fresh brewed coffee, sunshine, a good read, and country music - start to a great day "
mmmm   chocolate is nice 
enjoying another day off   alone!
getting lost on a long car ride to nowhere 
"life is too short to waste on petty arguments and unnecessary drama   love unconditionally, forgive quickly, and show those who matter to you how much you care every <propmale> you get "
