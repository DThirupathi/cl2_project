its party weekend in college station!  we're having the red wine and steak festival   not sure about the quality of the red wine--but the men wandering around the festival are sure hot!
"just heard on npr that the blarney stone was voted the \germiest\"" world attraction based on the number of people who've kissed it over the years  not sure what this says exactly--but it was still kinda interesting """
lol!  more from npr   a nude rugby game in new zealand being held to celebrate national nude day was interrupted by a fully-clothed streaker   officials were dismayed about the streakers lack of appreciation of the day 
"after 2 days of fireworks, i think i'm 4th of july'ed out for a bit    love the pyrotechnical displays--but both involved close to 4 hour waits in 100* f plus heat--and i'm worn out!"
up ealier than i'd like to be on a sat--but i want to get an early start to the day   going to the local renaissance fair--it's scottish theme weekend--so there should be lots of interesting sights to see!  just imagine--men in kilts all over the place!  oh wait--it's a renaissance fair--so i guess you should just say more men in kilts than normal!
got a new phone yesterday-an htc inspire  seems like a fun phone- but i hate the long learning curve on figuring out how these things work 
still-getting to watch the muppet show <propfirst> from someone else's you tube account is kinda fun! and i finally found an at&t phone that
gets fm radio! the mustards usually block that so that you'll use their pay-for radio instead! now i can listen to the tv shows at the gym!
but-as you can see-i'm still having some minor problems with the predictive text! smile
