"today was a bad day  i got robbed at the bus stop on my way to work  nigga took my social security card, birth certificate, smartrip, keys, and purse  sad part about it was he had the audacity to bring his bitch ass back outside in shorts instead of pants  it's okay because everytime i see his dirty ass i'ma call the cops til he get caught and when he do i'm pressing charges and taking that ass to court a s a p  "
"finally all the pieces of the puzzle are coming together  tryna have his cake and eat it too  man fuck that, it's like song, \you can get with this or you can get with that\""  which will it be brother """
"man, life truly does throw you some curve balls  i guess though life wouldn't be right without them  after all what don't kill you can only make you stronger  sometimes you gotta go threw the bad before you can get to the good "
"damn, it been a while but feels good to be back  at least for the moment that is  i miss my girls though and you know who you are  can't neither one of you pick up the phone when i call  how rude!"
"so i'm in a much better mood now  i'm not gonna let ignorant people who aren't worth my time upset me  in the end they'll be the ones to suffer, i'm gonna live life and do me regardless "

"q: where you think we'll be in five years\a: to tell you the truth and not to hurt your feelings either but we'd past each other on the street with not even so much as a passing glance"
i always used to be afraid to come out of my shell because i cared what he world thought of me  i made some changes for me and they paid off  never felt so confident in my life  the secret to happiness was inside me the whole time and noni realize that thanks to my two p i c 's  love my girls 4life
"last question of the night\q: why you look so mean\a: i gotta let the world know that it can't bring me down  no matter what others think of me, i'm always gon be me, tiona <propfemale>' <propfirst>  afterall, i am <propfemale> <propfemale> gilham's child and she taught me not to take no bs from nobody"
why is it when i say i want to <propfemale> out you automatically assume it means i wanna have sex with you? two track mind niggas forreal  what's wrong with these dudes nowadays?!

<propfirst> girl where you at? you got me worried! we need phones girl!
"well, no more worries  i feel bad though but it's time for a change  after all, sometimes with love you have to chances  that part of me will never die but this new found happiness of mine is worth the pain  never knew it's be so hard  love sucks sometimes, but in my case, i'm not gon cry cause it's a step forward in my new start "
"i'm missing my baby like crazy! this gon be a long three days without him  right about now i'd be talking to him  oh well, it coulda been worse it's only a weekend  we gon make up for it next week  love you baby!"
i might be the only one who recalls this show on boomerang (my fav channel) but man they was battling for that finish line like i don't know what in this show every episode! <propmale> dasterly was mad as hell each time his pranks turned against him and his dog muttley little dry laugh had me crackin up  that just goes to show cheaters never prosper

"#02 my bestie in the whole wide world! can't believe we five years strong, most of my friends haven't made it past the first year  you are truly my partner in crime, my mother&$@%in sista  love you <propmale>!"
"love is unpredictable and usually is the one you least e playful ect  when we first met, i thought of him more so as a friend but then we got to know each other more and more  eventually friends turned to liking and then to love  i feel like he may actually turn out to be the one  don't ask me why, something in me just feels like it's just right  for once i found someone who fits in my life almost perfectly "
"so friday is my bestie maggz b-day so we're off to fur, then saturday i have to figure out what me and the hubby are doing  so my weekend's pretty full  the countdown begins: two day! the p i c 's and my <propfemale> in the same weekend, can't wait!"
"i mean people have told me some really weird fantasies before but that just took it over the top    just had to put that out there, it's only tmi if i actually say what it is    i knew he was a freak but i never e playful ected that! to make matters worse, my sis bestie just had to urke him on! what goes in that corrupted mind of his sometimes? i still love him all the same   "
a very special birthday to my bestie sista maggz! luv you girl! tonight we gon party! fur ain't ready for us tonight! we gon turn it upside down! lls
"man, i'm sitting here like i got the whole night! i'm still tired but at least i did get like a two hours of sleep  going out with the girls tonight to celebrate my sista maggz b-day! as long as they know i'ma come home and just crash, probably right through the front door  anyway, see ya fb, time to get ready for omg friday @fur w  <propmale>!"
i don't want to break her heart again  i think though it's best if i leave  that way she won't have to worry about me causing her any more pain  it hurts me too but this is the only solution i've come up with  i love her so much so i need to get far away from her 
i still love him    no scratch that i still like him but as far as go    we're done!
"still twisted from last night! missing my left contact lens so seeing half & half (so weird), i got zero sleep on a <propfemale> air bed with a 1 year old that can't keep still (got kicked in the ribs several times) while the one who chose to sleep on the floor complains and yells  what a night! man, at 12 i'm going to sleep for the rest of the day! holla at ya'll tomorrow fb! time to hit the pillow the right way this time!"
