is going to get stabbed(give blood) at 5 smile 0 since she can't get it in before the conference in a half an hour or between her classes 
failed to give blood  her iron was 12 0 when it needs to be 12 5 to give so all she is suffering from is two stiff fingers  lol!!!
is freezing cold and drinking an energy drink before class  ^-^ wonders how she'll act when she sees <propmale> after class  lol! all she knows is that she can't handle rockstar very well 
can't believe she got up so early and can't read  she has to get some food soon because she really needs it today  can't have another yesterday! lol
can't put up with <propfemale> (laptop) any longer  she is only 3 months old and she is so temperamental that i can't take it

finished her physics exam but thinks she did horrible  now she can't wait to eat with <propfirst> and <propmale> tonight then the mini tournament in fencing! yay! she needs some time to relax!
trying to figure out why usfa isn't working for her  it says she has no money in her account when that's a lie but she called the bank and they told her that usfa had taking two membership fee's out when the site told her that there was an error  now she is working with people for usfa to figure out a solution to this problem but has to go to class in at 3:40 
had fun at the tournament! she thinks she did really well after all the trouble and sadness she had to endure today! ^-^ she can't wait until the next <propmale> at competition!! lol
"\how many times can i break till i shatter?  over the line can't define what i'm after  i always turn the car around  give me a break let me make my own pattern  all that it takes is some time but i'm shattered  i always turn the car around\"""""
is starting to wonder if people are misreading her emotions  to one person it looks like one emotion but to her its always the opposite 
is going to try to improve herself in fencing so she can be better in the tournament in december!!! she knows she has it in her to make it happen!
"i''ll push myself to the limits of destruction just to show you, i'm strong "
"is excited to be getting help in today's practice  ^-^ after all, he said she would be able to beat <propfirst> before the end of practice! she really wants that to happen!! lol"
is going to the movies today to see paranormal activity  she hopes she can make it all the way to the <propfemale> without harming herself even worse because her legs really hurt from getting lost trying to find the cvs yesterday  ^-^ she is happy that <propfirst> helped her to find the cvs and not make her more lost!!! lol
can't wait until practice tonight but hopes they have the machine in the laundry room working so she can wash her clothes  she is also going to eat dinner with <propfirst> tonight  ^-^ yay!!!!
"in the end, i shattered and couldn't allow anyone to witness such a vulerable soul  who knew that only two people could break an unbreakable resolve "
can't take the pain anymore  it's to much and i can't handle it alone  something's i can only endure on my own  though the tears can go away anytime 
is sorry for all the worrying she caused  she'll try to mellow down so she doesn't cause more harm to the people that care about her 
is going to try to reach a new goal along with trying the ones she is pursuing now!
"has finally got the membership thing settled and can fencing in december's tournament!!! ^-^ but she's not happy that she has a lot of stuff to do like class, call her mother to get something set up, go to the library to do a project with her group, write type a paper, do some journal entries for english, and color her hair all before tomorrow!!"
has finished with two of her things to do  all she needs to do is write type a paper and do some journal entries for tomorrow  she thinks her hair smells like laundry detergent 
"has class in about 30 minutes, after class she has a meeting she has to attend  finally she's going to return to her dorm and study for the politics test on thrusday!"
thinks that the movie murder com is stupid  it's suppose to be a horror triller but its just not entertaining 
"needs something to be able to function today  she is so tired that she is going to fall off the chair in her pyhsics lab  there is a politics test today, so wich her luck! she thinks she'll do good!"
"has to write three more journal entries then do three exercises before english starts! then at 12 she's home free and can relax all she wants!! call, text, or aim if you want to do something!!"
"is done for the day! call, text or aim if you want to do something!!!"
"is going to watch 2012 in the <propfemale> sunday! if anyone wants to come with call, text, or aim her!"
pretty much just took an ice shower  she's wondering why mcentire can't turn on the stupid heat!!! is it that hard!!! really!!!!!
can't believe she has to wash clothes today!!! that just ruined her sleeping schedule!!!!! plus now she has to go buy so laundry soap for the next time she has to wash clothes 
hopes she didn't offend anyone by leaving the movie night  she is a people pleaser and endured a movie she absolutely hated but was happy when she was texted to go somewhere else  she's sorry for any rudeness that was caused by her leaving 
"is so happy today! she has to study for her mass comm test tonight yes but she got herself two pairs of cute knee socks, new earphones, and a grape soda!!!^-^ brings back memories!!! lol!"
is tired and doesn't feel like studying for her mass comm test! she wants <propfemale> out with people and go to the store 
is sad  when she walked out of dunkin <propmale> came after her to make sure she was okay  well  all she's going to say is that she's not fine  this one problem has got her upset and she has no clue how to address the matter  this is not a break down because she thinks she's worthless its just a break down because the problem got to her 
"woke up to a call from <propfirst> then got ready to go eat lunch with him  now all she has is her 3:40 class at lets out at 5 so if you want to talk to her just call, text or aim  she could really use the company "
is just looking at her profile pictures  she can't believe she ever had long hair! lol! that picture looks really weird since its her with long blond hair and now she has short medium brown hair  ^-^ amazing what a little hair color and scissors can do!!!
has a test to take in health today at 3 smile 5 so she will be out of classes early!!! she also has a little to work on for her english assignment but that will be done soon 
feels sick  she doesn't know if she should go to her first two classes or rest but she needs to go to her last two classes because there is a quiz in the one and a test in the other 
"she hopes she can get it all done, or at least close to finished, before going to dinner with friends and a mandatory floor meeting tonight  if not, then she may have to miss fencing practice tomorrow to finish it  she also needs to type up her pre-lab questions for her 8am physics lab tomorrow! everything is great!"
"has to study for a test in health and type up a paper for assignment 3 that was due today  she didn't know she had her paper theis whole time and could not type the corrections  so now she has to keep working on assignment 4, what she was doing last night and this morning, and type a summary of her interview for mass comm before friday! how joyful is that!"
finished her health exam and she thinks she aced it! now she is going to try to edit assignment 3 and email it to her friend to edit before she has to go eat with some friends  then if no one has anything planned for her she is going to start on her mass comm paper so that its done before friday  her pre-lab questions will be easy so she's not worried about those until later 
is up now  all she needs to do is print everything out and take it to its necessary place  after class she is going to return to her dorm and work on her mass comm paper so that it is done before fencing tonight 
is washing her clothes waiting for her roomie to come back so they can go to the stevenson and work on their mass comm paper so she can turn her paper in tomorrow 
is typing her paper for mass comm! she thinks it would go better if she wasn't so bored! though the paper itself is going rather nicely and smooth 
is finally going to finish typing her paper for mass comm 
came across a snag in her paper  she has 2 and 1 4 pages now and she needs to at least get close to 3 and a half but she needs more information becuase the last few questions in the interview she asked cannot be interconnected  so either she has to bs some of the paper to reach 3 and a half pages or she needs to talk to her interviewee before tomorrow at around 9 so she can add the inffo an print  not happening 
is finished with her paper  now all she wants to do is celbrate!!!! lol! she needs to print it tomorrow and revise if necessary  she also needs to make a rough draft of her english paper so that it looks like she did her homework!! ^-^ that is tomorrow mornings task!!! lol!!!
is up and just started to write her english paper  all she needs to do for the mass comm paper is print her roomie's and her paper out and hand them in  ^-^ today sounds easy compared to the last few days!!! lol she even started to do monday's homework for english so she doesn't have to do it this weekend!!!

waiting for somebody to ask her out tonight  she is so bored!

"feels 20 times better today  she told some people what happened and that's all she needed  though i'm glad <propfirst> brought me home last night because if he didn't, bad things could have happened "

is trying to write a paper but can't find an argument against her topic  she needs someone to play devil's advocate so she can finish her paper 
is happy! she doesn't think she'll write the paper for english until after her prof says that her arguments are strong enough to be put in paper form 
got stabbed in fencing and is now in a massive amount of pain  she has taken more pain killers to try to help but they are not working  she's about to get her ice pack or heating pad

just woke up and wants to go back to sleep 
is so excited that her prof told her that her paper on fencing was good enough to try for the eagle eye  she is going to work hard to make it better so she can try to get new members in the spring!!!
thinks her paper is coming along well but she is still having trouble developing a conclusion and she doesn't think her thesis is fitting quite well 
is finished with the editing to her paper but she just can't think of how to conclude it 
"thinks \oh how i wish this paper was code  it wouldn't be so hard and be finished a long time ago  i miss c++ bloodshed so much!\"""""

"feels sicker than a dog  the doctor didn't give her anything for her swelling or her fever of 102  plus she didn't know how to diagnose her  she said that i had symptoms of the tylenol recall because the allergic reaction she didn't care about, and the flu or the h1n1 but she couldn't tell her what "
thinks she feels better but she knows what that always was like by the end of the day  apparently she is very dehydrated from the dorm being so hot because every time she drank water it didn't seem like enough  well she has class at 8 but she wants to go to bentley and try to get food in her system at before class (7) 
thinks she's getting better  the swelling was gone down nicely but the fever is still haunting her

thinks she has a sinus headache
