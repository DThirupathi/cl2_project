grounded next 6 weeks lol
"grounded next 6 weeks just found out that now it is definate and that i will be moving cross country to spokane, washington one of the most god-awfull places in the whole world god my life sucks but on the upside since they need alot less credits to graduate over there i will be back probably after <propmale> year (i hope) will also be back xmas, spring, and summer breaks fml"
off to school to go get the stupid id photo taken do they really need to be do this shit this early in the morning lol
"was out with kseniya earlier, everything is always so much better over wontons and coffee (sounds disgusting but still) now im stuck at home filling my incredibly boring life with mindless hours on facebook  grounded still"
schedule: 1 ) geometry small 2 )french manse 3 )anthropology andersen 4 ) painting & drawing mo 5 ) global history 2 purciglioti 6 ) honors english barthelmes 7 ) lunch 8 ) chem lab w  barcomb and gym w  <propmale> 9 ) chem barcomb
can't wait to see kseniya and maalik il be the person attacking them in a giant hug lol
when r the dialecticals due for barthelmes if we have any??
still need to finish a tale of 2 cities im debating whether or not i should just watch the animated movie that i have of it
isn't it amazing that you and a best friend can constantly talk about the same thing for 3 weeks then talk on the fone for 4 hours about the same shit and it never gets old lol i luvi kseniya
working on the critical lens essay for barthelmes i hate this shit
just finished my essay so off to bed
hates it when your having a really amazing dream and then her stupid brother comes in and chucks shit at her head to wake her ass up fml
is having the most fun il probably have for the next 2 weeks  i just found out that i'm now grounded till after thanksgiving yeah me!!

9 <propfemale> to go!!!
2 <propfemale> to go!!!
happy new years!!!!
2011 as long as your better than 2010 you can stick around 
here's to another year of not accomplishing any of the crap i said i would  woo go 2011!!!
i'm out
"this be my lasy week here so im in like a depressed mode so if i do any stupid shit, don't mind it im shur the was a perfectly reasonable e playful lanation for it"
this be my last week here so i i act like a dumb ass or do stupid stuff then just ignore it im not in my right mind then  love 
computers and cell phones will be the death of us all
"in case any of you people out there actually care this was my last week here at hen hud, i will officially start at <propfirst> j in wappangers on monday fml"
just had my first day at the new school  how many more days left untill i graduate?
"ha no school today this is pathetic seeing as how there's barely any snow, but hey! i'm not complaining"
i just went out sledding today on some golf course and totally busted and froze my ass   
chipper today    its warm enough where i don't feel like crap   hope it stays like this
apparantly some people find it rude to take one's fork and shove it in the middle of a birthday cake because their sister got pissed off and wouldn't give it to them  this is only being judged on the fact that i was then literally covered in chocolate cake and frosting from head to foot  lol
"just found out my facebook horoscope for today, apparently im supposed to be aligning myself with smart people   "
the fact that facebook is being stupid and i cant put up my new pics cuz of that
it's so beautiful out that i'm in a great mood  love 
have officially memorized all the lyrics for the real slim shady--- man i love this song
weather is still beautiful and i think i'll go out for a run soon

<propfemale> xmas everyone!!!!!
trying to save the world is really hard when the stupid death eaters and dementors keep getting in my way  once again proof i have no life lol 
people spend too much time worrying about what others may or may not think  why do you care so much? do what you love because you love it and stop worrying about what the other dumbasses in your life might say 
why when i'm listening to metal on pandora does it eventually go to all this light crap?
crap i totally forgot about the facebook holiday that was yesterday  i was really looking forward to it 
your a wonderful what?
just saw a commercial for some gnome movie  they're taking over!!!!!!
man i love this inclement weather 
be protected from mayhem like me  lol
have my speakers way up just to tune out the silence
"lord of the ring marathon, hell yeah!!!"
remember that when your eating your chips ahoy 
"\why am i so uptight today the paranoia is all i have left\"""""

wtf why did this tard band win album of the year? eminem should've won or at least lady gaga  this shit doesn't compare to their music ability 
having one of those rambo moments today 
"how's about we go all the way back to the friday right after school, when we still had a whole break"
so confused right now
