i'm here    
this f***ing shit sucks i really can't fucking stand the irony of life i really do hate this    *sniffles
i honestly don't know today    
trying to get better    don't know why my mood is killing me    i need distraction in life     
today is going to hurt physically and metally this time   
     i'm okay   
is still wondering   
"tired, duty, and way to many things going on through my head about this weekend with medic  still need to fix what i thought i fixed  not an improvement unfortunately but i am getting there "
nevermind found out i still have duty until tomorrow after work  i just hope my relief actually comes through this time and doesn't leave me on post 
i just want to be relieved before i nap on the desk   
medic is almost here    and he just checked in to facebook so now he can see this site to 
happy 4th to all my sweethearts  i hope you enjoy it

with my baby for the weekend now that he's awake lol    love you sweetheart 
just getting by   
we keep fighting everyday in this world knowing we might still lose yet we fight everyday knowing we could win  the battle is never the hardest but it is the biggest part of it  the outcome is truly what makes or breaks the person    (personal thought)

"to feel the pain of a thousand waves crashing onto a lonely rock out in the middle of the ocean is a pain so many can feel  but on my rock the light in the lighthouse has broken  i only hope to replace the light to help leads the way, otherwise the boat h"
"to always wish the dream was a reality, to be where you want to be, to see who you want to seem and know that everyday you are happy with the life you have   "
"everyday in our lives something changes, whether it be our mood, our actions or the way we think  they affect us in many ways whether it be good or bad and they affect those around us  what will change next?"
"i want to break free of the nest and i want to fly like a bird, i want to live for the life i should own  hit me up if somethings going on tonight    i don't know i am bored as i write this   "
last night was pretty cool made a new gf and danced most of the night  just chillin at friend's house watching movies about to eat breakfast 
"can you ever truly define love in this world, or, can you truly ever find it, and when you do is it already too late?"
when life turns a blind eye to you and leaves you alone where or who do you turn to?
name your favorite alcoholic drink in preparation for the weekend  payday!
just getting by as the sun rises and sets each day knowing it will be too long before the pain goes away   
so as the bad news gets to only worse i try and keep my head high until duty ruins what hope i had of drinking it off and its reserve weekend to    *sigh
off to the naval reserves    not really just have to babysit them all at work on a saturday    figures with my luck   
okay so the reservists are gone (system is still down globally) but now chief's got me doing worksheets for the war college now    *sigh
i love penguey   
getting ready for the turnover  can't sleep as much so i'm ready for the break 
"i think i upset my medic, i'm sorry baby    i really need to loosen up on swearing sometimes, i don't mean too i just do it out of habit and short temper "
going to see my baby tonight  all i have to do is just get through the day  hope i can make it 
"i just want to see my baby, why do they do this to us all we want is to be together and they keep us apart    "
stupid fucking people on my mind again  i just want to pull through everything and make sure to get things right especially since my *death e playful erience* again 
just ready to go home where i belong 
"going on leave today to finally spend more than 3days with the husband won't be back for 2 weeks  going to va, nc, and fl  take care everyone enjoy the weekend "
disney was wonderful and i took lots of pictures  should be heading up north soon  i will be sad once it ends 
"good luck everyone on the exams tomorrow, i'm sorry i won't be there with you guys but this time my happiness needed to come first   love "
just wishing that my total bliss would not come to such an abrupt end as the sun sets passing the day 
after a little bit of a hold up here in va i will be home soon aka tomorrow 
i think i've lost my way and i think i may need help     but i just don't know how or where to go   
is wondering who went wrong and started all this    
"for anyone who has an xbox live account and actually plays please note me  i am on xbox live and play frequently and would like a pal, note please "
"i am sorry, *sniff i really did try    "
"please let me cry, i don't want to be violent   "
       
i'm done! ><  thats it sentence me now because i am f***ing through 
"thank goodness, he helps otherwise i wouldn't be here    "
feeling a little better now but last night had me worried 
"*cries i miss him so much, my good cookie is not worth so much heartbreak and pain    "
"we really do hate \them\"" sometimes   """
its all my fault i'm miserable i let the fucking comments that everyone tries to say behind my back get to me  i try not too but when you are barely hanging on its kinda hard   
just found out my baby won't be here    again  i can't stand how these days are getting worse and worse 
if you can't come here i will leave and go to you   
please  i beg you    just bring me thursday so i can have my day off on friday   
so happy right now i'm on special <propfemale> and my baby is almost here  i'm so happy   smile 
i don't want him to leave    can't i just go with him   
my baby's gone  i miss him so much  i'll be waiting for you baby 
can't wait for my medic to be back  i love him so much   love 
so i have decided that the spider bite (brown recluse more than likely) is not worth my time no matter how many symptoms i get  if i get worse i can always go back to the hospital who said it was no big deal and show them my eaten arm  for now though i will be the tough cookie 
spider bite gone now i have a small crater on my arm  smile  guess i won't die after all 
"i love my baby, if only he didn't have to leave  can't he just transfer here or let me go to him?"
"so i have decided that if you do not like me i do not care  take me off your friends list, don't just keep me for the games  i do not want a comment or reply on this post cause i'll delete it  i am through with stupidity and suckups, i am through with people who say they care but they don't  i am not a hookup, i am not stupid, and i don't appreciate it  for those who keep me i love you guys and will keep in touch  love "
i just want this over with    
so i have decided that the navy finally won after 4 years and in 8 months i will be back in <propfemale> as a navy wife rather than a navy sailor  i love baby i'll be home soon 
i'm so tired and sick of working  is it august just yet?  *so i have decided that the navy finally won after 4 years and in 8 months i will be back in <propfemale> as a navy wife rather than a navy sailor  i love baby i'll be home soon
enjoy the thanksgiving weekend and get ready to start decorating for the winter

my baby's here with me today and it's his birthday can't wait to celebrate it and i got a sexy date on friday i can't wait  i'm actually excited!  smile  <propfirst> stephenson lady <propfirst>
"enjoyed every last second of my husband's birthday, i only wish we could of had dinner  i'm hungry now  i love my baby "
"i don't want my baby to go  i won't see him until possibly christmas  i'm going to be so l alone without him  baby don\t go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
so my baby's gone  i almost cried but i'm trying to be strong for him  hopefully i have a goodnight with the girls at the nhcne holiday event  time to party corpsman!
"had an awesome night with the nhcne crew, i actually loved tonight for once and felt good but the slow dance was what made me cry without my baby here for me "
getting ready for hopefully an awesome night  posted nhcne christmas party photos for everyone 
it just really hurts sometimes    
so i have decided today that i really do hate being here and can't stand the way life has treated me this past year  i just want to go home back to where i belong  is that too much to fucking ask for!!!!!
a special thanks goes to baby travel today for all her help  we love you baby travel! ? <propfemale> sacrey
"talked to the detailer, as of right now next orders take me to vaw 123 (squadron in norfolk attached to the enterprise), so it comes down to either a  take the orders once they print and keep my job or b  get out in augest at 4 years and try to find something else      "
"i can't wait to get away from all this pain at least for a few days  i love you medic and i can't wait to see you baby, you are worth more than any holiday gift i could ever recieve  <propfirst> stephenson"
"feels so good to be home where i belong away from the madness  even though i am sick i am still the happiest i have been in a while, thanks boys "
happy holidays to the best of you i wish you all the joy and happiness in the new year 
"enjoying every moment with my man, dreading the return home though  i shouldn't have to leave this place "
wondering what will happen with the new year   
i'm just glad its almost over and i can finally relax   
why is it i can only have my perfect world for a few days at a time?
i still have to download penguey's winter photos but i just love xbox live to much to want to quit 
"nothing hurts more than watching your husband cry and beg to stay just because he can't stand to leave you behind and wants nothing more than to be by your side  i miss him so much, i just want to cry   sad "
"i'm just so bored with life here  i just can't wait to get to the squadron, then i'll be exactly where i want to be "
if only this was easier than what they made it to be    
penguins!!! *penguey waddles around the room*
i can't wait to see my baby tuesday i hope he drives safely with the weather 
so today i will have to face the one person i thought never to have to face here  i could take on any officer (navy or law enforcement) in the world except one    my dad     
i can't wait until tonight i got my medic on his way  i'm so excited   love   love 
i think i'm dying but i'm not sure just yet  i'll let you know  i'm just bored and don't want to be alone especially with my baby gone

"if you have a wonderful husband, fiancÃ© or boyfriend that works hard to provide for you & would do anything just for you & your family, then repost this as your status to give the honest well behaved men out there the recognition that they deserve            because great men are few and far between, and i have one  ?"

i hate this so much    just f*cking transfer me already!!!!
*sigh* i just want a hug    :`(
sometimes i wonder if i am a horrible person because of the things i do and other times i find myself thinking why do i care    is it wrong to be this way and if so how do i change it?
i don't know what to do tonight?
"i just wanna get through these next few months without punching someone in the face so please don't test my <propfemale>, i haven't gone through anger management yet "
rhode island sucks! >< no <propfemale> in wonderland showing except providence place mall at midnight and i don't drive  friday doesn't even look hopeful of a showing in the local area  this really f*cking blows and i wanted to dress up too  next time i'm going to va  at least there i'll be able to see it on time 
"\what the fuck is wrong with me?? please    somebody help me    i don't what to do anymore   \"" -secret teller"""
"trying to get the help i need for myself, please don't bother me about it too much  i just want to get the help i need at this point and get through what happened "
hubby is on his way up to help me out  i really love that man  the things he'll go through for me makes everything so worth while  i love him so much  love 
hubby is here to help me out    i'm so lucky to have him pull me back from such a hard time  he really is my medic who saved my life  i love you <propfirst>!
"hubby is gone now and back home  damn i miss him so much  i love him too much and i can't take it  *sniff sniff cry :,("

is it really that fucking hard to understand!!!!
went out and cut my hair and added small color to it  definitely miss my old look but hopeful for the new one  hopefully it won't be a problem anymore  new pics posted 
stressing out way to much you would think it would have killed me by now  still crying through though  i can't wait for this to be over   
    i just want to go home    i am starting to not care about how i get there either   
just had a long <propmale> potter filled night  just missing the hubby right now though as we chat on skypey 
hitting up xbox live tonight  up for a match? heartandenvy is the tag so hit me up

i'm so bored today and i have to finish cleaning and packing for the weekend  i'll see you soon mommy 
"why did the navy have to do this, it's not fucking fair to mess with people's lives without asking first? unless i ask you for help directly don't fucking put your foot foward!!!"
alright i got my very first set of stiches today  hooray!! i was so excited i even got to watch and didn't feel any pain  now if only they could tell me what i actually have this time rather than guess  i don't want this soon-to-be scar all for nothing 
my stiches are killing me i just want to get this week over with and get them the f*** out  it stings! not only that but dealing with the car debate again and its killing me 
"alright my status is opened to the facebookers to vote  i am getting a new car but trying to officially decide what to get and how to get it  so let's hear you thoughts on type of car and how to purchase (ie: <propfemale>, dealer, used, etc   )  start!"
most things in life neve really change at all no matter how much you hope they would  and man that is a f*cking let down at times     too bad    
so what is everybody doing for easter?
happy easter everyone! hope you all enjoy it no matter how you celebrate the day 
it sucks when the holidays come around and you can't see the one person you wanted to most  i miss you so much <propfirst> stephenson  i can't wait to see you soon   love 
i love my baby <propfirst> stephenson he means the world to me and no one could ever replace him (except penguey maybe)  smile  just kidding!
my poor baby left this morning  it just sucks after over a month of not seeing him it sucked having him for only 3 days  they better let him come visit later on this month  i just want to transfer already  i miss too many people down there 
"i am ready to go already  i am starting not to believe or care about what \the other\"" people think anymore  can't it just be summer already?"""
through and through it all i have found out only 3 and a half months left  my orders posted to vaw 123 in norfolk  i'm finally going to the only place that has ever felt like home  this is all almost over i can't wait 
"? ? if you have a husband that makes you laugh, that you can say is your best friend, who you want to grow old with, who always picks you up when you are feeling down, who is your world , and a man that you can thank god every night for, copy and paste this to your profile with your anniversary date! ? ? 04 21 2009 (next week)"
actually enjoying myself right now  its a nice feeling to have and i'm learning things that are actually helpful for me  thanks <propfemale> e arriola you're the greatest 
i finally know what home i am getting     i hope  just hope its available once i get down there  working on my googly list still but i'm getting there

"so today is april 21, 2010 which means we have officially been married one year  congrats <propfirst> stephenson we made it now if only we it could be a year together  lol i love you so much baby happy anniversary   love "
felt bad i didn't talk to <propmale> much but i will get to spend my weekend with him and that matters more to me than anything  i can't wait to hold him again  now if only the week would end quicker 
i can't wait until tomorrow night i get to see <propmale> and that's what matters to me more than anything in this world 
i can't wait my baby will be here soon  sucks i have to work this weekend though  i wish i could just spend it with him rather than with him and my office  at least i have him though and that's what matters 
my baby's here hooray! now if i could just get out of this damn office and i'll be good 
"nothing hurts more than watching him walk away, not knowing when i will see him next  nothing hurts more when the one person you want to be with wants the same thing, and yet you can't be with them  i miss you <propfirst> stephenson i can't wait to see you again soon "
i hate this i'm not sick but i feel sick and its driving me crazy! make it stop!
i just wish some things were different  maybe then    it would be right    maybe   
officially 3 more months and i am back in <propfemale> where i belong  i can't wait  smile 
i just want this month over with    i have too much on my mind for me right now

"this is going to be long but at least its fun  you id card people make it worth it  <propfirst> calhoun <propfemale> west i hate this weather though, such a killer "

"poke me , if you've had a crush on me ; like this status if you think im cute or inbox me if you want to have a relationship , now let's see who is brave enough to copy & paste this on there status also i was bored so this helped!"

"will you really miss when i'm gone or will i be something else    \a scattered dream that's like a far-off memory  a far-off memory that's like a scattered dream  i wanna line the pieces up--- yours and mine \"""""
through alot of tough choices i have come down to this    soooo     i have decided i am re-enlist  it will be on 30th june and i am relieved i'm almost done here 
"finally uploaded new photos, the newest ones won't be done until tomorrow  also just sent out invite to re-enlistment  nothing big just small and simple on jun 30th at 1530 in swos building "
"i'm so excited for tomorrow, this will be a good weekend busy saturday and lazy sunday i can't wait for this  re-enlistment wednesday and one month left here "
awesome time saturday with <propfirst> watching shen <propfemale> (very nice dance) and seeing the water fire show in providence  now its just a lazy day to clean up and relax for a bit 
does anyone else have xbox live or skype and would like to add? just updating my lists and wanted to see if i miss anybody 
"household goods shipment is july 19th, i'm so excited  now if only my stress would lighten a bit then everything would be better "
"so i finally re-enlisted today  didn't feel any different, just another day  household good is the 19th and i still don't have my tis signed yet  back to the drawing board in the morning if i ever get to sleep tonight that is  its gonna be a long night "
"depression is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long  put this as your status if you know someone who has or has battled with depression  will you leave it on your status for at least an hour? most people won't, but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer, at some point in our lives "
please tell me i am not the only one trapped on this island for the whole weekend  is anybody out there? i'm looking for things to do  hit me up!
last night was too long of a night and i still ended up awake at 9am this morning  its going to be a long weekend 
the funny thing is it doesn't feel like a weekend at all  i wonder why?
"this is a day to thank your military, not for a day off (for those that are) but for your freedom which we fight for everday  whether you are a soldier on the ground, a sailor out to sea, or an airdale in the sky my respect goes out to you  happy 4th of july!"
i offcially have less than two weeks before my things ship out and less than one month and i'm gone from newport  hooray!!!!  smile 
all right playtimes over hitting up xbox live now   
can't sleep but at least all my stuff (as well as myself) are almost out of here  can't august 2nd get here any faster 
never thought i would hit such a high level of stress in my life ever but at least one good thing came out of today  right <propfemale> k dias?
is it wrong to give your number to someone because you're nervous they won't let you in on the base but think you know why they wanted your number?
enjoying the weekend so far with <propfirst> zuehlke  but more importantly the world cup final is tomorrow  who do you think will win spain or the netherlands?
fifa world cup going down spain vs  netherlands  let's go spain!
fuck yea!!!!!! spain wins the 2010 fifa world cup yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"my phone is a shit bag so if you call and i don't answer after 2-3 hours again it's the phone not me this time i've missed 2 calls and 3 texts due to this thing  also, its official i have 3 weeks left here in newport! yea!!"
can't sleep again but hey at least i'm almost done getting stuff together for the movers  just another week to go before my stuff is shipped out 
can't seem to figure out how to organize my clothes and thats the last thing before packing my car this weekend  i'm excited freedom is 2 weeks away!!!!!  smile 
household goods have been moved and almost done with the rest of the boxes  july 30th is almost here 
just getting there while wondering how much i really have changed the past year and a half in newport 
i just want to get through the week  too many bitchy people at work and way too many things running through my mind  10 days and a wake up to go!
too many sleepless nights and i'm pretty sure tonight will be the same  at least i can sit outside and draw all night  too many things haunting my mind to sleep anymore 
"you said \f*ck you\"" behind my back and i heard you  why don't you tell me how you really feel to my face  that way after i'm done realizing how much of a lie you've become i can say \""fuck you harder\"" to your face  this is my life deal with it!"""
"*watches tower fall* freedom is on the horizon with one week of hell before reaching heavens gate  great weekend; drank with the boys fri & saw salt, chilled with my girls sat, spent sat night with friend in er bonding, & <propmale> out with my friend today  life for once though stressful is actually good "
so i have decided that this week better go by fast  i can't wait to go  vacation has been planned  dates are 2-15 pending return date  might bring days back further but we'll see  i'm excited and i think it might be setting in soon   smile 
i keep breathing and thinking to myself less than a week to go  its kinda hard when you temper is at the breaking point and all the emotion you have left to feel has hit and all time low on the dragons scale 
so today something happened i did not e playful ect  i got my very first naval achievement medal because i saved <propfemale> k dias from choking but too me her life meant more than any award i could ever get  love you girl!!!
"2 more work days & 5 days of newport, ri  goodbye dinner for myself & <propmale> <propfemale> who is leaving psd for nuwc also on friday will be thursday at 6 smile 0pm at batik garden chinese buffet  everyone is invited (well maybe not everyone)  but just a small bye for us so if you're interested hit me up before hand so i know "
its kind of ironic how time always seems to put you into certain places at certain times of life  the only thought that goes through my mind is what will become of me next life 
this is it  last day of work     few more minutes to go  don't even know what i am doing yet this weekend  anyone got any ideas?
so went and did scrapbooking this morning and just purchased new camera  still have to clean but tonight i think i will stop to drink and play videogames before bed  still don't know what i'm doing for sunday yet 
one more night and its over going to see what i have left of mansions today with <propfirst>  should be a nice days to finish up an awesome weekend
