â€œdon't rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth  only you can be responsible for that  if you can't love and respect yourself - no one else will be able to make that happen  accept who you are - completely; the good and the bad - and make changes as you see fit - not because you think someone else wants you to be different â€� ~stacey charter~ (thx august)
