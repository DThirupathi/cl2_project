"depression is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign that you have been trying to    be strong for too long  put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression  will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour? most people won't, but it's mental health week and    1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point "
"when you <propfemale> the bible, satan gets a headache  when you open it, he collapses  when he sees you reading it, he faints  when he sees you living it, he flees  and just when you're about to re-post this, he'll try to discourage you  any takers?"
