"you can see my heart   beating you can see it through my chest i'm terrified, but i'm not leaving i know that i must pass this test so just pull the trigger      say a prayer to yourself he says close your eyes, sometimes it helps and then i get a scary thought that he's here, means he's never lost"
kisses don't no they don't never don't lie you can run if you want but you cant hide telling you its the truth don't you ask why kisses don't no they don't kisses don't lie emotions come and go who knows how the wind will blow? there so little in this world to trust in seduce themselves with lies some don't realize they call it love but its really only lusting
when it comes to my heart i dont play baby boy cant you see the stop sign your movin much to fast baby love doesnt grow in a day just get it right the first time make this feeling last
baby if your willing to wait we just take our time dont you know that its getting late and i know whats on your mind i know this feeling is crazy its mutual baby but we dont have to rush something real baby if your willing to wait we can just take our time
these are just parts of songs they dont reallly mean anything

â€œto be your friend was all i ever wanted; to be your lover was all i ever dreamed â€�
"if it's not real you can't hold it in your hand you can't feel it with your heart and i won't believe it but if it's true you can see it with your eyes or even in the dark and that's where i want to be, yeah"

part 1-   love is our true <propfemale>  we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another  we do not discover the secret of our lives merely by study and calculation in our own isolated meditations 
"part 2-   the meaning of our life is a secret that has to be revealed to us in love, by the one we love  and if this love is unreal, the secret will not be found, the meaning will never reveal itself, the message will never be decoded "
"part 3-  at best, we will receive a scrambled and partial message, one that will deceive and confuse us  we will never be fully real until we let ourselves fall in love - either with another human person or with god "
my whole life i have been searching for my <propfemale>  mainly the guy i am destined to be with for all eternity  i know thats a long time  well i think i found him and i plan on giving him my whole heart  i hope he accepts it   love  <propmale> <propmale> do you accept it  laugh 
"shawty's like a <propfemale> in my head that i can't keep out got me singin' like na na na na everyday it's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay"
i feel like i want my voice back now             
tea is soooooooooo yummy  laugh 
i cant wait for you to come see me  laugh 
i will never let you fall i'll stand up with you forever i'll be there for you through it all even if saving you sends me to heaven
i just wanna be happy  laugh   i am happy with just being me
i wish true blood was back on and i had a tv  also i want 4 time to go faster 
somehow everything's gonna fall right into place  if we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday  if only time flew like a dove  we gotta make it fly faster than i'm falling in love  this time we're not giving up  let's make it last forever
"oh <propfemale> fall down on me let me make a wish upon you hold on, let me think think of what i'm wishing for wait, don't go away  just not yet  cause i thought, i had it  but i forget "
