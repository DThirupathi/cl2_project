"the dynamic between beliefs and values is a powerful one   unaligned, not much happens   aligned, amazing things happen effortlessly   beliefs can change in an instant, but values tend to remain more constant   so it's better to challenge beliefs than values to create the alignment   it can be a hard thing to do   but it's where personal strength and success live   "
"the best part of what i do is that i get to talk with business owners about what's going on in their businesses, and provide them with a sense of hope that there is a way to get to where they want to be   it's the best feeling in the world, and i\ve gotten to do that a couple of times in the last few days now!"""
