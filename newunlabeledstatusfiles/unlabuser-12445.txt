just got on and figuring everything out!!!
holy crap i need a energy drink badly!!!!! have a great wednesday!
"if patients is a virtue, then why are there so many of them that have to wait so long at the hospital?  sorry long day and tired night"
i'm really glad i don't believe in coindences anymore      
i always hate the game of having to act like i don't care about a situation when i do 
"going to great lakes crossing at 2      new shoes or new music, or clothes     we are talking big decisions here     "
for the most part good weekend    i'm so thankful to have some great people in my life   have a good week everyone!!!
"business first, christianity second!"
day off for me!!  catch up on sleep and do some cleaning   and <propfemale> out later with this crazy musician     wink 
"just got back home from the best night ive had out since i can remember! the opera, all dressed up, with the woman im in love with! thats my praise report!  smile "
hey to everyone im selling my laptop for anyone thats interested  message me or get a hold of me 248-277-2458
"im getting real sick of people not working with me either cause they feel threatened by me or because of my age, ive paid my dues around here and earned my position, we're suppose to be a team!"
"yay i think im getting walking pnemonia again  i started getting hot and cold yesterday  i cant afford to get sick, literally "
"so, im really not feeling well at all with having chills and being congested but what a great night at church and a great night just watching tv with my girl  how great god has been and is!"
yeah   nothing like a lightning bolt right outside your house as an alarm clock!
"yay   somebody hacked my cell phone account and had a rebate check sent to them instead of me, which i was depending on! this will not get me down! however, i would like to meet whoever did this "
what a great day off! got things taken care of and just knowing how blessed i am everytime i look into her eyes being sober 
it gets very frustrating dealing with grown adults who think and act like they are in the fourth grade  sometimes i wonder how i have done it for a year now 
a beautiful day for having 1 year of sobriety!
"im really not getting the fact that they raise rent on those that actually pay their rent and on time, and at a time when we have an opportunity to get health insurance  i need and want it but i just cant afford an extra 200 a month with rent being an extra 40 and ins  being 160  eghhh    "
im just always trying to do the right thing around here and hopefully doing what i know to be right didnt get me in trouble    just praying on it 
"well, i got my fafsa processed, so now i just have to go and enroll at occ  wow, im finally setting goals in my life and acting on them!"
"just because we get sober doesnt mean we keep the same mentality of an addict  we also should have some ambition with our lives  give me strength to deal with these individuals cause im about done with it, seriously "
â€œevery saint has a past and every sinner has a future â€� -<propfirst> wild i copied this off a maggies <propfemale> and thought it was cool 
worst day off ever    
"what i thought i knew i dont, now i just dont know anything   "
"<propfemale> and i just got out of <propfirst> pilgrim vs the world, what a uniquely awesome movie  even though i started dozing towards the end due to sleep deprivation, it was still worth the $19  see it!"
"i really cannot wait to be up north tomorrow for a much needed vacation, and not just a day or two off  first time i will be back at my parents cabin too "
everyday is alot better then it use to be knowing i was plucked from the fire when i didnt have to be!
"so, i went to a second interview this morning and now im just waiting for a call back  fingers crossed and praying that i get it!!"
ugggghhhhh
"yeah i know everything happens for a reason, but im still upset "
its really awesome to get threatened by someone going through the mission because they need to follow the same rules like i have to follow  ive just about had it with pain and stress 
it really sucks when you feel like god isn't listening    
sitting in my docs office with no appointment  its going to be a long wait    i need to get a neck replacement! has medical science progressed to that yet?
"well, got another call back! so, im sitting and waiting to go in for another interview! i really hope i get this one, it would definitly be a step in the right direction "
you reap what you sow  people dont drink and drive because a dui is nothing comparable to what could happen  and those ramifications can last a lot longer than you think 
"so, im running the children's worship this sunday, and im thinking i want to do something involving why god lets us go through painful events and trials to strengthen us  anyone know where i can find scripture to back this up??"
why is it so frickin difficult to get some relief in my neck? im suppose to have a epidural done this morning and the doc decided he wasnt coming in!! im about to frickin lose it    
"ya know i hate complaining but when it rains it pours  so, ive been in horrible pain because of my neck and this morning i had my rent money in my back pocket so i go to grab it and it isnt there  ended up driving back and found the envelope on my porch empty  im so blessed by god for having such a better life than the old one but it ijust seems if its not one this its another    "
i have orientation at my new job tonorrow and am very excited about!!!
"im really trying to walk trustfully, but it seems everything i do or think i accomplish, it ends up back firing  of course, its many things right at the sametime     "
all the news or things that happen to me lately seems to just be bad     and more to come im sure 
"whatever i try to do right, is always wrong evidently "
cool! i just found the game axis and allies pacific version at the store!
"how come nothing can ever go right? how also can nobody give an accurate time when something is suppose to happen? just tell me when it will happen and i wont be mad, its upsetting when im told a certain day and it doesnt happen  just pissed about stupidity at the moment "
all i try to do around here is be honest and up front about everything but because everyone else shoots moves then i must be doing the same    ***frustration***
i come from a long line of sinners like me 
"so, i was just told that i should move off seneca by dec  1, what to do now    cause i don't know           "
ugghhhh     stressed  give me the strength!!
"ya know what? i've been stressing myself out way too much lately and i really don't like it  at this point its out of my hands so, what happens, happens! i'm just happy and thankful for what i do have in my life today,  especially, knowing where i came from "
no more!!
"so, a year and half ago i was hopelessly addicted and lost and tonight im enjoying the nutcracker at the detroit opera house with the most beautiful woman ive ever been with! there is no other place id rather be! *thankful for everything*"
"if you put anyone under a microscope you're going to see the impurities  all i try to do is the right things for myself and my health  so, i was going to go off and say how wrong i and others think this is but it won't help  all i can say is lord watch over me and whats inevidibly going to happen   "
whats the point anymore?
"thank you everyone for the b-day wishes!! couldn't of asked for a better b-day, went to a steak dinner and a movie with my sweetheart, and got a new jacket! all of it was exactly what i wanted! one more year till the big three-zero    "
everything we do in this life we must pay for  nothing is free besides the grace of god 
"so, i've been fixing up laptops lately for some extra cash and i have two eally nice ones for sale right now  so, if you want a really nice laptop and don't want to spend the $800 brand new, drop me a line and i'll give you the details!! also, let your friends know if they need one as well  thanks everyone "
"ok our nations anthem and other songs were written as they were for a reason, because the content and original arrangements were both powerful enough as is  i can't stand it when singers change it!!!"
i miss being able to count on something  its been awhile   
"so, i was just thinking about some stuff and isn't it a <propmale> labor law that if you work over 40 hours a week you have to be payed overtime??"
"so, i'm meeting with reps from rochester college next tuesday! i can't wait   "
blah    
"so, i started doing the p90x workout and holy crap its hard!!!! i've done 2 workouts and am sore as hell  my legs are so bad that it hurts to do anything!"
"\sooner or later gods gonna cut you down \"""""
"so, anytime <propfemale> decides we are even that would  be great"
