the truth is   sometimes   things just don't work out   and there isn't a tangible reason why and there is no one to blame more than anyone   you want to find the root of the problem so you can conceive an appropriate solution but it seems that the problem existed before memory began   there just isn't an answer  take action before it's too late; let it go

"it's easy to say that you'll give it all up for god, but it's difficult to do! especially when it seems like there's always something new to give up   but giving it up for god doesn't always mean changing your desires  it means moving forward in spite of the desires that impede you  my goal is to push myself higher regardless of how i feel! the change will come one way or another   #focus"

don't ask for honesty if you don't want to deal with hurt feelings  don't ask for space if you don't want to left alone  don't ask questions if you don't want to be questioned    don't ever think that it's too late to apologize for asking for something you didn't want! lessons learned!

selflessness is essential to effective prayer  i believe god will do what's best for you!
starting to feel drained    and that means i've done all i can! it's time for me to stand still and wait on god  smile 
funny how something simple can mean just as much as an e playful ensive gift or an extravagant meal    it really is the thought that counts!
<propfemale>!!!! god is so awesome!
"i have always known that i am not always right    and now i know that i am not always at fault  lord, just continue to reveal my strengths and weaknesses #nomatterwhat  smile "

i wish i could work for a rock camp all year! it's going to be weird going back to my normal job   
looking at how someone handles a situation and how i handle the same thing    building your character will change your life! don't be afraid to examine yourself!
"so many people would rather talk about a person than talk to a person  that means you don't want to know the truth, you want to convince someone that you're right! well, don't try to talk to me about people; i'm already convinced that there's good in everyone  smile "
"i don't need reciprocation  if i faithfully pour out love, god will faithfully restore me  i love all, but i only need one! ?"
"i still believe god will bless my friend! he will be successful, will walk in his anointing and will have peace in every area of his life!"

"had a great time at the girls rock nc showcase with elayna madden, <propfemale> <propfemale>, <propfemale> strom and <propfemale> shaw   will post videos from rehearsal soon   smile "
"when you don't know how to start, saying what you <propfemale> usually helps "
*?*  laugh  !!!
"don't get so worked up over the action that you fail to recognize the intention  the argument isn't about being right! you see, some truths can only be uncovered though conflict  just dismantle the feelings a bit before you speak "
changing your relationship status isn't as simple as facebook makes it out to be 
sometimes people really don't know how they make you feel  don't be too hard on them  smile 
i don't understand why i'm so hungry all the time   
you know    hmph  i just can't share my status with facebook this time!
"lord, i know are able to breath life into every dead, dry bone i see  and if you don't, you will avert my eyes and direct my path straight  into my new blessings!"
"if he is not pursuing you, don't act like god sent him to be pursued by you  you look foolish "
"do i forgive you? yes, of course! do i still want you in my life? hmmm let's pray about that one  smile "
people make mistakes   you are a person right? so don't act so surprised when someone messes up   
"crazy how the devil uses people close to you and they don't even know it    that's why you can't react to everything you feel! it's not easy, but sometimes you have to make yourself run away  smile "

i don't think i'll ever fit in anywhere until i get to heaven 
time to have a conversation with my creator  i need him to tell me about myself!

greater is he that is in me than he that is in the window!!! #nolimits @thetemplevt
"when you learn what someone really thinks of you and you also learn that you really don't care, you don't get violent or defensive  #maturity"
be nice to people  as much as you can and as often as possible 
"some things just don't change, and that's fine! you can always change your perspective  smile "
the devil is such a loser!!!
i'm really very happy about this   smile 
"a lost friend, a ruined relationship, a broken family    severed bonds give the worst type of pain and leave the ugliest scars  yet god is able to keep you in a perfect peace that far surpasses your limited understanding  and he will bless you simply for having faith in his sovereignty  thank-you lord, for my newer and better  smile "
"both actions and words are important and it doesn't really matter if one speaks louder than the other  if the two don't line up for someone, that person simply cannot be trusted "
the heart wants what the heart wants    that's why it's so important to be led exclusively by the holy spirit  my heart really wants it now! but i will be patient and take it when god places it in front of me me  smile 
"aaaaawww, now that is just pure *{?}* god is really drawing me to a peculiar people these days  i love it!!  smile "
"in order to be a doer of the word, you must be transformed into a good soil  a soil suitable for the planted seed to take root, to grow and to be fruitful  ask god for growth and he will reveal your filth  he will try you to clean you up so that the growth of his spirit won't be choked by your thorns  and after that     smile "
"god, you really didn't have to show out this hard, but i'm glad that you did! #favor"
i like where god is taking me  smile 
looking forward to my next trial  why? that's where my next victory is! #favor
"two years ago, if i had seen me as i am now, i would've said: dang! i wish i could be like her! praise god for growth!"
"of course someone will think you're wonderful if all you've shown is how kind and good and generous and caring you can be  and that's nice, it really is  but the people who think you're wonderful even though they know how ugly and nasty and hurtful you can be    hold on to them  you'll find few who are so faithful   ?"
i'm so glad that god remembers my prayers better than i do ?
dear corporate headquarters: please pay your employees more and tell them to be nicer to me   
i'm ready to move! i mean that in so many different ways  smile 
my mind can't keep up with how fast god is moving!
"i hate it when i really want to be there for someone even though i know there's no point in trying to approach him because he    oh well, there's always prayer! god can do more than i can  smile "
"lord, is it me? if it's me i need to know!"
"seems like there are <propmale> changes everywhere in my life  god, you know i wasn't trying to go there or there or there quite yet    but i trust you to keep my mind, my heart and my flesh strictly under the influence of the holy spirit  i know you will prepare, protect and propel me, so i am ready for any and every thing  psalm 139 #giantsteps"
this is good   smile 
s o to <propfemale> mclaughlin and <propfemale> keevy and all my other fv friends who helped me fly through the english countryside lol  smile

"what is a \deep\"" saint? am i supposed to be shallow???"""
yesterday was great! today was great! the rest of my week will be great! #blessed
it's really weird that i haven't gone outside yet     but i've gotten so much done!!!  smile 
"i see that god simply wanted me to know how to tell if i'm attracted to a person or to the anointing  i've gained volumes of wisdom from these last few encounters    it's awesome how much you are able to learn and absorb when you let go, stand still and watch god move! <propfemale> yields wonderful rewards  smile "
so i guess beck has some kind of magnet that attracts amazing female bassists  that's pretty cool 
"life is simpler when you don't spend too much time trying to e playful lain people  if you are patient, they will eventually e playful lain themselves   smile "
"    well, god is still god   smile "
be careful of how you treat people  don't let your attitude and behavior become clouds that hide the light in you!
"do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership  meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all  take heed to yourself and to the doctrine  continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you  1 <propfirst> 4:14-16"
i really wish i could find someone to adopt this stray cat  he's so sweet  sad 
"this is going to be a very long week, but i will make it enjoyable!"
"many things aren't how i want them to be, but i'm excited by the fact that all things are how god wants them to be "
"i'm not going to think about it anymore   if it's meant to happen, god will make it so   smile "
people sure do post some good statuses when they are going through! lol
"currently letting <propfemale> have it's perfect work  oh, but when this wait is over   "
i hate it when i want to change my status but i can't because the things that are on my mind are things that i don't need anyone else to know lol
shift your focus to god so you can watch him shift your situation 
too little too late and too much too soon 
i see you god! just keep moving for me  smile 
"ladies, if he doesn't treat his friends well, he won't treat you well  and if he does treat you well, it won't last long  don't fall for it!"
my weekend without a phone    thinking about the few people i really wanted to contact  the few people who are  really important 
don't rush  don't think too far ahead  don't get over excited  don't faint  don't become anxious  don't change in advance  don't force things  don't stop praying  god is in control 
"i am convinced that god will do it! if you think i'm crazy, keep it to yourself  i don't want your doubt in my atmosphere!"
gotta let god take over     because i can't deal!
"i thank god for my past being in the past  i pray that i will be strong enough and wise enough to leave it, those and them behind me "
"devil, the more you attack my emotions, the more i seek god  i know he will keep me in perfect peace if i just focus a little harder   "
"it can be painful to realize that you won't get what you want  but be comforted by the fact that god knows what you need  trust him with all you have, all you are and all you <propfemale>  he will make everything better  smile "
