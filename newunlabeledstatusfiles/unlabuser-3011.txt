the important thing                  is this: to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are;                 for what we could become 
"the                            difference between a successful person and others is                            not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but                            rather a lack in will                            ~vince lombardi"
"i                            cannot give you the formula for success, but i can give                            you the formula for failure--which is:                           try to please everybody                            ~herbert bayard swope"
the                            surest way not to fail is to determine to succeed ~                           <propfirst> brinsley <propfemale>
