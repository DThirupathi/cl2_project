looking for that right guy seems to be hard these days  you seem to have thought you found mister right and it turns out to be oh boy wrong 
so bored and so tired of games people play only wish people would grow the fuck up and worry about themselves  maybe if they did that then there would be less drama in everyones life
so glad that all 6 kids r behaving  just hope it last the rest of the day
wishing i had someone to cuddle up to on the couch and watch a good movie with
happy father's day to all the men out there!!! and to the women that are the mother and father to there kids  its hard but we still get it done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everythings looks as if everythings looking up for me   i found me a great guy that treats me and my kids with respect and all the love in the world and then finding out i got the job ive been waitting for    this weeks been wonderful  hope it continues this way!!!!!!!!!!!
y do men act like little kids when together why not grow up?
thinkin of changing somethings in my life and who is in them
5 in the morning and wide a wake on a sunday
