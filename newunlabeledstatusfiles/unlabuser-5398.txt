"first clinic, now laundry! does it ever stop?"
i need a haircut and <propfirst> thinks i'd look good with a buzz cut  i'm not 100% sold on the idea yet 
go yanks! gotta love those walk-off home runs!
clinic today! and then    laundry!!! woo wooo!!
<propmale>? dumbledore? would wrist straps for your stupid wands not be helpful like all the freakin' time???
i am so cpr certified right now that it's scary!
going to trim my nails down to the middle phalanx 
"clinic this afternoon then, yup, laundry! ! !"
"the raindrops are only medium sized, but there are a whole lot of them!!!"
"i'm all booked up this weekend  i've got two sessions available next weekend and three next weekend  call the clinic at 732-282-1220, tell them you're a friend of mine and ask to make an appointment  you can't beat $25 for a one hour massage "
   and i fell asleep in the 14th!
go yanks! ! !
h-mat and j-pos! back to back! ! !  go yanks!

"lower leg is still a pain, but i'm going to bed anyway   playful  i'm not crazy worried cuz i don't think i could mess up bad enough in the next week to put my graduation in doubt!"
lower leg is so confusing!
working the lower leg by compartment seems to make a little more sense
