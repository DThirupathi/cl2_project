"if i could have just one wish,\i would wish to wake up everyday\to the sound of your breath on my neck,\the warmth of your lips on my cheek,\the touch of your fingers on my skin,\and the feel of your heart beating with mine   \knowing that i could never find that feeling\with anyone other than you "

"my thoughts for the night, im alive but not beathing  i have fallen but not broken my life is a fairytale there is always a twist  be happy stand strong or die trying   everyone is worth fighting for even if you already have them  smile   show them you care or someone will show them they do more  love always janky  smile "
if i fall will you pick me up?
"my thoughts for the night:i don't pretend to know what love means,but i can tell you what it means for me love is knowing all about someone,and still wanting to be with them more than any other person,love is trusting them enough to tell them everything about yourself,including the things you might be ashamed of,love is feeling comfortable & safe with someone,but still getting weak knees when they walk into a room "
the love of god is the same as the fear of god
loved isn't a word  there is no past tense of love so if you really love someone you'll always love them no matter what 
"i dont care what car you drive or where u live  if you know someone who knows someone  if your clothes are this years cutting edge  if u are an aorb list  i only care about the words that come from your mind  they are all that matters  i will not fall inlove with your bones or skin,i will not fall with anything but the words that truely come from your mind "
just gonna stand there and watch me burn thats alright because i like the way hurts just gonna stand there and here me cry well thats alright because i love the way you lie   you ever love somebody so much u can barely breath when your wit em you meet and niether one of you knew what hit em   
who are we to question what is what
done!
