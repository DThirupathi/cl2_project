"back to werk today, decent weather & i'm sort of better so no other option   i'd rather stay home to keep packing and coughing but one must do what one must do "
"lungs sore from coughing today, and the coughing doesn't look to stop anytime soon   prob staying home from werk again today to keep packing, they're saying rain anyway   "
"cough and pack and cough and pack and cough and pack     looks like rain again, which is good, i'd much rather pack than paint the terribly underbid job we've been assigned (it's only like 75% short of what an identical job went for earlier this year!) "

"political lessons learned today from my father: 1) <propfirst> beck is right, what subject were we discussing again? 2) greek financial collapse can be directly linked back to democrats in congress in the 90's, & 3) dept of education getting 1 9% of the federal budget is unreasonabe, that should be added to the 16 85% of the budget the dept of defense gets   silly me for thinking anything else "

"phwew!  finally back from castle rock, back to civilization and the marvels of the modern <propfemale> (ie - cell reception and the internet!)   the northern bay resort was wonderful, poolside margaritas and lounging cruises on the lake   and i was shocked to find that english was hardly the most common language, heard some russian, some (i believe) czech, some spanish and a few others; i feel so international!"
"so, leaking pipes above my storage unit caused <propmale> water damage to all my books and cd's (i guess the cd's themselves are fine but all the booklets are done)   mold and mildew growing through books, huge spores an inch thick   wow, fun way to spend the morning "

"so i preordered the tron soundtrack in october, because i love both tron and daft punk   it was shipped to me via ups while i was at the entombment of my grandparents and was thus unavailable to sign   what's the reasonable and logical next step taken?  why return it to the sender, of course!  a random third party shipping company in indiana that doesn't even have an email address to write to, you say?  perfect!"

"just two quick parent comments then i've got real stuff to do today   1) i know parents at times contradict each other, but at this point i think it would be easier if mom just said \black\"" to me and dad \""white\"" instead of e playful laining their points of view to me again """
2) offering advice to some is akin to teaching a russian bear physics: getting the bear in the classroom and teaching it english are easy in comparison with the task of e playful laining why it's important that the bear understand the laws of the universe

"up early to practice giving people the championship belt   should i go with the subtle <propmale>'s mini-belt, or perhaps the more overt raji gut-buster belt?  so many choices   "
"i'm so excited about the 4+ inches of snow they said were coming yesterday; it was supposed to start at 3, so i hid under the covers at 2:45; about to go look out the window, i'm sure there's no <propmale> the weather forecasters were exaggerating, no way they would make up a story about a snow emergency, i'm sure there's at least an inch out there   "
"here is why we won't get more than 4 inches of snow: buffalo gets lots of snow for the same reason toledo gets a fraction of buffalo's total, lake effect   now, lake effect works because of the jet stream, which blows west to east due to the rotation of the earth (coriolis effect)   in order for us to get 15+ inches overnight we will need lake effect, which is unlikely, unless the rotation of the earth reverses "
"oh, also, i do completely understand that by disbelieving snowpocamageddon that only means it'll happen   so here's to, what, 30 inches, i think that's the high estimate   woo-hoo!"
"oh my god, they're playing daft punk on the radio, right now, in milwaukee, for real, on kiss fm of all stations   wow!  i can be buried in my home under a record of snow now   wow "

"my dad is pretty sick, been in bed all week with a high fever   i thought he was doing better, until yesterday, when he told me not to go to <propfemale> for fear of my being hurt by rioters   national guard   hm   i think that he's so sick he thinks either a) i'm still in egypt; b) it's 1970 and he has reasonable fear of the national guard; or c) he's completely paranoid delusional   tough final call, really "
"woke this morning to find my xbox in a puddle of water   thankyou, cat, for dumping that vase not on the carpet, not on the table, not on the stack of old magazines, and not on the chair, but on the only electronic device within 10 feet   that's cool, i've owned it for almost 4 months, i was getting sick of it anyway "
