took time to force my brain to slow down  am feeling much better about life  found a great statement 2day: god does not demand of me that i accomplish great things  he does demand of me that i strive for excellence in my relationships 
"? of the day: do i tell god what i feel, or do i tell him what i think he wants to hear?"
"point 2 ponder: when u lv the lord, u lv him with a unique voice- a voice that is different in soul than any other voice that god hears in all of creation "
yesterdays' thought    where have my thoughts been focused lately? when was the last time i asked god to give me the strength to move forward in his power even though i was feeling weak?
"point to ponder: to love god with your mind, you must put god's word into your mind "
today's point to ponder:   no one is outside the bounds of my love   ? to consider:   who is the person in my life i need to take the risk to love  verse:  love your neighbor as yourself
"had a fabulous weekend singing, dancing, and catching up with good friends   we had some of the meatiest teaching ever!!!! still missed my favorite friend  kisses"
pics  when you've had 4 glasses of champain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i'll try 2morrow!!!!!

i'll have 2 comment 2morrow!!!!!! nite all
"consistant love can only be e playful ressed one opportunity at a time ( 1 jn 4:11) dear friends, since god loved us that much, we surely ought to love each other  how can i show love to the person right in front of me- today?"
it's always a risk to love  an even deeper hurt is  not to love 
"jesus doesn't want us to try our hardest; he wants us to learn to trust him    a new commandment i give you: love one another, as i have loved you, so you must love one another "
"how can i trust jesus for the impossible in a relationship? when jesus becomes the standard, it is immediately obvious that we need a new relationship and power in our lives "
"had a productive day: 1 ) cooked rabbit skin glue & applied to stretched canvas, 2 ) wiped <propmale>l window sills in studio, 3 ) vacuumed house, 4 ) vacuumed studio, 5 ) scrubbed <propmale>l floors in house, 6 ) wiped off <propmale>l easels, 7 ) scrubbed <propmale>l tables and cleaned <propmale>l painting p<propmale>lets, 8 ) cleaned out <propmale>l turpentine, 9 ) cleaned <propmale> 3 baths   now for a tea break!!!!!!!  good day"
"if you've stopped feeling love, the first step is to begin to act with love again  (gal  6:9) let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up  (? 2 consider) is there someone i don't feel like loving, whom i need to love?"
"getting ready and revved up to do an all day yard clean up, & clorox everything imaginable "
chatting with one of my english friends having great fun!!!
"point 2 ponder: god will never command you to do something, he will not give you the power to do  verse: 1jn 4:18- there is no fear in love  but perfect love drives off fear, because fear has to do w  punishment  the one who fears is not made perfect in love "
? 2 ponder: how can i take a love that's old & allow god to make it new?
"i did get the dirt from 3 house in the draining ditches cleaned out yesterday, the front yard cleaned, the side, & all the leaves in back & back ditch cleaned up yesterday  glad that's over!!!!!!!  2day- wash all the mold off the driveway, sidewalk, & back of house "
"day 11 of my 40 day word fast: point 2 ponder: jesus tok his own emotions seriously, & so he e playful ressed those emotions openly & then chose to act lovingly  verse: jesus wept(jn  11 smile 5)  ? 2 consider: is ther a feeling in my life that i haven't dealt with"
"kindness is on my mind  kindness is e playful ressed in doing the little things- & the little things add up to a great relationship  kindness is practical: washing dishes, taking out the garbage, vacuuming, even when it's not ur turn "
"kindness is taking all our hopes & dreams for our children's success & change their diapers & stay up all nite long when they ar sick  kindness is taking our plans 2 \change the world\"" into serving hungry people in a soup kitchen or visiting the sick in a quite hospital room """
"yes, this is on my mind   i hope we all remember; it's really not about us, so much as it is about loving one another in the small, unnoticed ways in the daily boring thing that all add up to being    \ kind \""!"""

"romans 8:5 for those who are according to the flesh and are controlled by it's unholy desires set their minds & purpose those things which gratify the flesh, but those who are according to the spirit & are controlled by the desires of the spirit set their minds on & seek those things which gratify the holy spirit"
"romans 8:6 now the mind of the flesh [which is sense & reason without the holy spirit] is  death   [ death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin, both here & hereafter]  but the mind of the holy spirit is life & soul peace         [ both now & forevermore] "
still waiting for clear bags to fed x in so i can pkg everything   madness!!!!! uggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"romans 8 smile 3  who shall bring any charge against god's elect[when it is] god who justifies [ that is who puts us in right relation to himself? who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom god has chosen? will god, who acquits?]"
"romans 8 smile 4 who is there to condemn [us]? will christ jesus ( the messiah), who died, or rather who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of god actually pleading as he intercedes for us?"
finally all ready to sing tonight-all  night 
yes! we had a lot of people this year from england  my friend from italy was also here w  her english husband of 7 mos   (sweet)  excellent conference!! thanks 4 asking
"rms  9:11 and the children were yet unborn & had yet so far done nothing neither good nor evil  even so, in order to <propfemale> out god's purpose of selection(election, choice), which depends not on works or what men can do but on him who calls them "
"roms  9:14 what shall we conclude then? is there injustice upon god's part? certainly not! 9:15  for he says to <propmale>, i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy & i will have compassion(pity) on whom i will have compassion "
"roms  9:16  so then[god's gift] is not a ? of human will & human effort, but of god's mercy  [ it depends not on one's own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race, but on god's having mercy on him] "
so in conclusion: maybe we should take time out of these extremely short lives & cry out for mercy!!!!!
thought it was saturday?????? call me
"rms  10:20 then <propmale> is so bold as to say, i have been found by those who did not seek me: i have shown (revealed) myself to those who did not [consciously] ask for me "
let us start praying for god to reveal himself to all those we love and that we want to spend eternity with 
entertaining friends from italy & london  i'm pretty tired! not had my tea on time 4 7 days straight!! ugggggggghhhh!
"roms  13:14 but clothe yourself with the lord jesus christ ( the messiah ), and make no provision for [ indulging ] the flesh [ put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature ] to [ gratify its ] desires( lusts ) "
i'v been in the book of romans now for awhile and have never gotten sooooo much out of it as recently  i'm seeing new perspectives every day 
having a blast with my friends from italy & london
"roms  14:7 none of us lives to himself [ but to the lord ], and none of us dies to himself [ but to the lord for ] 14:8 if we live, we live to the lord, and if we die, we die to the lord  so then, whether we live or we die, we belong to the lord  14:9 for christ died and lived again for this very purpose, that he might be lord both of the dead and of the living "
"i am learning to endure much more than i thought possible and enjoying the complete process!!!!! i'm learning, also how much i really do love god & how pleasant it is to walk in obedience "
"roms  15:1,2,3&13 we who are strong [in our convictions& our robust faith] ought to bear w  failings, frailties and the tender scruples of the weak; [we ought to help <propfemale> the doubts & qualms of others] & not to please ourselves "
"let each one of us make it a practice to please (make happy) his neighbor for his good & for his true welfare, to edify him [to strengthen him & build him up spiritually] "
"for christ did not please himself [ gave no thought to his own interests];but, as it is written, the reproaches & abuses of those who reproached & abused fell on him "
may the god of our hope so fill you with all joy & peace in believing [ through the e playful erience of your faith] that by the power of the holy spirit you may abound& be overflowing (bubbling over) with hope 
"just went through <propfirst> rocks photos of herbie; i can hardly see for crying so hard  i am sooooo sorry for the lose of one man who really, and truly loved his family  i wish he had not been sick for so, so, so long  heaven will be richer for gaining him and he'll finally get to see everything clearly "
"just said good-bye to last student, cooked 4 my friend who was picking up my other friends whom i cooked salmon 4 and drove them around 4 a few days enjoying their company  now they are on their way to new orleans to fly to boston  now to make my bed after washing laundry, dusting, cleaning all 3 bathrooms, & all the floors & carpets "

"1 corin  1:9 god is faithful(reliable, trustworthy, and therefore ever true to his promise, & he can be depended on); by him you were called into companionship & participation w  his son, jesus christ our lord   1:10  but i urge & entreat you, brethren, by the name of our lord jesus christ, that all of you be in perfect <propfemale> & full agreement in what you say,"
"and that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding & in your opinions & judgments "
"1 corin  1:18  for the story & message of the cross is sheer absurdity & folly to those who are perishing & on their way to perdition,  but to us who are being saved it is the [ manifestation of ] the power of god "
"1 corin  1:28 and god also selected ( deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame, & what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame   1:29  so that no mortal man should [have pretense for glorying and] boast in the presence of god "

"1corin  13:12    for now we are looking into a mirror that gives only a dim (blurred) reflection [of reality as in a riddle or enigma], but then [when perfection comes] (jesus) we shall see in reality & face  to face  now i know in part (imperfectly), but then i shall know & understand fully & clearly, even in the same manner as i have been known & understood [ by god]   god help us all!!"
"happy birhday to one of the best daughter-in-laws ever, <propfirst> gray!!!! lv ya"

"o death where is ur victory? o death, where is ur sting?"
"15:51 take notice! i tell u a mystery ( a secret truth, an event decreed by god)  we shall not all fall asleep [in death], but we shall all be changed (transformed)"
"!corinthians 15: 50   but i tell u this, brethren, flesh & blood cannot [become partakers of eternal salvation &] inherit or share in the kingdom of god; nor does the perishable  (that which is decaying) inherit or share in the imperishable ( the immortal) "

"3:15,16 yes, down 2 this [very] day whenever <propmale> is read, a veil lies upon their minds & hearts  but whenever a person turns [ in repentance ] 2 the lord, the veil is stripped off & taken away "
"2 corin  3:14 in fact, their minds were grown hard & calloused [ they had become dull & had lost the power of understanding ]; 4 until this present day, when the old testament is being read, that same veil still lies [ on their hearts ], not being lifted that in christ it is made void & done away with "
"2 corint 5:20 so we are christ's ambassadors, god making his appeal as it were through us  we [as christ's personal representatives]  beg you for his sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] and be reconciled to god "

"2 corinthians 7:1  therefore, since these [great] promises are ours, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates & defiles body & spirit, & bring our consecration to completeness in the [reverential] fear of god "
"2 corinthians 7:10 for godly grief & the pain god is permitted to direct, produces a repentance that leads & contributes to salvation & deliverance from evil, & it never bring regret; but worldly grief ( the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world ) is deadly [ bringing & ending in death ]"
"2 corinthians 7:4 i have great boldness & free & fearless confidence & cheerful courage toward you, my pride in you is great  i am filled [brimful] with the comfort [of it]; with all our tribulation & in spite of it, [i am filled with comfort] i am overflowing with joy "
