my aunt left!!! and she took the baby!!! they moved out!!! now there is only 13 people living in my house!!!
tired and wish i could just go to sleep    i love your evil mind   
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wishis that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but acceptance and equal rights    93% won't copy and paste this  will you make your       status for at least one hour?             ? promote (there be more) love & acceptance! not hate
finally!!! i got a job!!! this means that i can move out by march    go me!!!
it would only happen to me    go to the hills    <propfemale> out and talk    listen to music    then the car turns off    what the hell!!! in the middle of nowhere with cows and we need to jump start the car    wonderful   
"things <propfemale> cobarubio says    \its hard being your friend when you make sounds like that \"""""
elrik bit my dog    what the hell!!! that is not normal on any level   
rue kicked <propfirst> in the balls    epic    laugh out loud really loud!!!
crazy stupid night    can't believe that happened    thank you    you two know who you are    glad it happened with you guys   
i was supposed to do something today    but i forgot   
"why me??? first we get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a dead car, then a car crash, and now the car was on fire    what the hell!!!"
<propfemale> cobarubio is straightening my hair    she burned herself twice already    wow    i love you   
i is tired    i hate shopping    thankfully someone was there to make it awesome   
what's a cute zombie name???

<propfemale> cobarubio made my zombie cry!!! what the hell    i have never seen my zombie do that before    what a meanie

"elrik gallardo: i rather do math than a girl   \me: ???\elrik: i mean i rather try to understand math than a girl   \both:  ha ha!!!"
bored at home    hate having nothing to do   
"pretty chill day    <propmale> out with old friends, new friends, and people i just met    good day   "
damn you <propfirst>!!! just call me <propfemale>   
<propfirst> is horrible at comforting me    so much for being my favorite brother   
damn you turtle!!! you're still the only one that makes me feel better   
talk about an awesome night    i'm actually smiling    its a real smile!!! really happy   
i hate being strong!!! it sucks!!!
<propfemale> cobarubio was walking me to the bus stop      then she crashed into a fence    if this is her walking i don't want to see her driving    i love you   
going to disappear for a little bit    i'll be back soon    once i feel better again    sorry <propfemale>    i know i said i wouldn't disappear anymore    but i kind of need to right now   
being impulsive    not one of my better traits   
another boring saturday at home    blah   
"me: can i have my movie back???\<propfirst> (brother): if only things were that simple my dear   \me: just give me my movie   "
okay    so my cell phone is out of service    sad face    i will fix this    once i figure out how to get money   
i fixed it    my phone is back    yay!!!
back from san <propfirst>    had a great time    thank you to the friends that made it fun   
what do i name my future pet rooster???
protect me from what i want   
the empty promises of a parent    stop saying that you are going to leave me alone if you're not going to leave me alone   
"i hug brother    he pets my head and says, \i've learned to accept and not judge   \"" what the hell is that supposed mean?!?!?!"""
mission save juanito: epic fail!!!
i won't regret what i'm doing    i'm doing it for a reason    if what i'm doing shocks you then you apparently never knew me in the first place    this is me   
i hate this feeling    why does it keep coming back???
sister leaves tomorrow    she comes back sunday    this is so bittersweet   
"me: mom i'm hungry   \mom: what are you hungry for???\me: tacos!!!\mom: okay   \walks away then comes to my room   \mom: here's a sandwich   "
why must <propfirst> always kill my fun??? and then stab me in the eye???
every time my phone vibrates i get excited because i think its her   
i hugged my dad for the first time in like 3 weeks    i missed his hugs     sad 
why does everyone think something is wrong??? i'm fine   
there's a baptism tomorrow    at my house    what the hell    why doesn't anyone tell me earlier???
can't i ever be happy??? either way    no matter what i pick i will lose   
at the current moment there is 22 kids at my house    wow   
home sucks   
and now my past comes back   
one day it will all make sense    but for now i'll just sit here confused    thank you <propfemale>    and <propfirst>   
okay the day came a lot sooner than e playful ected   
<propfemale> cobarubio drove us and we didn't die!!!
i hate that they know me just as well as i know me    grrr   
crap    i just cut my own hair    i'm not entirely sure why though    it sounded like a good idea at the time   
<propfemale> cobarubio is taking a shower and i'm bored in her room    blah   
yes  i'm just like <propmale>!!!
i don't know why i do these things   
and there is now a little robot on my side    every time i get a tattoo or a piercing i get really sleepy   
help me out here peeps    give me some good songs to download    go!!!
and once again it has been proven    blood is not thicker than water   
i hate the freaking healing process of a tattoo!!! it sucks more that the actual pain of getting it   
mean little dove!!!
chains and whips excite me lol
