"my status picture was taken 60 years ago today, on my first birthday   i always think of my birthday in conjunction with my mom tink's birthday   hers was january 17   she always reminded me that i had been a late christmas present but an early birthday present for her  she was the best \thanks to all of you who think of me today and wish me the best   it means a lot to me "
"finish each day and be done with it   you have done what you could   some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can \tomorrow is a new day   you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense \<propmale>"
