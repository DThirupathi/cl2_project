definition of skateboarding is it's something that free's your mind from all worries it gives you hope and dreams and goals  it's about the laughter and fun of just chillin with your friends and running from cops and sometimes causeing havic  (hey if you bail don't let that stop you from doing something  you get back up and you just keep going for it  cause ill never give up in skateboarding till my legs fall off )
skateboarder: a person who chose a cool sport instead of putting on a jockstrap and jumping all over men 
"thought that due date was a funny movie  they definetly tried too hard to make it a funny movie, and it was no hangover  <propmale> (played by zach galifinakis) is almost a exact copy of the hangover's <propfirst>  despite those reasons, <propfirst> downey jr  and zach galifinakis were an excellent match that had you laugh for a majority of the move "
