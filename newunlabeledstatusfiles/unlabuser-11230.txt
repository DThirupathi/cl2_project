thinks summer vacation is waaaay too long!!
"thinks it's such a blast to haul all three kids to the allergy and asthma center for their four month check up   what fun watching the chaos unfold, lol "
"i should probably not be drinking coffee at 11 smile 0 at night   but it's there, i'm here, and it's calling, lol   besides that -it's coffee   'nuf said "
trying to keep the house clean when the kids are home for the summer is like pissing in the wind 
happy father's day!!
"people who say things like 'the hotter the better' in reference to the weather usually have a place to go to escape the heat   but when your thermostat reads 92 even with the ac on, then summer really, really sucks   i can't imagine anyone liking that!"
what's your favorite mj song?  hard choice   thriller is one of my faves - i had the album and i listened to it so much i wore it out   it's so weird that he's gone   
it's our 13th anniversary!!
the beginning is always the best place to start 
"if you get bored, try this - make sure the lid is not latched on your brand new 32 oz  of vanilla coffee creamer and shake vigorously   you'll be surprised how far it can fly across the room and how much surface area of your body, clothes, counters, refri"
tragedy (tra je <propfirst>) noun - when you're pmsing and lose your favorite homemade brownie recipe 
thank you for the birthday wishes!!   laugh 
i was going to write something intelligent   but i got nothin' 
"quoted conversation while driving two days ago  \\cameron:  do you remember that time when the hubcap fell off?\me:  yes, i do   do you remember that?\cameron:  no"
had a fun day of lounging on the couch with hubby watching movies and eating <propfirst>'s yummy homemade salsa 
"another day, another meltdown "
"\you're a corpse   your opinion doesn't count anymore \""\",e5c881a18479789ff2d02dffd915231d,"more couch, more movies, but this time with chinese food - oh yeah  wink "
\look at him," crop dusting across your open house \""\"e5c881a18479789ff2d02dffd915231d,"it's asthma season at our house again   one is already on the nebulizer, the other two are threatening to follow "
"is going to spend the day sprawled out in <propfemale>'s bed, sipping coffeegasms, and catching some big love "
\whereas when you open your mouth," you come across more as sullen and hostile \""\"e5c881a18479789ff2d02dffd915231d,"heard from my shawny   smile   i love you, sweetie "
cleaning the house when the kids are home is like pissing into the wind 
is enjoying the quiet tapping of the keyboard in an empty house   it's been months since i wrote anything   and i'm enjoying it!
for some strange reason i'm craving chinese food 
"just finished reading catching fire   there are a lot of things i could say, but i think holy crap will sum it up quite nicely "
wishing i had book 3 so i could just crawl into bed and read 
"thank you, <propfemale> for book 3 a day early!  i'll start it today    laugh "
"my 13 year old, who made french toast for the first time today, already makes it better than i do "
"what do you do when you're locked out of the house?  well, if you're my 13 year old son, you kick the door in!"
has finished the trilogy 
kids are excellent at spreading contagion   sick   again!  cripes 
"sometimes i wonder about my children   my adorable 7 year old had a box and was pretending he was selling chocolate   he proudly displayed the 'chocolate' - which was really just an old video cassette tape in a box   i pretended to pay him, and munched happily on my chocolate   then he informs me the chocolate has e playful losion particles in them   and i'm going to blow up in 5   4   3   2   1!!  oy!  parenthood!"
has a kid home today with a 103 degree temp   and the fall sicknesses start   
"the fever is gone, but now he's throwing up - i'm not sure if he's better or not   and some of the rest of the family is flirting with it, as well   *sigh*"
chinese food + borderlands all day = fun!
we had our first frost last night 
"so i bought stuff to make chili and beef stew, nice hearty meals to enjoy on chilly days, and had hubby take the air conditioners out - and it's hot!  ugh!"
i set this morning aside for writing and i'm too tired to concentrate   my brain is empty and i can't focus   ugh   i hate that   it will be a week before i get another writing morning 
"that's it   i'm done   i'm never making another cake again   my son wanted a character from the warrior cats series that he's reading on his cake   the cat is gray   simple, right?  not when you use a dab of black food coloring mixed with white frosting hoping to get gray   but i didn't get gray, i got lavender   for a 12 year old boy's birthday cake - a freaking purple cat   stupid <propmale> black food coloring!  > sad "
"the difference between my 7 year old and 13 year old   i asked my 13 year old to do something over the weekend that would have been nice   but he seemed to think he should get something for it, and it ended up in an argument   the 7 year old offered to do it, i didn't think he could, but he insisted   and he did it for a big smoochie kiss and hug   sigh    teenagers "
"well the weather is supposed to be lovely today   we have high wind advisories and warnings, and a tornado watch "
"so   it's day 5 of the writer's challenge and i have yet to write a word   i planned to come home today, plop into my chair, and get started - but the jagoffs down the street are blasting their car stereo, and all i hear is 'boom boom boom' vibrating through my wall and into my floor   it's a concentration breaker for sure   sometimes i wonder why i try to write at all - i never seem to have time to do it!!"
children - nature's alarm clock
friday is for zombies
oh joy we have a barfing boy   i hope it's a fluke puke and not a stomach virus that we're all going to catch 
"i woke up this morning unable to breathe   then i realized i had a 14 lb  cat on my chest   he was looking all content cuddling up with me, big orange behemoth that he is "
"i got no sleep because i'm sick, we have no water, and i have a kid home with diarrhea   this sounds like a great way to start the week "
friday we watched '<propfemale> grandin'   this movie is a must see for anyone whose life is touched by autism 
happy thanksgiving
"<propfirst> ate turkey!  and wacky cake!  he's never liked turkey, and he doesn't eat cake   it was so nice for him to sit at a family meal and actually eat something the rest of the family was eating, instead of having a special meal made just for him   and - he liked them both!   laugh "
"it took my hubby a half hour to straighten all the limbs of our artificial tree yesterday - thanks to the cats climbing in it last year   it looked great yesterday, but there's a big empty spot in the middle where all the limbs are pushed down   sigh   it's going to be a long season   i hope the tree lives through it "
"though it's still early, this is the best i've felt in a week   except for the lingering asthma, i'm feeling more like myself   yay!"
i asked my oldest how bad the weather needs to be before he wants me to pick him up at the bus stop instead of letting him walk   his answer:  'uninhabitable biohazard-like conditions' 
"yesterday, my youngest added a dramatic flair to his reading homework   he got a book about space station life, and everytime he said 'in space', it was always in a big way   'in space'   \the information they send back to earth helps us understand more about life   in space \""  by the time he finished the book i was cracking up """
"we survived another 'breakfast with <propfemale>' - which is a little thing the school does every year  free breakfast, a visit with <propfemale>, crafts, and a secret <propfemale> store  i was tempted to complain about how early this all started for a saturday, until my youngest jumped up and down and said that he was 5% excited, and my middle kid was valiant and helpful  i guess that's worth a little less sleep  wink "
"yesterday we had the prettiest picturesque snow   the flakes were light and fell slowly, yet the snow was heavy enough to coat things quickly   it looked like movie snow   and it was the perfect consistency to make snowballs - which the boys did!"
"last night my youngest, who is 7, was reading captain underpants and was laughing hysterically at words he'd never seen before   'amok', 'rigged', and 'fiasco' will probably make an appearance in his vocabulary soon   who knew words could be so funny   smile "
"two hour school delay today   joy upon joy   kinda wrecks the whole day as the younger kids don't start school until 11   then by the time errands are run, it will be time to go and pick them back up "
i'm back at home at chaos central   thanks to <propmale> for dutifully c<propfemale>ing my christmas picture everyday like i asked him to   and many thanks to <propfirst> and friends for being awesome hosts and letting me <propfemale> out with them over the weekend   love you guys 
wishing you all a very <propfemale> christmas
"happy 14th birthday, <propfirst>!"
quote from cameron:  <propfirst> finally reached the age of 14   4 more years and he'll be packing up and leaving 
i am constantly redefining who i am and what's important in my life 
school is canceled today because of icy roads   so glad the entire brood is all home in our <propfemale> house with nowhere to play after a three day weekend 
"now <propmale>'s home, too   he slipped three times on the ice from the front door to the car and twisted his bad knee   painkillers and a heating pad (and iron man 2) for medication "
chinese food and zombie shooting - what a great afternoon!
"i just slipped and fell in the ice snow and twisted my ankle   i think it will be ok, though "
"that sitting all day thing i mentioned yesterday won't be a problem, because i'm sick   <propmale> is sick   and <propmale> has been sick for two days   this week is going down the crapper already "
"4 out of the 5 members of the wood family have begun the transformation   will the youngest member be immune to the infection and resist joining the legion of zombies?  or is he, too, doomed?"
everyone is on the mend and back at work school   this means a whole day to myself    laugh 
do not taunt happy fun ball 
"blizzard warning until 7pm tomorrow night   schools are closed today, and likely tomorrow, as well "
do something spontaneous today 
"why?  why is it that a beautiful, bright <propfemale> day full of promise can turn into one full of shit within mere minutes?"
