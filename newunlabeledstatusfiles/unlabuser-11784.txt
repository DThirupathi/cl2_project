"why texas? why are you so hot?!? i hate it  i actually can't wait to get back to iowa! i did have and still having fun, texas, but you are too hot!"
who can say if i've been changed for the better? but because i knew you i have been changed for good â€¦  well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime so let me say before we partso much of me is made of what i learned from you  you'll be with me like a handprint on my heartand now whatever way our stories end  i know you have re-written mine by being my friend   
"every night in my dreams i see you  i feel you  that is how i know you go on  far across the distance  and spaces between us, you have come to show you go on  near, far, wherever you are i believe that the heart does go on  once more you open the door, and you're here in my heart, and my heart will go on and on  love can touch us one time, and last for a lifetime "
watching 'the count of <propmale> cristo' for the second time today! i love this movie!!!
human life is like a fire  it starts off so big and clams down after a while but then  you add something to it and it is back to its old self  and fires die the same way humans do  you can go peacefully or you can go the other way  same with fire rain can stop a fire short or it can go on a long time  but once the fire is gone it always continues to burn in someone else  'to my mom and grandpa <propmale>'
i don't even know what is on my mind any more  i feel like i am drowning in a ocean and i can't get out of it  maybe it will get easier if i spend sometime on my own    but like that will ever happen  please god i beg you make my life easier or a little bit better  and i will love you more than i already do 
why can't life be like a good movie? everything going the way it is supposed to  everyone happy  but life doesn't work that way  i hope wishing it did makes life easier 
*sigh* sometimes i just wish life could go the way it should    why do things just go the totally stupid way? ugh! some beach!!! *sigh*

volleyball was fun  but i am soooo tired  i don't want to wake up tomorrow and i haven't even fell asleep yet  i hurt already  i really don't want to know how i am going to feel tomorrow 
where is the guy that just knows what to say and when to say it? where is the guy who loves me for me? where is the guy that knows all my wrongs and makes them right? where is the guy that holds me when i am crying and instead of asking for answers he just holds me? where is the guy of my dreams? sometimes i feel there is no guy that is the guy 
feeling down  need someone to talk too  text me if you can be my shoulder to cry on  i hope i get out of this mood soon

my heart jumps just a little when i hear your ringtone on my phone    i let it play out so i can hear the end    but when it stops and i send the message back    i wonder if your heart jumps too    or if it is just me being weird    sometimes i just have to wonder
