happy new year everyone
"captain's log, day 1:  i seem to have logged on here again out of curiousity   many creatures seem to inhabit this space, now to catalog them and determine their status as friend or foe "
wok = more awesome than you can imagine o o
and now i end my night declaring that i am possibly the slowest texter in the world lol
"yeah   i'm so naturally nocturnal it's just not even funny   gotta be up in 4 hrs for work and i'm still going strong, so lame lol "
<---needs to find her camera 
"good day so far  smile   bought random things, ate some thai food, ran around the park throwing some ball, up next is karaoke and alcohol!  all on maybe 2 hrs of sleep lol "
   need   coffee
now for a day of vegging out **munches on a salad**
"home from work now, excited that i'm going to martial arts tonight since it's been so long i know my body's going to have hell to pay   but at the same time i'm kind of depressed, i guess it's b c of the going ons of work, nothing severe, just kind of bleh "
"so after watching the class today i decided that   i need a workout <propmale>!  lol, feeling intimidated atm  smile "
"not sure why i've been such an impulsive jerk lately, maybe i'm just adjusting to the physical stress i've been adding to myself?  hopefully i stop soon"
"still feeling beat up from class, regardless i'm charging back in there tomorrow lol!"
i have a couple of decent ideas for photos   maybe i should actually try to hunt down my phone; kind of tired of looking at my profile pic
"waiting patiently for metrocon   still have about a month, and haven't figured out who i want to dress up as  annoyed     \\any ideas anyone?"
"imo, smartly = weak adjective"
airsoft & martial arts!  fun day ahead  smile 
"oh man, i'm exhausted   it's been a fantastic day though, airsoft went well, then martial arts right after was a little bit of a strain but in a good way, on top of that we just went out to eat at thai pan alley with some friends which is conveniently located right on the beach    smile   now to veg for a bit before crashing "
"there!  i finally threw some photos up   granted they're mostly from a year ago, and i'm not in a single one of them but hey, they're there"
"messed around with the violin a bit, twas fun!   smile "
"so tired, so hungry"
"kind of nervous about the belt ceremony tomorrow today (since it's 1 a m )  i'm pretty sure it'll go fine, but i was warned by my instructor that he likes to have the adult's do performances for the kids and their parents   hope i'm in decent form "
"<---e playful erimenting;  9 lbs worth of weights for about 9 hrs now, just have to wear them for 45 <propfemale> more, and then we'll see how class goes  smile "
"meh, stayed up late again tonight , time to put the needle and thread away and sleep lol"
"is it normal to have you parental figure be your greatest opponent in life?  in my case it'd be my father when it comes to health type things and mother in attitude   i guess it could be the hero type syndrome where you want to be most like, actually surpassing them in those things "
curiousity:  what do y'all think of twitter?
"depth of, in, or from perception?  maybe vice-versa?"
"meh, 2 days into vacation and haven't started working out as planned yet   oh well, at least the car's back in running condition"
"now @ 216, lost 29 and only 26 more to go!"
"wow, this was a really long but fun day  smile   airsoft, then lunch, and on top of that we ended up rushing off to the metrocon b c i had gotten my dates confused and thought it was next week lol   unfortunately, i forgot my camera in the car, so no pics of people dressing up  sad "

"so, in the last 6 months, i've lost 65 lbs, quit smoking after 11-12 years but it still doesn't feel like enough   sometimes being human is annoying   "
some things are just so blatantly obvious that you just have to laugh  smile

"ok, now i'm just upset   changing the zodiac on us like that   just b c of a little gravity over thousands of years ended up shifting things   why couldn't the world just stay flat!"
thai food for lunch was good   that's one good thing so far today 
"i'm such a sucker for shinsengumi samurai shows  smile   especially when the new weapons <propfemale> is part of the conflict   it's depressing, but i have to admire the spirit "
"ninja sigh    i need to get up and run around or something, way too much energy right now for how late at night it is"

my day and i will do better tomorrow
"screaming into a pillow isn't as satisfying as people make it out to be   not that i've done it in a couple of years, i was just thinking that maybe i should, but then remembered that   then thought to post it just as some kind of babble  smile   i hope you enjoyed this session of button pushing fun   ((buttons   keyboard   get it?))"
thought of the moment:  i **need** an oni mask

"so i'm making this table, and it's requiring entering an excessively long equation into a single cell in excel   which wouldn't be too much of a problem since i actually really like excel because you have so much range in it   except i keep losing my place while entering it *grumble*   sad "
"if only there was a place to go swimming   and no, not the ocean  sad "
the phrase i used the most today was: o d  on orange juice;  how about y'all?  playful 
tonight was a really good night  smile 
ended up sleeping in till 9 so i ended up missing class  sad   but i ended up planting some <propfemale> fly traps and we picked up a bearded dragon and a pac man frog  smile 
now if only i could find some pants my renaissance festival costume would be complete  laugh 
finally the internet's back up!  too bad i have to head to work in a couple so i don't really get to enjoy it  sad
