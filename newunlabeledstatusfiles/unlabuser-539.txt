"right, so i'm supposed to be going on the highway today with my driving practice n' shit  chances of me getting in a horrible car crash? let's take your bets!"
"*still confused and wondering why he uses facebook*\\still alive, that's about all going for me at the moment "
"actually, i'm starting to get into fallout 3  i didn't like it the last 2 or 3 times i tried to play it  then i found out the secret this playthrough  say \fuck it all\"" and train into melee stealth  then sneak attack and get insta-crits with a sledgehammer that take people's limbs off \",0b42716ee3a628f73360af65b20e88c7,"getting more used to using facebook \\update on my current issues?: still working through it, doing better though "
"right, so, update time i guess  if i'm going to be using facebook i might as well \beat starcraft 2, can't wait for the e playful ansion  not eager to do quickplay multiplayer matches though \got pretty bored of fallout 3  too many sidequests now, and i can't handle wanting to do them all in a nice and orderly fashion \tired of warcraft for now, really not that interested until the e playful ansion"
"probably going to the movie showing of beauty and the creep 2  sounds like fun, and i could use the entertainment with how bored i am  hope to be there guys "
"problems at home are getting better and worse  i suspect there will be a nosedive coming at some point where everything is going to spiral out of control again, but for now i can deal with it, there doesn't seem to be much bad immediately "
"has anyone seen <propfirst> pilgrim yet? i've got mixed feelings about seeing it  i bought the game and really enjoy it (but i enjoy any c surprise p sort of game, so i guess i'm biased), and it's a movie made by a nerd  it's my kind of movie  i saw the guy's work on youtube and enjoy it, but i've heard the movie got bad reviews and that it's doing really horrid in theaters  suggestions? what have you guys heard?"
"been reading storm of the century too  yes, i know, <propfirst> <propmale>  i didn't feel okay ripping the cthulu book from my brother when he was halfway through  also should get started on reading this rough copy of a story my sister in law gave me  want to really badly, but it's so hard to start a new book, you know?"
"also, job hunt   need to get on that  if anyone 'round bel air has a suggestion or someting, go for it  i was thinking about looking up barnes and <propmale> to see if there was anything i could do there  it sounds simple, quiet, and my kind of work  i don't think they really have anything i could do though, they probably aren't hiring at the moment "
"been getting very panicky lately too  given, it's reasonable to be considering my current problems at the moment, but it's really odd since i don't have much of a reason  i think since school's starting soon i feel like i've wasted my summer in a cocktail of depression and boredom  and i'm still sorta in it, so  hope i get over it soon  could use some friendly faces when i head into school, would probably help out "
"relationship problems? it's tough   but i'm doing just a bit better  i'm not really feeling better  i kind of feel alright for a few days, and then fall back into this depression for awhile  i'm not hurting other people anymore though, not putting all of it on them or bothering them about it, you know? that's good, and that was my goal  so, i'm doing better socially  really wish that would translate to emotionally "
"doing better with the relationship thing  i think i've more or less moved on, it's just all the stress and drama and everything kinda come up to a boiling point and, you know, it's gotta come out somehow \but, i do feel better   for the most part, i'm good and single now, looking though, so if you guys got any friends that are, you know, dorky enough to like me, gimme a call! seeyaaaaa"
"alright, starcraft ii is just awesome  i went through and beat the story campaign on hard, got 100% of the achievements too, and now have the mighty zeratul avatar picture as a reward \\for aiur! (yes, i'm a total dork)"
"alright, i guess i'm updating on facebook more  achievement +10 points  i'm playing a lot of minecraft now that i beat starcraft  i built a huge-ass castle from the ground up, i made this city, i built it on rocks and dirt, and you can't take it from me! *locks door and sits on overlook with a bow*"
"it's tomorrow, guys  thanks anyway though   smile "
3 new slams written 
"thank you all, needed that today   smile "
"alright, so help me out here guys  i'm building up a stockpile of slams so when i -do- have a period of no writing, i can still go and participate in the slam  i've currently got 3 written (2 of them edited and re-drafted) slams annoyed -nerd overload\-in another castle\-random thoughts\\i need more ideas for slams! anything will do, trust me, i have no shame "
"also, if any of you think it would be a good idea and you'd want to watch me do something else at the next slam, say so  i've thought about singing, doing a dramatic reading, or just going up and having a conversation with the audience  oh yeah, that sounds like evil don't it? anything you'd like to see, and suggestions for what to read sing, etc "
"once again, thank you all for making yesterday a better day than it started out to be   smile \\on another note: our knight was the villain at medival times  mwahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa"
"i feel quite horrible for my parents right now  they bought me this brand new collector's edition mmo, final fantasy 14  it came with all these special offers, this beautiful artwork and journal, and i can play it before it even releases  the game itself is gorgeous too \\but i'm bored out of my mind by it   i don't really like it   "
"hahahahahahahahaaaaaaa, nobody is faster than me at typing maniac! success!"
"right, so update time annoyed i'm getting terribly bored of life  wrote another slam: that brings us up to 4 slams  also think i've chosen a song to open mic one of these slams  not really playing anything interesting either  family problems are still problematic but *slowly* resolving  getting over the breakup is also progressing, think my poem at the slam will help  girlfriend i still be lacking "
"i've been feeling very type-y thanks to this typing maniac game  i just wish i had something to type up, you know? i also wish i had more slams to write, but i'm starting to run a bit dry of the well "
"well, today is starting out pretty badly, actually   having a small anxiety attack and panicking, just feeling very bleh  i see my doctor in a few days, i'm hoping i can get panic pills by then  until then? fuck, i 'unno "
"actually feeling a lot better about my breakup after the slam   it still aches a bit, but   i feel like i got a lot of that black stuff out by making a stupid metaphor or two about mario   i think i'll be okay "
"update time annoyed let's get straight to the video games annoyed playing plants vs zombies  highly recommend for any tower defense gamers  i can't believe i was so late to the party on this one  great fun!\delve deeper   interesting looking game from steam, haven't played it yet though \also got l4d2  already owned it for xbox, but now i have it on my laptop "
"i know that i made a post like this awhile back, but it stands saying again annoyed my god final fantasy 14 is    \boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing"
"so, odd moods lately  going from fine to sad to apathetically normal to pathetically sad to happy happy excited happy happy and back to fine and then apathy and   you get the idea \\apologies if i get weird on you all for it!"
"right, so i'm gonna curl up on the bed, place my laptop on the nightstand, and go to sleep with the soothing tunes of mystery science theater 3000 \the nerd in me cries tears of joy "
"right, so maybe i am a little happy today  maybe a lot  maybe happy   laugh "
"i feel a lot better  a lot, actually   of course much of that has to do with obtaining a girlfriend again  ^-^ but, that's not all of it  i just feel a lot   better, now  like i'm in a much healthier state of mind  mood swings still happening occasionally but, i'm feeling a lot better   "
"right, so this is going to sound odd but follow me on this one annoyed we must take a poll  if you could marry any cartoon character (movies, whatever counts so long as it is generally fake), who and why?"
"so, i'm playing minecraft and fable 3 mostly now  minecraft is fun but i need more ideas on what to do to my base, what to add on that might help or be cool  any ideas?"
"right   so i don't feel so good anymore   in fact i feel pretty, really bad "
"so yeah, actually i'm not exactly doing great, but i'm not exactly doing bad either  i think i'm starting to plateau and get back to normality for once  here's hoping "
"right, so i'm doing kinda alright, but it's reeally eerie how everyone around me is going through breakups and getting together  what the hell is in the air? a crazy mix of aphrodisiac and cyanide?"
"everyone, please take notice if you interact with me: i'm officially socially retarded  on a level unmatched by any other "
"so   i don't know  i'm not exactly sad lately  i'm just   weird  melancholy, i would always say when i was younger  it's a perfect word  i'm able to function, and able to be happy  but, i'm sad still  you understand? melancholy  it's an odd way to be "
"i know this will sound incredibly vague and very cliche at the same time somehow, but   you know what? i just don't get it "
"so i feel kinda alright today   laugh  i'm working on a new slam! worried about it seeming cliche, but it is an early-early draft, sooooo "
i can already tell i'm going to develop a stress-related problem in the future because of trying to apply for college now  fml 
"right, so our dog gave birth  litter of 7  they're very cute \i was watching her while everyone else slept, turns out she had the 8th one silently while i was just playing a game  i didn't pay enough attention   we lost the 8th one \besides that, i feel alright "
we lost another puppy somehow  down to 7  not feelin' so hot right now 
*over-used and generic lyrics to typical angsty teenage song and or currently famous pop-star song*
"right, so   dull sunday   post something for me to talk about "
huhm-de-huhm    
"oi, sometimes i wish i weren't so emotional "
"you know what i just realized? i've been so caught up in my own stuff, that i've forgotten and neglected my usual christmas spirit  it's a <propmale> late, but you know what? <propfemale> christmas everyone "
"proof i'm psychic: the puppies have opened their eyes  if anyone comments on this status, at least one person will say \aaaaaawwwww\"""""
oh we can all hope someday i'll learn when it's a good time to shut my damn mouth 
just so's ya know: terrordale is a lie 
here's to staving off insanity another day 
"minecraft: providing proof that i'm insane \what do i do after making a giant castlet hat can reach to the skies, filling it with a pool, archery range, storage chamber, bedroom, arena, painting-room, and hell-portal?\completely renovate it, of course "
sick of mood swings 
"so i think i hit writer's block somehow   i've got like 15 different slam poems started, and no idea how to continue any of them "
quickly! panic!
i got accepted into towson college 
generic wallpost  how're you all doing?
"really pissy mood today  extremely volatile, hopefully a shower will help, but i apologize if any of you all gett he reprecussions of me being bitchy today  how bouty ou all?"
"i apologize for making one of 'those' status posts, but honestly i'd like to submit to the council annoyed fuck relationships  i'm sick of being either abused, lied to, treated like shit, led on, and various other commonalities \honestly, is there not one single honest woman out there who is sane?\oh, wait   they're all with someone already \irony, isn't it \*fume*"
"another day, the same as the one before, only dusk seems to hold a little more blue, and a little less orange than before "
"update time: so i'm doing o<propfemale>  not great, not bad, just '<propfemale>  mood swings are the usual, it comes with being a teenager, bleh \been playing lots of freeware games  if you're into rpgs check out elona, very interesting "
"it's amazing how fast a great mood can turn into a very, very bad depression  its been awhile since i've had one of these depressions, it's kinda sad in itself  just   one of those days when i wonder why i'm still here if all i do is make people upset or angry \bah   hasn't killed me yet   "
"i'm really tired of being sick, missing the bus, or oversleeping for school  it always happens on a days, so now i always feel so guilty when i walk into chorus (which as men, is very small, so losing even 1 person is a huge detriment)  i didn't even do anything wrong and my own head is making me feel depressed about it  *sigh* dammit "
"doot de doo  random wall post  pretty good mood today  yesterday's visit to towson took a lot of stress off the idea of living on campus  no concerts, projects, or other big things in the way of school  good time overall "
