"\happiness is not the absence of problems but the ability to deal with them \"""""
what do you want from me?
there are no certainties in life-only opportunities
"standing here, beside myself "

nsb
honesty is a two way street 
"\reputation is what men and women think of us; character is what god and angels know of us \"""""

"we're only here for a short time, so make it a good time "
not a good night   
life is for livin not livin uptight 
the greatest gift you can give someone is your time 
<propfemale> williamson is the coolest person i know  smile 
guess if i was simple in the mind everything would be fine 
take a shower your attitude stinks
e playful ecting the world to treat you fairly because you are good is like e playful ecting a bull not to charge because youre a vegetarian 
bye bye beard  sad 
"life is a bitch, but i appreciate her "
i know you probably wish you never met me but i just wish you never forget me 
"\sometimes the best way to deal with shit is to not hold yourself as such a precious little prize \"""""
"\getting over a painful e playful erience is much like crossing monkey bars  you have to let go at some point in order to move forward \"""""
"i believe that life is a prize, but to live doesn't mean you're alive "
we can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are   or we can decide for ourselves 
"i think you stand under me, if you don't understand me "
i just want to be a good person and help people 
"i live in <propfemale>  i speak <propfemale>n, not spanish "
i'm a tool 
shit happens  that's life  get over it 
lax season 2011  you already know 
some people dream of success   while others wake up and work hard for it 
"got out of school early, got my car, and my license  pretty great day  thanks everyone for the birthday wishes "
"no one likes a hypocrite, so before you start pointing your fingers, make sure your hands are clean "
success is falling nine times and getting up ten 
"at the end of the day, the only person you can trust is yourself "
"season opener tonight, lets  go "
boone 11 lake brantley 7  hell yeah 
nobody raises their reputation by lowering others 
"life couldn't get better, this 'gone be the best day ever"
nothing worth knowing can be taught 
"i wish you, would step back from that ledge my friend "
there's no such thing as a half brother or half sister 
thank you to the girls who <propfirst> that incredibly hot chick on my dashboard 
"girls are like buses, it doesn't matter if you miss one or fifteen, another one's always gonna come around "
"you picked me up, breathed new life in me  i owe my life to you  \but for the life of me, i don't see why you don't see like i do "
to be honest    you dont need to make a facebook status to say how you feel about people 
lax bro in office \\m
