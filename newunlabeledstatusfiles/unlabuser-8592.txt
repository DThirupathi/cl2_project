is now officialy on the rpw roster  http annoyed  rebelpro co uk rpw-roster 
life is like a burning fire
missed training sunday but that wont happen often 
has an awesome new display picture
rpw show on saturday was amazing! faverate part of my match with <propmale> was when i got chokeslamed on the back of my head! it was painful and i could taste the blood but thats what made it so memorable 
is watching <propmale> <propfirst> dam vs <propmale> hardy for the hardcore title (2001)
is watching <propmale> <propfirst> dam vs kane at summerslam (2003)
watching <propfirst> evans  enough said 
going to go watch this weeks nxt 
life is like burning fire
just created an awesome new finisher  (blue bird slam)
is feeling kinda blue  can't sleep 
wwe banned chair shots to the head  how boring  
"\straight edge means im better than you\"" -cm punk-"""
"\creatures of the night\"" -<propmale> hardy-"""
some people are so blind 
my finisher is awesome -blue bird slam-
"just finished watching \the wrong side of town\"" staring <propmale> batista and <propmale> <propfirst> dam """
blue bird slam!
training today was awesome  im really impressed by everyone who was in my match  this is the first time ive ever put together a proper match and was really suprised by the reaction we got  the finish was fantastic  this was probly my faverate training match ever 
"i really need to do a dive over the top rope or something at training some time soon  ever since i nearly died (lol) at a show a few weeks ago ive been asking myself a question  \can i still dive over the top rope?\"" ive done it many times before but now something seems kinda different """
so the greatest wrestmania match was followed by the greatest raw episode i have ever known  like myself <propfirst> michaels found god and for this only good things will happen 
hmm well its 4am   might aswell go to sleep i guess 
really wish we had training this week 
nxt is so awesome  next week someone will be eliminated! i hope its <propmale> young  he just looks so ridiculous and he can't wrestle 
its killing me theres no training this week 
hmm well today turned out to be less boring than i thought but thats not allways a good thing  
i love being from the rock and roll <propfemale> of wrestling 
finally fount a website where i can order my style clothing  not that i dont like sheffield but ever since i moved here ive fount it very hard to find my style of clothing  there were a few good shops but not exacly what i was looking for  now i have finaly fount it! also im guessing this will have a slight impact on my wrestling look ^^ 
been doing loads of leg streches everyday now for the past month  making alot of progress and i think after 1 more month of this and i should be able to do the full splits easy ^^ 
"<propfirst> bourne used my \blue bird slam\"" finisher on wwe superstars this week """
training today was pretty good  had a great match with <propfirst>  i think my faverate part of the match was when i was setting up for split leg moonsault and <propfirst> caught me and hit an awesome slam  i forget the name  also i got to showed off my new rpw shirt 
cant wait for the next show   im totally gonna blue bird slam somebody 
would like to make my blue bird slam finishers debute at my next show and maybe even my other finisher i exchanged for my swanton bomb 
just ordered some knee pads 
"tomorow night at the rpw show in south kirkby, nothing will stop me from achieving championship gold  i will hit blue bird slam to any individual who dare gets in my way "
tonight at the rpw show in south kirkby i won the triple threat opening match and i won the main event <propmale> rumble match! last two people i eliminated were <propmale> and <propfirst>  so let this be a warning to all of you  im rising straight to the top 
393 show is gonna be awesome  also maltby sounds good 
was just looking at some pictures on <propfemale>'s profile from the rpw maltby show and the ceiling looks really low   this could work against me   
its amazing how many people suddenly go single on facebook  guys just dump girls from out the blue  some guys are just so dumb   
there are somethings in wrestling that are just so uncool  i mean is it too difficult to see things from someone elses point of view? everything is ego this and cocky that  cant you just be a champ and enjoy it?
split legged freakin moonsault!!!!!!!!!!
ah my new knee pads came today ^^
just modified my new knee pads 
i wanna make a song about chinese food!
tomorows show and saturdays show are gonna be awesome  blue bird slam!
"has just created a new wrestling focus called \sage mode\"""""
well the show is over and it was awesome! the crowd was slighly agressive and the ceeling was super low but it was a fantastic show 
393 show was awesome  got hit in the back by a cane  hurt lol but was awesome and i believe <propfemale> has got some awesome pictures 
i have to say every so often theres a show thats so good and i learn so much that it makes me sooo thankfull for the spot i have  and that spot was given to me problerly way before i was ready for it lol haha  after tonight i feel like im on a hole new level 
woke up this morning and my back is fine but my left knee feels pretty torn up some how  i would not have been able to make training  anyway im gonna try and take it easy for a few days and if its still bad then i guess ill go to a hospital to see whats up 
i look pretty damn hot in my display picture lol 
hmm  do people consider me an average height person? or a little under average   
my left knee seems to be all healed up now  i will be at training this week 
sooo close to being able to do the splits now!
finished lifting weights and is now doing leg stretches 
just had a shave ^^ and i only cut my self 36 times 
im so bored  won't somebody come along and make my life a bit more interesting lol  ^^
has got a new hairstyle 
training today was awesome  the high-flying part of the session was fun  i attempted to help some of the new guys which ended up with one of them giving me a slight noes bleed but whatever 
damn knee is giving me problems again  as if that wasnt enough already 
im gonna do the right thing now  i can see that alot of people wanna bring me down  but anyway im gonna put all this behind me and move on  i didnt mean to offend anyone  but my future means alot to me 
bought myself 2 three disc set wrestling dvd's today  the ladder match and the <propfirst> guerrero legacy  not that i really need it but i might pick up some new wrestling tips and stuff  ^^
back from spain and will be at training this week 
cant wait for this weeks training 
im having a good day ^^
i am a wrestler  i am the blue bird  i am unbreakable  i am a follower of god  i am <propmale> crow and i will not die 
"today i saw a baby bird fly out of its nest  it was doing pretty well untill it flew into my window that i had just cleaned   i was like \huhhhhhhhhhh!!!!????\"" i ermm couldnt breath i was laughing so hard  surprise """
just got back from karate which i havent been to in about 7 months and im glad i am just as good as what i was back then  maybe even better  ^^
i really like my new display picture 
i wish people could be more understanding and not make me make choices i dont want to make  well im a good person and i have a strong faith in god  im shure peace will return to me 
just got back from training and today ive been in the best tag team match ive ever been in or if not then its probly my faverate one  it would take too long to e playful lain why the match was so good but i can say that <propmale> <propmale> showed great natural ability 
the blue bird is feeling better today 
waiting 4 months to do a wrestling show is kinda dawning on me  i dont know how other wrestlers feel about waiting that long just to do a show but i mean i dont mind waiting but im young and i dont know what to say really  does anyone else have an opinion on this?
unfortunately i have just fount out that i have cracked my left heel  how this will effect my wrestling im not shure  im hoping its only very minor and i should be good for training and upcoming shows but may have to take it easy 
i got my new elbow pads today! ^^
thanks everyone  had a great 18th  involved no drinking and nothing incredibly stupid ^^
"it appears that family guy has stolen my character and put me in tonights episode  i aint gonna let this slide   and im not kidding  they stole my name, my look and   well this is not good "
just got the new <propfirst> jericho dvd  ^^
