getting used to my new life 
'how can i leave it all behind if i am coming back to it?how can i make a new beginning if i simply return to the old?' the answeris in the return u will not come back to the same old thing what u return to has changed because u have changed ur perceptions will be altered u will not incorporate into the status or world u left behind the river has been flowing while u were gone now it does not look like the same river

"i believe that everything happens for a reason  people change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so you appreciate them when their right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust noone but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together  - <propfemale> <propmale>"
