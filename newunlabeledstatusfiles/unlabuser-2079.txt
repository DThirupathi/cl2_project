"a soldier's demon in the fog of war believe me, unfortunately i know   a lot can happen in an instant in the instant after clear and present danger reveals itself  time then slows down, way down you hear bullets and shrapnel whizzing past you in slow motion, as if you could reach and pluck them out of thin air   the enemy from a friendâ€™s death cry"
"it is in this moment that you realize that you may be dead before your next thought is able to collect itself in your conscience your finger reaches for the trigger   you start shooting before you even aim as if your entire existence depends on firing your weapon you cannot think about anything other than survival not your past, not your family, and not your wife and kids  "
all the training means absolutely nothing no one in your training was willing to die in order to kill you now you start to see red  different shades of red  you feel anxious and cosy simultaneously  you feel inside of the whirlpool and yet on the outside of it as well   you feel profound and shallow at the same instant   brave and cowardly at once   right and wrong means nothing   
"only alive and dead are on your mind  with a wicked demon as your sole companion  while you wish for an angel in flight to pass by  as the dust settles you wonder when, how and why your mind is dull, yet your body could begin to flyis this the end or just another nightmare that will pass by no telling apart the screams of"
