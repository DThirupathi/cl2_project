i find it hard to argue with people because i alway see where they come from  i would make a horrible politician   haha
"i'm sorry, but <propfemale> spears new song is  soo  catchy! >< stupid simplicity!"
"so, on my way to the mailbox this morning, there stood a beautiful female pitbull  long story short i tried to find her owner by walking around  but no one hollard  i took her back (outside the apt) to give her some water and to call the ohs  but she ran away again! ><  now i feel so guitly  i tried to help a lost dog and failed "
slept all day and morning   
i wish i'd have some good luck for once

"man  idk how i got on the streams of youtube on kids getting bullied  it really upsets me, only because i know what they went through   this world needs to change  it makes me pissed off to hear people would rather take their own lives than to survive and overcome those scum-bags "
here's to being 22 
you know how you get a memory that came out of know where and you wish you did something about it and it just brought you to tears b c you actually regret  not doing anything about it  yea  i'm having that moment
