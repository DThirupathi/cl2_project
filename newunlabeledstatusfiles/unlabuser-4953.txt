"dreamed last night about an owl  it looked at me, turned it's head almost all the way around, then flug it back around to stare at me  when it did that, i woke up  had to turn the tv on because i was freaked out  for the past month i've been waking up between 4 and 4 smile 0 am  don't know what it means "

â€œnever let go of hope  one day you will see that it all has finally come together  what you have always wished for has finally come to be  you will look back and laugh at what has passed and you will ask yourself    'how did i get through all of that?â€�
"<propmale> used all his money he earned today on aiden: a pack of diaper, four packs of wipes, and batteries for his swing  then put the left over 56 cents in aiden's piggy bank  aiden was happy to see his daddy too  snuggled on his chest the whole time "
â€œbeing happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect  it means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections â€�
"aiden rolled over for the first time yesterday, and just did it again this morning  i was so excited i could have jumped up and down cheering  i'm so proud of him  he's growing so fast!"

"i'm going to trust that this is a blessing from god, and that we're not about to jump from the frying pan into the fire  the consensus is: yes!!!"
"â€œyour time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life  don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking  don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice  and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition  they somehow already know what you truly want to become  everything else is secondary â€�"
"i believe in jesus christ and have accepted him as my personal savior  one facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall  in the bible it says, if you deny me in front of your peers, i will deny you in front of my father at the gates of heaven  this is simple   if you love god and you are not afraid to show it, re-post this  just copy and paste   no shame here "

"aiden screamed for about three hours straight last night!  annoyed  but he's ok now  <propmale> took bruiser to get his hair cut, but they wouldn't see him because <propmale> didn't have his shot records  gotta go to my <propfemale>'s school, and then probably to get some groceries for the house  hope everyone has a good day!  love "
