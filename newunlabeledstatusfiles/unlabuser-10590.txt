i'm home now with the puppy and the kids! they all missed me so much    nothing is better than walking in the door and before i can even get my bags down
"nothing is better than two sweet little ones jumping on my legs one sharing her juice box with me and the other kissing my leg over and over, a cute puppy chewing on my new beautiful skirt out of excitment, while mom, dad and all their brothers and parents hugging me wishing me a happy easter, telling me how much they missed me and even more how much the three babies missed me (the two girls and the puppy) "
it's so awsome to be loved so much! it is late so i must go  i simply wanted to wish you a happy easter once more  night i love everyone----jenn smile

"today was not planned <propfemale> (the 4 yr old i take care of figured out how to unlock my bedroom door     but turned out to be a very relaxing day    woke with the kids and made them a yummy breakfest, got the girls ready for the park with their dad, while the kids played at the park i did a little shopping"
"old navy got a few new shirts and dresses and few sandles, bed bath and beyond and got a food scale and a 74 oz water jug, and the shoe dept and bought  very comfortable but cute sandles they are made to  get fit while you walk i will have to see about that one  wink  ,"
"watched a puppy trainning class- got a few tips and learned a little, bought tigger a ton of new stuff toys, treats, food, grooming supplies, trainning supplis and even a mini giant tire,"
"then went to dragon fly with the entire family, then to dairy qween, helped get the kids to bed set up tiggers new outside chain until we get our fence up, did a little tigger trainning, and now im just in bed enjoying a little \me time"""
"today i wanted to start one of my new books and relax in the grass with tigger to get some sun and some how i had an allergic reactions to the grass? i was in the grass for maybe 10 <propfemale>, then i started itching all over sat up and was shocked! so i went in the house and got a blanket to lay on "
"ive never been allergic to grass  one of my fav  things to do with the kids is to lay down at the top of a hill and roll but now i can't  sad  i just dont get it  all i know is i have many red bumps all over the front of my body arms, legs and chest! and to top it off i burnt my back "
even with all that said being out in the sun was so relaxing! i can't wait to do it again only next time i'll have to lay on a blanket not the grass lol  and wear a little sun screen lol !
"new update on my skin allergic reactions  i went to take a shower it's not just my arms, legs and chest it's mt entire body front and back  omg time for some benadryl!"
i jumped up on the stage with all 5 kids and became an drama class  it was out of my ordinary but was more fun than iâ€™ve had in a really long time  i had the kids hide in the back  i started each of the stories and as characters came in my head
"they hoped like frogs, grew like beautiful roses and defiles, burnt like fire flamed building, rained and pounded the floor to the sound of a scary thunder and lighting storm, and acted out a really fun bus ride driving up big hill, down slippery hills, hitting tons of pot holes and turning sharp turns "
"threw all the imaginary play i managed to teach them about stop, drop and roll, safety of a set belt, and being kind and welcoming to a lonely â€œtoadâ€� friend  what an awsome day to be a super nanny!"
"and to end the night my \boss\"" came into my room and said she loved me and said she would not know what to do with out me  you could'nt ask for a better day"""
update on my body spring cleaning i have burnt off the winter pounds  yay me! now the real work starts
"today i went to the most amazing park  its behind the waterfront hotel i think its called the waterfront web its so cool its a gym built outside not only do you get to workout, you get some sun while getting in shape, and the best part its totally free who ever thought of this is totally bright and my new fav person!"
ps i just have to say thank you so much!!!!! to a very dear friend of mine <propfemale> i dont know what id do with out you and haily we still have a date <propfemale> land tomorrow you and me may the luck be in you hands
"our plan     to stay at the park all day  we even brought my puppy tigger, but sure enough <propfemale>, <propfemale>, and i did all the planning and packing and we were rained out lol "
i would have just stayed and played in the rain because it was so warm but it began to thunder and the kids didnâ€™t enjoy the thunder so much  i kept telling them not to worry that it was just the sky storms playing a little music to entertain us and <propfemale> told them is was just angels in the sky playing bowling 
the kids didnâ€™t think it was as much fun as i did  they were all scared  so all the <propfemale> and <propfemale> ran all the bags to the car  while i gathered the kids and puppy
i had the kids calm down and enjoy the moment and walk to the car  i tried to teach them the appreciation and beauty of the calm before the storm  they all did but one  <propfemale> was scared the hole way i guess when you are truly scared there is nothing to change a frighten mind lol!
"when we got home the storm and the rain stopped of course  so the kids gave us a little fashion show (ripping all the clothes out of the closet) they introduce, bathing suits, summer wear, spring flowers, winter gear, and even alien world  it was really cute"
then they had a little popcorn part and played with <propfemale> pockets until it was time to go home  nal is out on a date with her husband rj and the little ones are fast a sleep while the older girls are chatting away about the 5th grade drama lol!
once again today was a fun day  now that i think about it everyday this week has been too much fun! not that there is such a thing as â€œtoo much funâ€�! thanks again <propfemale>! if the past week is how the summer is going to be i can't wait  it just might be one of the best summer's of my life!
"home for the weekend, wishing it was warmer"
ran 2 <propmale> tonight getting ready for the 5k sat  morning!
p s  mom thanks for the music!
another 3 mile     
broke my record today i went from running a mile in 15 <propfemale> to 11 smile 7 <propfemale>
off for my first 5k wish me luck!
"when i got there i told myself i could not stop running no matter how slow my running was and that i could not fall behind and run with all of the walkers and when i crossed the finished line i was alone right behind the runner but way in front of all the walkers, just as i had hoped to be"
today was the 5k and i did it  i ran the entire way  my running was mostly in slow motion but i never stopped to walk and that was what was most important to me  it was really hard but i was so proud of myself!
i ran it under 40 some minutes  there were a lot more hills than i thought would be  i forgot my ipod and my inhaler today  they are two very important necessities to me when i run but i still managed to succeed in the 5k 
"at the half way point i began to doubt myself but at every hill someone would be running or walking past, or working the 5k and they would cheer me on, give me a little support, and remind me how strong i was "
everyone was so awesome  almost everyone there were total strangers to me  as i began to feel weak they manage to help me move just a little further with just 2 or 3 simple little words of kindness  it was truly touching  i am very grateful 
as i ran to the finish line my picture was taken  my plan is to get a copy of that picture and frame it with my number 531 as a reminder â€¦  when i truly put my mind to it i can do it and the support of a strangers kind words will never be forgotten! even after the race people came up to me congratulating me on my success 
needless today it was all very touching  i am very proud  i also gave myself a little rewarded    some beautiful tops from forever 21 and got my 2nd hole ear piercing 
just got the kids to bed and ready to watch lovly bones     
had a great day shopping with the kids     i got the best b-day gift forr mom and my brother
just jogged from my moms house clear to sabraton  i wish i would have taken water with me i'd still be jogging! just wanted to thank the biker i meet today during my jog!
anyone know where to get really suppotive running shoes  i am really getting addicted to jogging long distance  i managed to over come my muscle pain and heavy breathing but the pain in my instep and toes are stopping and slowing me down!
today i had a great time working out with my mom  it's so nice to see her smile and make me smile!
"having a \sleepover\"" wilth the two little ones tonight!"""
nalini(my best friend&boss) is such a sweet heart  i have been a nanny for almost 9 years and worked for over 10 families and for the first time i was recognized as a mother on mothers day  i've never really e playful ected to simply because i'm not actually a mother
however i do everything a great mother does and sometimes more  today my boss took me out and got my nails done and a pedicure for mother's day and said i deserved it because i've become the best gift in her life and children  she truly is a blessing in my life i just don't know what i'd do with out her
wow my legs are still killing me i can run hours everyday almost every night of the week but 1 hr with a personal trainer and i am so sore  i hate stairs right now lol!

"i had an awesome workout with my trainer  we walked on the tedmill, did some squats, push ups, sit up and a few other leg exercises  he also focused a lot on the arm muscles with the dumbbells  then we did a few obstacle courses involving jumps, jogging, push ups, hopping, some sort of basketball sprinting, and back word running  it was a lot of fun  my favorite was the boxing  it made me feel strong and powerful!"
"<propfemale> worked out with me today so it was a really nice bonding with her  she is older so i don't get much time with her  i did talk to him a little about wanting to build my muscles and how long and sore i was last time he trained me  communication is great because i worked really hard, my muscles hurt but i'm not in pain!"
i never made it to my mom's house tonight poor tigger is sick  at 545 he vomited 4 times & has something hard in his stomach  at 730 he vomited white stuff sort of like mucus & foamy  the poor thing looks so sad when rj left for his run he put him outside then it started to storm he still would not come in so i picked his 70lbs of sad sick puppy inside we are taking him to the emergency vet clinic  i hope he's ok
"just checked out the pics online from the 5k i did in april  ive been very proud of how hard i've been pushing myself  i look at where i am now and where i was in april and i am just amazed  my legs are really starting to slim down   i still have a lot to go but like <propfemale> on finding nemo sings \just keep swimming\""!"""

"today i made a very yummy homemade (from scratch including the pie crust) avocado shrimp, & pepper quiche plus a salad with a homemade avocado and cucumber salad dressing  my way of  distracting from my painful itchy ankle and leg also my horoscope said i'd do something new and totally different and i had some avocados that needed eaten plus i've always wanted to try and make a quiche!"
the swelling in my ankle is almost down so it's not really painful anymore but the itchy has been unbareable the only thing that seems to take the itch away is afterbite itch eraser thanks <propfemale>!
made the kids homemade chocolate reese cup pudding for dessert they loved it 
"long work weekend is almost over i thought i'd be completly overwelmed having to care for all the kids, their friends, tigger, and the house but i'm kinda bumd"
"it's almost over  i really enjoyed it all     intertaining, nurturing, cooking, cleaning, and responsibility what a confidence boost!"
"the kids' grandpa came to help incase we needed a ride and when he left he gave me the best compliment   \jennifer you can and do everything\"""""
i've got so much out of this weekend (for myself) -financially mentally and emotionally  i'm also so glad the caseys finally got a <propmale> to get away together too!
"reflecting, and prioritizing,  instead of feeling negative i look at the positive which isnt always easy! i may not be as focussed on my physical goals but i put a dent on my financial goal this past week! as my long 92hrs in 7 days ends im excited im working so hard making up for lost hrs in june cant wait to finish this week maybe ill break my hrs worked in one pay roll!"
"even still im slightly frustrated with myself sun-wed i do awesome and then some how the week ends and i skiped way to many days running and still cant manage to find time for myself, family, boyfriend and friends  i guess this is what happens when you try and juggle to many things at once or maybe it's what has made me become so strong and confident    and sleep deprived lol  smile "
"this week priority     note to self \reminder you have one week to learn to parallel park\"" the test is in exactly 7 days! feeling the preasure!!!!"""
happy birthday <propfirst> if i wasnt so busy id try and party it up with you but im getting old too so i gotta stay focussed lol hope you have an awesome birthday!
just remembered why i got on facebook in the first place      
"bake it and youâ€™ll receive a ultimate impression and guides for you, your family and home "
"mix it altogether and it forms security\love, and inspiration "
"a bit of approval and appreciation, a speck of respect and admiration, a trace of compassion and affection, a morsel of obligation and responsibility, and a <propmale> of liability and burden "
"dash of discipline and reinforcement, a splash of patients and persistence, smidge of alertness and focus, a touch of consideration and judgment,"
"a drop of loyalty and dedication, a hint of empathy and selfless love , a spoonful of organization and multitasking , a pitch of imagination and creativity,"
nanny jennâ€™s recipe to becoming a super nannyâ€¦ 
"nannies come and go as will i, most important thing to always remember if weâ€™re ever apart i will always tay in your trusting hearts  i love you!"
"a nanny has no boundaries, when you choose to become nanny itâ€™s not simply just for the money  the bond of true family is not of blood but of love "
a small shout out to all the many families i have cared for and who have cared for me  thank you!
"tonight <propfemale> and i were watching the speecial features from the one of her <propfemale> movie  on the feature <propfemale> mcphee's music video connected came on  she turned to me very serous \how does that woman know their(<propfemale>'s) lanuage?\""      to only be a kid  again!"""
tonight i had another really great run freaked out a littel because it got dark faster than i hoped for but i did still push myself to workout for a hr and a half even in the dark which i dont ever plan to do again!
i did however look back at my post the past month and am slightly disappointed come tomorrow it will be a mth and im no longer going down in weight but staying the same  i have cheated way to many times and missed out on many of runs so its e playful ected
"i must end the night on a positive note      my weight may not have changed but im making more money allowing myself to eat more plus when i do run im going twice up to 6 times the distance i did a mth ago my speed is slowly getting faster too and ive notice more muscle in my legs and even my arms, and muscle replaces fat, muscle also weighs more!"
off to the wow factory when <propfemale> <propfemale> <propfemale> and <propfirst>
house full of girls running around before i even crawl out of bed today is going to be one busy day! gotta keep it exciting maybe we'll do homemade <propmale> today and make valcanoes!
"during the storm there was some really loud thunder i thought it scared <propfemale> so i hugged her but she said \don't worry im not scared that was my stomach\"" she must be hungry lol or just too cute im not sure which     """
off to the pool for a little lunch picnic and pool play with <propfemale> and <propfemale>
went to the lake on a boat with rj his 2 friends and their 4 little girls  i had a blast  it was so relaxing to get out in the sun! nice reward after 12 days of work with almost each day being a double!
"another stressing sleepless night any <propmale> anyone here in morgantown has a small car i can use for the driving test     i've thought long and hard and can't think of anyone, only larger trucks, jeeps, vans, etc     looks like my only option is to give the driving school a call!"
once more im either super positive or worried and obsessive how i ever went this long without a drivers license is beyond me! 10(oct)-05 is the dead line with 3 chances to pass 8 weeks away looking at all this takes away some of the preasure but only 2 weeks until school starts what to do    for now i must relax
i had the best night with my dearest longest will always be forever in my heart best friend and her husband <propfemale> i love you so much!
missing my celso but enjoying the last few nights of conversion     but  i must get to bed waking at 545am to start my 1 2 marathon sort of scared and sort of excited!
crossing my fingers my strength training does not make me sore seems i have not trained since i was 170

how fast life can change    girls are starting preschool in less than 2 wks rj has made it possible for both girls to go mon wed fri half day which means i will have 3 free mornings so i think it might be time to look into taking a few general classes somewhere so where to start

"imagine thisâ€¦ you make a beautiful absolutely perfect black <propmale> cake, then on the way to delivering the cake the heat and wv curvy crazy roads destroys the cakeâ€™s perfection! the top two layers move sliding into the lid of the cake plate   then the <propfemale> top ran down the side  yes a nightmare  nothing a little positive problem solving canâ€™t fixâ€¦â€¦ "

i pushed myself to run today     once again i ask myself     why idid  stop in the first place? i feel so great (mentally) its been weeks of stress and no running simply proved to me once more i need to run for more than just lossing the pounds and gaining the muscle!

"baking pies!     3 <propfirst> cream cheese, 4 pumpkin cream cheese, 1 oreo cream cheese, 1 apple, and a crazy concoction to use up the leftovers     an oreo crust, chocolate ice cream, oreo cream cheese filling, chocolate cake and whip cream   all should be very tasty but nothing can out do my plate licking <propfemale> chocolate glaze vanilla cake!"

gave a little advice to my little sister tonight and gave myself a little reminder as well    
"simply  gained from it all       its hard       but one day the tears of pain will end and you'll begin to accept new life and feel stronger and wiser about your own self and all you need and <propfemale> to be hole again, to build and trust in new relationships, e playful erience happiness unfortunately yet again more saddness,"
"learn, appriciate and gain knowledge about yourself, life, and others  love should give you comfort but never let love become comfortable or the flame will simply die and all you are left with is resentment  just hold onto the good days and even the bad years, the happy laughs and even the sad tears, the furture dreams and even the present disapointments"
"moving on is simple, it is what you leave behind that makes it so difficult! just enjoy each and every lovable exciting memorable moment! never forget each and every one of them, no matter how easy it is to feel hate in order for you to move on never forget the memories, remember the joy!  but do not hold onto what's comfortable "
"sometimes nice simply doesn't work  annoyed       i go for the hear,  listen then and speak method    just make sure your speech is listened to more than heard      big difference    not so much in the sound you use but the <propfemale> and words you choose to use!"
off to pittsburgh with the <propfirst> family for the day
"presents are starting to arrive! i don't think i'll ever shop in an actual store again   this online shopping has been the smartest thing ive ever done! i some what managed my spending better, bought unique gifts, plus a bonus i didnt even think of as each dilivery is dropped off  i wrap it no more endless night of gift wrapping!"

"imagine we all have a bucket within us that needs to be filled with positive e playful eriences, such as recognition or praise  when we're negative toward others, we use a dipper to remove from their buckets and diminish their positive outlook  when we treat others in a positive manner, we fill not only their buckets but ours as well  \\so how full is your bucket?"
