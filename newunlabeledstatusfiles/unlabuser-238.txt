"looks like the packers will win a very sloppy, interception-filled game at home to gain the playoffs   color me unimpressed "
"please join me in mourning the passing of <propfirst> carlson, a very kind and gracious woman who has left this life due to cancer   i knew her slightly due to helping the hrc campaign (and staying allied with hrc dems ever since)       she will be greatly missed "
"i wonder where my other status update went from earlier today about poor <propfemale> giffords; wrote a quick blog, which is available at my elfyverse wordpress com site, about what was known as of 4 pm est   haven't been back long enough to hear an update; how is she doing?  does anyone know?"
i see fb changed my profile   i hope they got some enjoyment out of it   i surely didn't 
"mom left something behind at the grocery store today and thought it was gone forever   it wasn't; i called, and sure enough, it was there -- i went and got it for her   there are still good people on this earth and today it was proven to us, once again "
"for my n r and haven friends       i'm being affected by the fb issue, thus am having trouble getting and sending gifts and even playing the games   sometimes i can play, sometimes i can't, but no matter what i do i can't send gifts   hope n r and haven fixes whatever they need _soon_ "

got over to mom's   she says i look awful and if i'm no better tomorrow i'd best go to the er 
still more sick than well   stayed in today and slept   i hope to be able to get out tomorrow and do _something_ 
still way under the weather   i can do about three things per day -- minor things -- then i'm done   tomorrow i will have to drag myself into the doctor and hope they'll see me despite my lack of money and insurance 
"went to doctor; verdict -- sinus infection plus bronchitis   antibiotics given; i've just started 'em   have to take mucinex plus sudafed, use more saline nasal sprays (i've been using 'em, but i guess more?), and i have a cough syrup for night-time use "
"the antibiotics hit me really hard   i'm up now, but was asleep just about all of saturday   i hope today won't be another washout; i'm tired of being ill "
feeling much better today   wrote a very short story this morning       glad my creativity has returned 
"bad winter snowstorm here; nearly impassable roads, snow blowing sideways, few trucks out   if you live in se wisconsin or northern il, stay home   (i wrote a blog saying the same thing, fwiw )"
"weather continues at white-out or near white-out conditions   car is in driveway and drift is up to the engine, at least       bad wind gusts continue   dogs can't go out in this   really don't like this weather at all "
"mom and i managed to clear the furnace vent by throwing hot water at the snowdrift until we could see it, then using the broom to clear the snow   it took almost two hours   (back stoop is fairly clear but that's all; used the hot water method to clear it so we could get at the vent )"
"dad was approached by two con artists claiming to be from the water dept   they cased the joint while he was downstairs running the water (they said a sewer main was broken)   dad is not hurt   apparently nothing was taken; my things (including instruments) are still there, and my computer is still there also   police have already taken a report "
still blocked in with the huge drifts   we won't know whether or not my mom's male friend can get here for hours yet -- there isn't much mom or i can do to affect the situation   (but at least we got the furnace vent unblocked   that's something )
"mom's friend came, got a pathway for the dogs in the back, and a path through the front walk   still can't get out   we're trying to get additional help; he'll come back tomorrow if we can't find anyone "
"we're dug out; streets are mostly barely passable   got to dad's   three pieces of jewelry, one costume, was taken from my room   police report has been filed   the robbers even looked through <propfirst>'s ashes, trying to find something of value   i feel soiled "
"temp is back up over 100 f   antibiotics are working but the stress of the past few days has taken its toll   those of you who've commented about the recent crises, thank you   those of you who cared but did not comment -- thank you, also "
"various folks have been posting and reposting about the need for health care in the usa   i agree with them, but would rather write my own posts about the subject   we're in a crisis due to the lack of affordable health care and anyone who doesn't see that is a fool "
"super bowl is a big mess   fans turned away 'cause seats are unsafe   half-time show mix is bad, which didn't help the singers       so far the packers appear to be the far better team, but the second half awaits   i think the packers have the edge, but i am actually rooting more for those poor fans who ended up with no seats "
"doctor said three things:  1) i have a sinus infection (he thinks the bronchitis is gone), 2) he's moving out of the area, and 3) i lost six more pounds   (one pound per month, but at least i'm not gaining )"
"rihanna's dress at the grammy's -- awful   yes, it fits her   yes, it's see-through   yes, it's tacky   she can sing, but she can't dress "

"moveon org stands with the protestors in wisconsin who are fighting for their rights to collectively bargain; even though i broke with moveon org years ago over other issues, i stand with them in this    what gov  <propmale> is trying to do is plain, flat wrong "

"broke big block, writing-wise, last evening after some good advice from a friend received       came out compressed, so the 4k i wrote probably will end up being 9 or 10k once i figure out what else needs to be there   (but i wrote _action scenes_, *not* setup as i had been doing   yay!)"
"hoping for the best w r t japanese earthquake tsunami       many, many dead and worst of all, they can't get to some of the more rural areas due to damage to roads, bridges, etc , so there's undoubtedly more injured people who haven't been taken to hospitals yet   keeping my fingers crossed "
"lots and lots of writing tonight       six reviews (two for shiny book review, four for amazon com) and 2200 words of fiction later, i am tired yet exhilirated   wink "
car overheats; back in shop   car is 14 years old and it's probably something to do with the radiator   let's hope it's a cheap repair because that's all i can afford 
"no word on car   garage had no time for it, or me, today   we'll see tomorrow "
car is fixed and i can pick it up tomorrow (they fixed it about two minutes before close of business)   it needed a radiator hose that's just underneath the main radiator apparatus; the reason my car overheated is because there was _zero_ coolant in the car 
"car is fixed   seems to be ok now   broke until next week, but at least i have my car   smile "
"<propmale> schultz just reported at msnbc that there now has been *some* looting in japan   i wrote 150 words at my blog about it       no video yet has been posted online, or if there has been, i'm too ignorant to find it   if *you* find it, please let *me* know and i'll add it to my blog "
