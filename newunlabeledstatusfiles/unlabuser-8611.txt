"well   i didn't win the tournament; i didn't get very far to begin with  but, i learned a lot about what i'm up against, and of my own play style  some tourney veterans even complimented me on how well i did do--despite this being my first official tournament  so, i may not have won anything material--but i did win knowledge, and spiritual contentment  so, with this in mind, i will strive to get better and do better "
