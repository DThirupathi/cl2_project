"it's odd, when you live where tans are worshipped    to suddenly become a novelty for your pale skin"
there's something magical about the first fireflies of summer   
"i love you, <propfemale> wagler "
"with my whole heart have i sought thee: oh let me not wander from thy commandments \ps  119:10"
"o august rainshowers, how i do love thee   "
"i love you, september "
