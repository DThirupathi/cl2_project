everything you could ever fathom is nothing compared to the vast knowledge and wisdom that lives in you 
the one pair of shorts i own don't have holes in it i've had the longest and i paided $50 for     thoughts?
shape the world or watch someone else shape it for you 
finally going camping in la grande  my adventurous heart will be revived  so you in a couple days fb people 
camping so going to be sooo awesome 
watching stripes 
was ahead of zach by 72 points on scrabble and he forfeited   
just watched the curious case of <propmale> button      i think i might have something wrong with my tear ducts    
i pray for favor in you on you and that the favor of god will go before and behind you and into every area of your life 
it's to believe who you are  and live for today 
live a life excited for the future  if you aren't excited for the future  let yourself dream and think of the great things to come 
camping again?!?!?! two weeks in a row  of course i will 
"dream with me, dream for the years  dream for the laughter  dream away your tears!! dream with me  dream for today "

i think zach <propmale> finally gave up playin me in scrabble    
it's not over till you want it to be  life continues and grows  the options an possibilities e playful and with you not from you  where and what is next is an option no one can decide but you  dream bigger than you have ever dreamed before  and make efforts to obtain those dreams  live life to the fullest  do everything imaginable and unimaginable  coming back down is optional  reaching the top is vital 
pray for a financial outpouring

so they didn't have peant butter panda puffs     so i had to get peanut butter puffins      sad day 
can you feel it? you where made for this moment 
the meaning of life is to grow  to not be confined but what we can imagine or logically conlude from our surroundings but to stretch our capacity of thoughts  to learn grow change live and love  don't be stagnant  a stagnant lake turns into a cesspool     
perception is everything  open yourself up to the perception of others to understand them  and the perception of god to help the 
well     i guess it's time to skate
