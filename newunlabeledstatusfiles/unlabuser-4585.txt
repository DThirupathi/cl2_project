i kinda regret this
insomnia
amazed by how many people accepted requests from me without knowing me
i'm made friends with a dog! and spoke to it on chat!
a brainstorm
in need of a boss crew! cause boss is suffering without <propmale>
i'm going to six flags alone
why do i suck so much? why do i live alone? how do you guys even tolerate my existence?!
"philadelphia is \cream cheese\"" in italian"""
i managed to get an interview with six flags
is bored of his gourd
i got a job at six flags! now hopefully nothing will come up at the background check
insomnia
seriously i'm starting to doubt many things and its driving me to the point of insanity and depression
i watched marly and me    that kind of stuff just gets to you
i'm scared to death that i will never be afraid
i am happy! we are going to see so much stuff in new york! i'm bursting with excitement

"in each of us there are 2 natures \\if this primitive duality of our lives, good and evil, could be housed in seperate identities, life would be relieved of all that is unbearable \\it is a curse of all of us that these polar twins should be constantly struggling "
lessons not learned in blood are easily forgotten 
i got a girl's phone number at work today! when i called it she picked up! yay!~
