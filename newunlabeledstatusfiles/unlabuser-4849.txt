how could this happen to me? i've made my mistakes got nowhere to run the night goes on as i'm fadin' away i'm sick of this life i just wanna scream how could this happen to me? everybody's screamin' i try to make a sound but no one hears me i'm slippin' off the edge i'm hangin' by a thread i wanna start this over again
something kinda sad about the way that things have come to be  desensitized to everything  what became of subtlety? how can this mean anything to me if i really don't feel anything at all? i'll keep digging till i feel something 
"today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration  that we are all one consciousness e playful eriencing itself subjectively  there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves  here's <propmale> with the weather "

the peices of my broken heart are so small they could pass though the eye of a needle  i miss you like the sun misses the flower in the deep of winter 
"stay with me awhile rise above the vile name my final rest poured into my chest into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead halo of death, all i see is departure mourner's lament but it's me who's the martyr"
please remedy my confusion  and thrust me back to the day  the silence of your seclusion  brings night into all you say  pull me down again  and guide me into pain  i'm counting nocturnal hours  drowned visions in haunted sleep  faint flickering of your power  leaks out to show what you keep
i thought you loved me you never gave a fuck why did you have to go and take my life from me i'm looking in your eyes i finally realize that everything you said was taking life from me and nothing feels the same these memories still remain why did you have to go and take my life from me and then you say your sad lost everything you had still everyday you're always taking life from me
"gasping for another breath  she <propfemale>, screaming at closed doors  seductive faint mist forging through the cracks in the wall  i shant resist  in tears for all of eternity  she turned around and faced me for the first time  run away, run away  just one second, and i was left with nothing  her fragrance still pulsating through damp air  that day came to an end  and she had lost in me, her credence "
"deserted again you speak to me through the shadows walking in closed rooms, using cold words captured by the night the yearning escapes from my embrace strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts, scream your sadness and they all turned away, unable to face more of this death credence in my word written in dust, tainted by memories i confess my hope, recognize my loneliness your laughter weeps the truth"

"there you are alone with no hope of ever having something to be proud of something earned without begging yes, i know you're a person a person close to me who do you think you are? what more do you want from me?"
i'd rather do nothing and be happy then do something i hate 
give me something good and i'll fuck it up all my life i've tried but never had much luck to be happy but i guess it's just not meant to be i'm gunna die a loser i'm sorry family and friends i always wanted to be something you could all be proud of all i am is a mess and you still give me every <propmale> in the world and all of your love
"i'm searching for reasons to keep away the demons and i'd die again for you i wish you were near me could feel it when you hear me say i'd die again for you so kill me with the love that you won't give to me, give to me and pack the wound with salt i wanna feel it bleed, feel it bleed you wanted me to crawl so now i'm on my knees, on my knees"
"i stand motionless in a parade of falling rain your voice i cannot hear as i am falling again devotion eludes and in sadness i lumber in my own ashes i am standing without a soul she wept and whispered: \i know   \"" we walked into the night am i to bid you farewell? why can't you see that i try when every tear i shed is for you?"""
"you gave me this, made me give, your silver grin, stil sticking it in you have some machine, soul machine the longest kiss, feeling furniture day drift madly to you, pollute my heart, drain you have broken me, broken me all your mental armour drags me down, nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth"
and now i look through my minds eye and see where my past needs to rest its always disturbed by these voices that <propfemale> inside of my head another way that i can hide another reason to crawl inside and get away  from everything and everywhere and everyone no! its all these demons haunting me its all these little things trapped inside of me releasing me from all my sin
words you say never seem to live up to the ones inside your head the lives we make never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead the day i tried to live i wallowed in the blood and mud with all the other pigs i woke the same as any other day you know i should have stayed in bed
"the blood's on the wall so you'd might as well just admit it and bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it you're better off empty and blank than left with a single pathetic trace of this smother another failure, lay this to rest console yourself, you're better alone destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck absorb yourself, you're better alone destroy yourself"
"i hear you calling, voices are here again i hear you whisper, taking control of me watch the dancing shadows run away all alone once again, afraid all these faces, changing their shapes on me i said laid it in my own world, will it ever be free? haunted figures around me, i want em' to stay there always there to protect me, this is one thing you can't take away"
i love when the blackhawks are away and the home crowd boo's their own team cuz they can't get it from us   smile 
"one more step and i could fall away if it happened would it matter? i can't tell if i should go or stay same old picture feels so hollow how can anybody know what's best for me? another <propfemale> i turn in shame my decisions brought me to my knees i needed someone to blame i feel so hollow time to do what's best for me, i believe i can change"
"there's those thinking, more-or-less, less is more but if less is more, how you keeping score? means for every point you make, your level drops kinda like you're starting from the top you can't do that society, you're a crazy breed hope you're not lonely without me society, crazy indeed hope you're not lonely without me"

"branded like an animal i can still feel the burn in my mind i do believe that youâ€™ve made your message clear deprivating, isolating, all that i feel, leaving me with images i know are not real  are those words of condemnation that i hear? i think i'm losing my mind, i think i'm losing my   "

"hey, i'm feeling tired  my time, is gone today  you flirt with suicide  sometimes, that's ok  hear what others say  i'm here, standing hollow  falling away from me  falling away from me"
"risk my soul, test my life for my bread spend my time lost in space am i dead? let the river flow through my callused hands and take me from my own the eyes of the damned it makes my stomach turn and it tears my flesh from the bone how we turn a dream to stone and we all die young yeah we all die young"
"lost, here is nowhere searching home still turning past me, all are gone time is now the omen showed, took me away preparations are done, this can't last the mere reflection brought disgust no ordeal to conquer, this firm slit it sheds upon the floor, dripping into a pool <propmale> me sleep, take me under like the wings of a dove, folding around i fade into this tender care"

"there is a wound that's always bleeding  there is a road i'm always walking  and i know you'll never return to this place  gone through days without talking  there is a comfort in silence  so used to losing all ambition  struggling to maintain what's left once undone, there is only smoke  burning in my eyes to blind  to cover up what really happened  force the darkness unto me"
i let myself fall into a lie i let my walls come down i let myself smile and feel alive i let my walls come down no matter how i try i don't know why you push so far away you wrapped your hands tight around my heart and squeezed it full of pain  with this knife i'll cut out the part of me  the part that cares for you with this knife i'll cut out the heart of me the heart that cares for you
how i drape my face with my bare hands the same that brought me here but you were beyond all help the folded message that wept my name shadows skulk at my coming we survey the slopes in search for the words to write the missing <propfemale> the tainted dogma time grows short as the <propfemale> plays his time we are almost there you are beyond all help dancing into the void we are almost there

"found a way to rid myself clean of pain\and the fever that's been haunting me\has gone away\\looking through my window\i seem to recognize\all the people passing by\but i am alone\and far from home\and nobody knows me\\never heard me say goodbye\never shall i speak to anyone again\all days are in darkness\and i'm biding my time\once i am sure of my task i will rise again"

"you're the fire that warms me when i'm cold you're the hand i have to hold as i grow old you're the shore when i am lost at sea you're the only thing that i like about me\\and in this world where nothing else is true here i am still tangled up in you i'm still tangled up in you"
"you see i'm tired of feeling this pain i'm tired of living my own little lie and it makes me wonder when i see you in my dreams does it mean anything are you trying to talk to me \\i'm a stranger in my home tell me are you feeling alone someone tell me what to do 'cause i'm feeling strong and i wonder how you feel do you realize my pain is for real i see you in my dreams and i wonder if you're looking down at me"
"deeper and deeper and deeper is all i'm turning to! living a life that seems to be a lost reality that can never find a way to reach my inner self esteem is low! how deep can i go in the ground that i lay? if i don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind  this time i look to see what's between the lines!\\i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind"

"there was a time that the pieces fit, but i watched them fall away mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting i've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication"

longest day ever
"feel like shit, work tomorrow  woopie!"
"through the woods, a girl came sadly  something broken in her chest  she had dared to love another  alas, no better then the rest  up my path a girl came gladly  something opened up my doors  i longed to stop her bleeding heart  and so i called her to my shores  those you trust will hurt you badly  something now i'm sure you see  so drown your tears in me, my dear  as you drown, my dear, in me "
