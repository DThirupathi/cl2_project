public speaking and chem lab   monday classes are going to be a hoot! time for the dining hall   let's check out what my parents are paying their hard-earned dollars for 
half of my heart is back in bethpage 
i know i just posted a status moments ago   but i just have to share this moment with the facebook world   just got into my dorm   pants are soaked (mind you if i had my boots would not be)   cold   tired   hungry  so i opened a good ol can of classic chicken noodle   slapped some crunchy peanut butter on some bread   and man did it lift my spirits!
knowledge acquired from the evening    walmart in cookeville tennessee is sold out of umbrellas  ranch baked potatoes at backyard burger on campus are well worth the walk at 9 oclock at night  it also only rains in this city when all us poor college students have to go to class    it especially rains more on those less fortunate whose rainboots don't arrive till next tuesday 
arrival at library 7:59 p m  departure from library  11: 07 p m  no matter what grade i make on my organic chemistry midterm tomorrow   i will sleep well tonight knowing my determination will well exceed what ever the outcome    smile  wish me luck  cam   sweet dreams angel  <propfemale> rutherford    your gaaayy   smile 
is wishing she wasn't going to be an hour away from her loverboy on his big 18! happy birthday camdon <propfirst> green!  love you angel
