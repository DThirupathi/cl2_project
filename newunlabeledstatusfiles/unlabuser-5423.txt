"the silent hill series are the best games ever hands down  i seriously wonder why team silent would give their masterpiece away to people who will botch its beauty \\on a side note, i looked back on my <propfirst> sullivan obsession    sullivan is amazing because for some reason i can see him as an extension of myself, however there's no logical e playful lanation for it, so what the hell?"

i need to make a decision  now 
screw msn! i think i need to get off my lazy ass for once and actually post my crap on facebook 
status updating madness 
i think i need to liven up my facebook with funnier posts  stay tuned  (i hope this won't be too hard   )
my computer just wiped all of my saved bookmarks and passwords in firefox and even in aim msn so i lost my old aim felenx because i completely forgot the password  t_t so add my new one: penellykins
it's so degrading when owners dress their pets up in silly clothes   annoyed

screw logic  intuition is what connects us all as human beings  it's sad very few understand its importance 
i need to learn how to stand up for myself and speak my mind for once  i'm going to work on that once i can 
i hope the next time i face someone obnoxious i will actually go ahead and chew their face off for being an idiot
