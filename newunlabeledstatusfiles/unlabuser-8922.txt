windrock is awesome this year 
"bp is paying ridiculous amounts of money to cleanup workers  if you're not a doctor or lawyer i highly recommend that you get in on a crew for a couple days a week  25,000 people and 8,000 boats and counting  there's tons of jobs "
"professional road cycling blows right now  it's the most dishonorable, unsportsmanlike display of pretentious bullshit i've ever witnessed (apart from every triathelete i've ever met (of course))  their version of sportsmanship is some random bullshit niceity  sportmanship isn't about subtleties  it's about an uncontrolable love for your sport that results in outrageous heroicism "
incredibly psyched to be going to snowshoe with a good crew 
100% sold on the leatt brace now  it is just as essential for dh as a helmet
