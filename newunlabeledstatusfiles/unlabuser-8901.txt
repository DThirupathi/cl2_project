"go red sox!  win up some superbowl!\\in other news, winter camp was awesome   i know of no other church event which allows, much less condones, the riding of donkeys   <propfemale> la <propfemale>!"
"to all my sister's friends who have been inquiring of how she is annoyed \she says her face feels like it's been run over by an 18-wheeler and then e playful loded   and that's an improvement "
the <propmale> is dead

"was not hugged by much of anyone, even though it's hug a tall person day  sad    well, at least not because of the day "
it feels weird to be back in a world where people won't understand me if i start speaking chinese 
"english buddies: what do i, as the attorney, have to prepare for tomorrow for the trial?"
i think i'll like <propfirst>'s day a lot more when i have a <propfirst>   now i'm just apathetic about it 
"today kinda was terrible, but i have learned much and tomorrow will be mine "
"my sister is having another surgery done tomorrow   the last one failed   prayers wanted, needed, and appreciated "
"y'know, i think the mock trial would have been a whole lot more fun if i hadn't looked like a fool one day, and then hope that i had done well enough to win with a bad case on the second day, only to then be accused of winning only because of dishonorable conduct   i don't mind debate   i do mind the personal insults that followed this one "
the importance of being <propmale> was awesome 
"is it strange that i feel the most faithfully (i mean faith in the sense of steadfast and trusting, as the bible uses it) and truly christian after having read an argument against it's truth, and furthest from that same faith and truth when i have just argued for it?"
"good night, world "

"there's something that doesn't love perfection, in people, in appearance   there's something so fake about trying to make things that aren't perfect appear that way, that makes me yearn the world would take off all its make-up and pretty clothes and jewelery and just see the refreshing beauty of the reality of our imperfection "

"the <propmale>'s speech is a truly great movie, but not in the way most are   during it, i wasn't all that impressed   there were no great climactic struggles, no great battles won   when i walked out of the theatre, i was struck by a feeling of wonder and hope that most movies can't   it's the type of movie that's like an iceberg; it's message is subtle   it's simplicity makes it great "
