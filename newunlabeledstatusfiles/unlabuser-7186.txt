i have no clue what to ask for my b-day
i am putting up a ladies gentlemans bet   the bet is that nobody can listen to the tune of shiping up to boston and find it catchy 
"cant sleep, college tommorow"
"first day, kinda nice smile "
"computer went nuts today, but works now     taking it in at thanksgiving"
sending this thing to apple to get fixed    if i can remember the number 
"got a care package from grandma a few days ago, with an apple the size of a softball!"
found shockers are not discontinued!  loved them as a kid!
"man, comm homework is so dull!  nothing but researching a speech topic and writing an outline "
"scratch that, calc is worst   very tricky   might just drop   "
hilighter was pretty fun 
"just great, bike got stolen    at least i dont have to worry about bringing it home now "
"thanks for the care package, perked me up after worrying about my calc test   thanks so much "
"look out <propfirst>, the <propfemale>'s gonna eat you!"
freezing!!!  windows broken and letting snow in 
"got destroyed by my calc final   ghf, done with monmouth for a while   bring on the cruise!"
"guess even college gets a snow day, even if its not too bad out now"
"my printer is possessed   tried to print something before class, wont print   come back, the second i say print, it starts printing what i wanted    from an hour ago!"
anyone see jump city seattle?  those guys sure look like they have fun   
this is one sweet storm!
