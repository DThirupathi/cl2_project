"ready for the night!  c'mon, <propfemale>, you bastard "
"datsik, you win  laugh "
"my mind's distracted and diffused \my thoughts are many <propmale> away\they lie with you when you're asleep\and kiss you when you start the day"

"but when i awoke dear, i was mistaken\so i <propmale> my head and i cried"
