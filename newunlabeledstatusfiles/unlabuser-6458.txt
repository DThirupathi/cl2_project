"    and turn right back around and head back to honolulu   back to the classes, and tests, and the unending cyclical minute routine that distracts from the violent reality that is life "
"and yet again i feel myself being let down   <propmale> palahniuk, oh how you disgrace yourself   your decline began with diary and took a turn for the worst with haunted   i thought perhaps you were going to make a recovery with rant, but i see my hopes amount to nothing   snuff offered little improvement, but pygmy is a sure sign that your writing abilities have died "
