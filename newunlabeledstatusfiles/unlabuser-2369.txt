don't dislike me; get like me  smile 
don't dislike me; get like me  tricks & haters only get mad when they figure out that they can't top my success  its not my fault i was created to be the best http annoyed  thefashionmimic webs com
chillin' with the cousins
"blah, blah, blah"
"so, i was trying to update my myspace and whatnot and i ended up erasing my whole profile    fml    really? it took me a long time to fix the <propfemale> up and now i have to do it all over again    omg!     well at least i had a good day today    missing <propfirst>!"
"when i discipline myself to eat properly, live morally, exercise regularly, grow mentally and spiritually, and not put any drugs or alcohol in my body, i have given myself the freedom to be at my best, perform at my best, and reap all the rewards that go along with it"
"thought of the day: \the world didnt give it to me  and the world can't take it away  to god be the glory\"" i have to constantly remind these low-life's that they cant take anything from me  and at the same time i need to keep in mind that the world owes me nothing """
"\everyday is a day of thanksgiving  god has been so good to me  everyday he's blessing me \"""""
"if you judge ppl a whole lot & you're not getting paid for this occupation, then you're not a critic, you're a hater  9 times out of 10 a hater will never admit they're hating  & for an added note    if you begin a sentence with \i aint hating but_____\"" then you're hating!"""
"why are we willing to risk our lives for some things and not others? because it's easier to trust in things rather than people  read more of what i have to say here: http annoyed  fashioncantbetamed webs com click on \blah blah blah\"" blog!"""
"another great feeling in the world is not only falling in love, but falling out of love with someone who never really loved you "
faith is trusting in god even though you don't understand the situation you're in  god allows us to go through a struggle so that we can learn to depend
on him and build our faith 
take the time to do it right cause you may not get the time to do it over  one day your life will flash before your eyes    make sure its worth watching
ugh! why is my little sis dressed like me? (red&black)  she knows i like to be different and stand out from the rest    heading to church    flattered  wink

"waiting on my mama to come pick me up so i can go to one of my favorite stores (rainbows)  i think i might buy a dress, shirt&leggings, or some cute sandles    dont know yet    bored and tired at the moment!"

"god never cease to amaze me    after a good cry and a long talk with him, my world seems a whole lot brighter and all of a sudden, i have more to look forward to than i did before  god is truely my best friend    to the end  smile "
"sorry, but i just got to clear up these rumors  no, he's not my boyfriend    he's just my sponsor  wink "

"even though you're a million <propmale> away, we still think alike  the way these haters talk about me makes me want to fight  but then i hear your voice and all of a sudden i feel alright  may you rest in peace during the storm, here's a *kiss* and a g'night "
"they say, 'never judge a book by its cover' but isnt the cover trying to sell you the book? so, girls: your dresses should be tight enough to show you're a woman and loose enough to show you're a lady  always dress the way you want to be addressed"
"whew! <propfirst> was a handful this weekend  such an active little 2yr old  and because of him, i dont want to have kids anytime soon    he's all i can handle right now  anyways,these last couple days has been hectic    i'm tired and    zzzzzzz  sad  hollerrr"

"i'm feeling \friend sick\""     i miss having real friends & real family  what happened to the those days when people said \""i love you\"" and really meant it?? or what about when they said they'd \""always be there\"" or when they convinced you that they \""understand where you're coming from\"" i don't see the real thing out there anymore  everybody just loves taking me to hell and back  why?"""
"rise and grind! what i want? a successful online clothing store, two in-mall stores, a feature in seventeen, nylon, etc   , a bestseller (novel), and a business degree    (www twitter com foreverashleyj)"
