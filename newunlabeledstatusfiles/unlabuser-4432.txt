i am officially double majoring now in psychology and business  i am pretty sure this education path will help me to conquer the world  does anyone ever get two phd's because i can't choose which way to go?
i came to the horrible realization that i won't be able to have children until i am 29 and i still didn't add in all the time and work it will take to win a nobel prize  and when am i going to fix world hunger and develop a treatment for every disorder in the dsm  so really i cant have kids until i'm 325 years old
"i'm starting a movement to make words like \smile\"" and \""pile\"" to be considered 2 syllable words because pile takes more effort and mouth changing movements then the word pull  pi-ul vs pul   different but pi-ul and pad-ul \""paddle\"" are closer see what i mean   who is with me?"""
