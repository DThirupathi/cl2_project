"i normally don't do these copy and paste status things, but this one is well deserved  smile  >>if you have a wonderful husband, fiancÃ©, or boyfriend that works hard to take care of you and would do anything for you, then repost this as your status to give the honest good men out there the recognition that they deserve  because    great men are few and far between, and i have one of them!"
"well, i got a break this quarter, i might not be so lucky next time so no more procrastination!!!!"

"â€œa loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself -- to laugh with me, but never at me; to cry with me, but never because of me; to love life, to love himself, to love being loved  such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart â€� <propfirst> f  buscaglia"
