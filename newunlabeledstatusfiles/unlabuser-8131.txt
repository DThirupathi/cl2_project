"one day <propmale> decides to go there  he walks in with no shoes, jeans, his t-shirt, and wild hair  the service has already started and so <propmale> starts down the aisle looking for a seat  the church is completely packed and he can't find a seat  by now, people are really looking a bit uncomfortable, but no one says anything  <propmale> gets closer and closer and closer to the pulpit, and when he realizes there are no seats,"
"he just squats down right on the carpet  by now the people are really uptight, and the tension in the air is thick  about this time, the minister realizes that from way at the back of the church, a deacon is slowly making his way toward <propmale>   now the deacon is in his eighties, has silver-gray hair, and a three-piece suit  a godly man, very elegant, very dignified, very courtly "
"he walks with a cane and, as he starts walking toward this boy, everyone is saying to themselves that you can't blame him for what he's going to do  how can you e playful ect a man of his age and of his background to understand some college kid on the floor? it takes a long time for the man to reach the boy  the church is utterly silent except for the clicking of the man's cane  all eyes are focused on him "
"you can't even hear anyone breathing  the minister can't even preach the sermon until the deacon does what he has to do  and now they see this elderly man drop his cane on the floor  with great difficulty, he lowers himself and sits down next to <propmale> and worships with him so he won't be alone  everyone chokes up with emotion "
