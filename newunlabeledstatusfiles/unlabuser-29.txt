tired   wants to go to sleep   
"no i'm not, i'm babysitting and i'm sleeping over at their house so i'm using there computer right now "
movies   
last night   soooo awesome!!!
so it's friday and i'm on the couch watching tv and then i see this lightning flash and then i look outside to see because i couldn't believe we had thunder and lightning and when i do i see this voltswagon silver bug ram into the electricity pole and there are sparks flying from the pole and then all of the lights start to flicker in the house and when i see this happen i scream holy shit!!!
and i immediately start to grab the phone to call 911 and this accident is right outside my house too but since the power went out the phone wouldn't work and my mom was at her work thing so i wait for the firefighters to come because people were already calling 911 and then me and <propfirst> start to smell this gas smell and <propfirst> yells its carbon monoxide we need to get out of here!!!!
and so me and <propfirst> run out of the house and once the firefighters show up we tell them about the smell and so they check it out and the car that was turned over had the drivers window on the side bashed out and a 50 to 60 year old woman climbs out of the passenger window because the car was on it's side and they take care of her
and then the firefighter that we talked to comes to the house to check it out and he's using this gas moniter thing to see the level of gas that's supposedly possibly building up and then they said that there's something funny going on because one of the other firefighters is saying that the smell is getting stronger each time they walk out for a few minutes
and then come back in so they ask us to stay out on the porch while they switch off the power box and so everything is shut down and a couple minutes later they say the smell's coming from the computer room and that some of the parts around the plug that the computer was plugged into were melted and that there's a little bit of smoke coming from it
so then they say that since my moms a ways away that they're going to have to drop us off with one of my friend's <propfemale>'s house and so they call her up and then we finally reach my mom and tell her the situation and she gives the go ahead  so they drop us off at <propfemale>'s house in the fire-engine and before we got there we had packed a few things in case we were going to stay overnight so we had those things too 
"and so now that we can't stay at our house because it's basically trashed right now, we are staying a little condo thingy hotel on my mom's work base  and she took us to the library and that's how i am able to be using the computer right now  phew! done!"
tomorrow is valentines day!!!! oh my gosh!!! i got the cutest stuff for <propfirst>!!!! he's going to soooo love it!!!!  laugh   laugh   laugh   laugh 
"babysitting two kids at one of my mom's friends' house  they are doing fine, watching the <propfemale> and the frog   awesome!!!!  laugh "

"went to the beach and then costco to eat delicious samples   got a slight tan at the beach, and at costco i saw amir from my 6th grade class (he's gotten stocky over the years) and i saw the basket lady (still hasn't changed one bit   i hope she dies alone   ) "
"tacos are delicious   however, why eat hard taco shells when all they do is give you a taco salad? why not just make a taco salad and save yourself the trouble of spilling the taco all over the floor? actually this could work to your advantage   if you for some reason wanted to order a taco salad at taco <propfemale>, just order hard shell tacos that are cheaper and break it up to make a taco salad!!! oh!!! i am smart!!!!  laugh "

we will always remember rocky   the japanese goldfish  we got him for christmas two years ago and this morning i found out he was dead  <propfirst> doesn't know because he's in his room playing on his crack but tink is at the store so she hasn't seen him yet  i found him stuck in the filter  when i pulled him out   he was dead   i will admit   it was really creepy 
daddy's home!!!! went to get some frogurt at tutie fruitie!!!! delish!!! ^-^ and we got a new fish to replace frosty  her name is summer and she's this metallicy shimmery gold color with a slight silver <propfemale>  she definitely stands out  it's perfect  ^-^
"well   this morning we couldn't find summer  actually tink had fed them and she saw her then  well we were looking and still couldn't find her  <propfirst> and dad were saying maybe <propfemale> ate her, but not i  i had a hunch that i knew where she was and i didn't like it one bit but i had to see if i was right  i told dad and <propfirst> \she's in the filter\"" \""dad she's in the filter\"" \""dad you need to take out the filter\"" """
after a little while he gave in and dismounted the filter  she wasn't in the holding compartment for the water so i knew she was in the tube  i asked <propfirst> to grab me a flashlight  after a while of looking in the tube i could've sworn there was something gold in there  i told dad she's in the tube  he looked and was laughing because he was pretty sure she was in there too 
"he went outside with the tube and started swinging it so that if she was in there, she would *shunk* on out  after a couple of swings, sure enough *shunk* out comes the fish   dead of course  and dad was laughing and i picked up the dead fish and flushed her down the toilet  when dad gets back we're going to shop for another summer and this time we're making sure it's bigger than the tube    < sad "
"got sunburned on the back of both legs as i had fallen asleep on my towel at la jolla beach  well, at least kyacking was good with tink    < smile "
