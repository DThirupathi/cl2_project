"i just wanted to share with you all lyrics from a song which i couldn't have written better myself to describe my life and the way i feel with a song  i have never been able to relate to a song even close to as much as i can this one  i also did a cover of it, video coming soon to youtube (will be multiple posts)"
"it seems like every dayâ€™s the same\and iâ€™m left to discover on my own\it seems like everything is gray\and thereâ€™s no color to behold\they say itâ€™s over and iâ€™m fine again, yeah\try to stay sober feels like iâ€™m dying here\\and i am aware now of how\everythingâ€™s gonna be fine one day\too late, iâ€™m in hell i am prepared now,\seems everyoneâ€™s gonna be fine\one day too late, just as well"
"i feel the dream in me e playful ire\\and thereâ€™s no one left to blame it on\\i hear you label me a liar\\â€˜cause i canâ€™t seem to get this through\\you say itâ€™s over, i can sigh again, yeah\\why try to stay sober when iâ€™m dying here\\and i am aware now of how\\everythingâ€™s gonna be fine one day\\too late, iâ€™m in hell\\i am prepared now,\\seems everyoneâ€™s gonna be fine\\one day too late; just as well"
"and iâ€™m not scared now \\i must assure you,\\youâ€™re never gonna get away\\and iâ€™m not scared now \\and iâ€™m not scared now  noâ€¦\\i am aware now of how\\everythingâ€™s gonna be fine one day\\too late, iâ€™m in hell\\i am prepared now\\seems everyoneâ€™s gonna be fine\\one day too late, just as well\\i am prepared now,\\seems everythingâ€™s gonna be fine for me"
"for me; for myself \\for me, for me, for myself\\for me, for me, for myself"
"what of the tides of the celestial abyss known as oblivion? to sail the waters of such is to know true pain  alas, i am in my fourth year at sea "
"most people have 1000 wishes for christmas; a cancer patient only has one,\to get better  i know 97% of you won't repost this to your status, but\my friends will be the 3% that do  in honor of someone who has died, or\is still fighting, or survived cancer, copy this to your status"
"what do you do when you lose part of yourself? when half of your heart and soul goes away  when everything that used to be good and satisfying in life has lost all of its appeal  when you look at all the amazing things you have around you, and realize that it all means nothing without that essential piece  when all you can do is stare into space, and fight back tears "
"when your life loses its light, and seems unworthy of living  if this piece of yourself was the only thing that kept you alive in the first place, for your life was already unworthy of living  there is only one thing you could do, and that is to wait for time to heal the wound, and fill the hole  i hope i can survive long enough to see that day "

"the depression is     so    strong     the pain is utterly unbearable  someone, something, please    make it stop "
"blind faith is foolish  having faith in the existence of an omnipotent being whom demands worship but refuses to show itself could be compared to having faith that an invisible pink unicorn wants you to bake cookies so it can make lazer beams fly from the chocolate chips and destroy fish a few <propmale> out from the philippines, or any other figment of your imagination speaking insane and equally irrelevant words to you"
