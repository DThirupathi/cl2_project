2011 i have big plans for you 
i can't sleep :  
things are starting to feel so differently lately : )
"today, i woke up with a smile "
i could get used to this : )
doing things around the house & i'm anxious for later : )
what a wonderful day  love 
i fear that i may be loosing confindence in myself already 
yeah last night's dream didn't help me what so ever  sad 
will be back on in a jiffy 
i'm feelin' way too damn good smile 
4 days left hurfuckingray : )
heading off to bed  only three full days left 
why are hands so difficult to draw?
last day of summer school! : )
doing stuff around the house and what not 
i have so much to do and i'm already tired 
cleaning around the house then spending time with <propmale> : )
great i have a poison <propfemale> bubble on one of my toes 
yeah i'm heading to bed very soon
you give me a basket case full of smiles  love 
going to wakefeild tonight  love 
waiting for tomorrow 
i hate how i get worried about every little thing when i know things are going perfectly fine 
honestly i feel pretty shitty 
so things are all worked out and i'm in such a better mood now : )
i actually enjoyed the movie kick- ass 
he completes me 
i feel so restless 
just got home from <propmale>'s house  now heading to bed 
doing yardwork 
"i never e playful ected that over a short period of time that i would feel so strongly for you like i do now, and even if the <propmale> keep us apart  i know that i don't want to lose you; you already mean the world to me "
invader zim on netflix then bed 
"taking care of my dad's mess, going to take a long walk, then heading home  oh by the way i miss you  love "
waiting for tomorrow

"feels like today's plans are up in the air, and having three full days of summer doesn't exactly help either "
going through my zune; cleaning out and adding new 
a spicy grilled chesse sandwhich with hot sauce? this tastes amazing!
the legend of <propfemale> soundtracks always sound so soothing to me 
is actually looking forward to tomorrow

today would have been better if it wasn't so hot outside 
i think i'll just head to bed then 
people are ridiculous 
just got back from a wonderful time with <propmale>( :
playing some legend of <propfemale> ocarina of time like a boss

"i have all these thoughts running through my head; and to be honest, it's quite overwhelming "
"today was not a good day for me, just saying "
"honestly, i don`t  think i  have ever been as happy as i am now : )"
