"if you have a man\that works hard to take care of you, would do anything for you, that\makes you laugh, that's your best friend, who you want to grow old\with, who is your world, and someone that you're thankful for every\night - then post this as your status to give the good men out there\the recognition they deserve      because great men are few and far\between     and i have one!"
