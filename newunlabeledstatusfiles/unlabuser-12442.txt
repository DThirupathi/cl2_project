man vs  machine: man-1 machine-0  game highlights --> man starts the game with a simple brake pad job  everything is going smooth then machine snaps bolt  man finagles the snapped hardware out  caliper is removed and leaky piston is discovered  man replaces caliper and makes another trip to parts store    time is running short     caliper is installed and with the help of some friends the brakes are bled  man wins!!!
