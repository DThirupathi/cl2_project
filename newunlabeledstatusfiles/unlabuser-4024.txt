it's tattoo day muthafuckas!!!!!!!!!
omg i feel like shit!!!!!!
so ready for bed   really need to clean the chevy but i'm thinking a nap is in order before i do  not sure what to do tonight   might head to the drag strip 
fuck it nap wins
it's just one of those days
gonna be a long weekend  but atleast it will be a money filled weekend 
didn't get the truck cleaned   gonna have to do that in the morning now  hopefully this night at work goes quick but i doubt it 
finally headed home from work  hopefully there is food at the house cause i'm fucking starving like those children on the tv commercials 
well i would call tonight a success!!!
if it hadn't been for a few select people work would have been really shitty tonight 
really hope this night goes by quick and easy   not in the mood to deal with shit today 
anyone up for a late movie tonight?
4 hours down 12 to go 
had the <propmale> to go home instead if stay over   chose to stay and work  why do i always let money control me   oh that's right it's because i'd rather be controlled by money than a female  lol
it's just one of those days
