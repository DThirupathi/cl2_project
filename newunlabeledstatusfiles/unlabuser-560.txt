"if you have my cell phone number plz send me a text mgs with your name  why you ask, well   the trouble started when i decided to clean my room  (i know, big mistake)  the next morning i looked all over for my phone, but couldnâ€™t find it  my mom used a tracking system and found it in seaside  she searched for it again, and it was on the move! so my mom and bro (i was at a friendâ€™s party) took off in hot pursuit!"
"the phone stopped in castorville and was about 30 minutes behind it   they were determined going to find it! then they arrived at the last known location and discovered they had arrived at the recycle facility! yes, thatâ€™s right; my phone fell into the recycle bin when i took the trash and empty boxes outside  the moral of this story: never clean your room on trash recycle day!"
