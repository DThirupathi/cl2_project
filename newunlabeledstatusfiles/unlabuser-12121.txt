it's kinda sad when you don't want to lose a person as a friend but you need to get rid of their certain behavior    it's ends up getting you mad and hurting that person when you truly don't want that but then again it's also gets you relieved to get rid of them   so what's a person to do nowadays stay friends an tolerate how they act towards you or get rid of them and lose a friend?

 sad  just breathing
it's so funny how people try to prove how they have so much love in their relationship and that they even know what it is yet more than even half of those people have no idea what they're claiming because they're too blinded by the attraction and lust they're getting
to even realize that love is something no one person actually knows and even if they do it always changes like a little childs mind unless you are certain you are mature enough to handle it then congrats you know more than me than her than him and definitely anyone my age     i bored lmao
trust me i'll never let this go but i can't find the words to tell you cuz idw to be alone but now i feel like idk you

wow smh <propfemale> grabbed a retarded guys penis
the past is the past for a reason  and if someone in the past was meant to be in your present or future they would have fought harder for it 
"â€œthere comes a time in many peopleâ€™s lives where you have to let go of the person that is closest to you  if your best friend is making you miserable the friendship you have with that person isnâ€™t healthy  an unhealthy friendship can really damage your state of mind and your own personal health  even though you donâ€™t want to lose him her, it may be best for your own sanity to cut ties â€�"
is it that damn hard to ask to just let go of the past and atleast make an even better future together
"there can be more than one â€™special oneâ€™ in a lifetime  even if somebody is as a soul mate to you, it doesnâ€™t mean that person is supposed to be at your side forever in this lifetime  people come and go in our lives  some stay a short while, some stay longer, some stay forever  each has a purpose  an influence  the amount of time together doesnâ€™t determine the quality or depth of the relationship "
i find it funny how people have a tendency to block me a lot and then never bother to say hey i hate you at least lmaoo
teenagers are stupid and full of stupid emotions they can't suppress that is why i hate being a teenager it's a waist of my life but at least i'm able to realize the difference between true feelings and teenage randomness unlike others

"so if a deodorant doesn't say for men anywhere, and looks pretty feminine, i'm sure anyone can conclude for women right? unless otherwise stated  well, reason i bring it up is because for some reason my father seems to have more feminine deodorant than i do    he probably just likes the scent of gaiety and the nostalgia of rainbows with little leprechauns at the end"
"what's the difference between bawling and balling you ask? well bawling is crying and balling is what you do when you're in the hood smackin' around your ho's  so please everyone at-least make the effort to get things grammatically correct because i interpret things differently and if you say \i was ballin cuz my bf left me\"" i will laugh at you """

"when i go to college my <propmale> is going to be lady gaga why you ask well because i want to spend $21,000 in a class dedicated to the life of <propfemale> g  and learn about the sociology of the rise of fame that gaga has acquired then i will apply that to my life,and do nothing worth of anything b c i want to be lazy with no skills and no job, stressing the life out of me because i have to pay that stupid student loan-_-"
but i gotta admit lady gaga has fun music lately its becoming quite weird lol buuttt regardless its good but only for like a week cuz like i would listen to it and love it then a week later its just a gaga song but i will never in my damn life waste money to take a college class!!!!!! about lady gaga like what is that man!
"what place do you think that tradition has in society (if any)?        \well i think it has a <propmale> influence especially in the way people e playful ect things and act towards each other"
"how do you feel when you are working with someone who is very organised?\i feel at ease, b c if they are organized i feel compelled to do the same and when i am actually organized my life is just so much more neater lol"
"how do you like to spend your spare time?\umm i like to spend my spare time talking with my few friends or walking i dont like <propmale> things it makes me feel out of place"
"in what situations are you c surprise perative? when do you enjoy competition?\ uh almost all situations i am which sucks about me but i hate competition i feel like if there is ever a need for me to ever compete for something then its not worth it  i either deserve it or not, and i agree for fighting for something or someone but competing for something or someone i feel is just unnecessary and a waste of my life"
"which situations make you feel under pressure and which situations do not?\i think the situations that e playful ect me to change in some kind of aspect like my personality or just my strange way of thinking  also things that e playful ect me to react out of my element like getting angry or fighting unless it has to do with a certain some1 that i cant stand      but besides those things almost nothing b c of how laid back i am"
"yo my ninjas i really love <propfemale> netrebko, shes soooo amazing i love her voice!!!!!!!!!!!!"
the one thing i hate seeing on a girls face is a piercing and i'm sorry if you qualify for this  but if you're a girl and not only that but you are gorgeous what in your damn mind told you it was okay to pierce your damn face!!!
"and also adding to my last post   i'm not lesbian or anything like that okay ppl but i do acknowledge when i see a pretty or gorgeous girl cuz i'm not blind either anyway and i hate when i see a girl and her face is <propfemale> pretty but no something in her head told her that the piercing on her lip, eyebrow, nose, cheek, upper lip, <propfemale>, and even forehead was okay  and yes that is the complaint topic of today"
like omg seriously do you not have any damn respect for yourself and your dignity especially if you're pretty to pierce your own face like it gets to me dammit and i do admit some girls look better with piercings sometimes but if you are truly pretty like omg even straight girls(likeme) have to admit you're pretty then please give me an e playful lanation to the damn hole and metal object in your face -__-
