"people think that a liar gains a victory over his victim  what i've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that persons view requires to be faked "
"a man is never drunk if he can lay on the floor without holding on \-<propfirst> e  <propfirst>"

"â€œwe are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not  otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind's door at 4am of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends  we forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget â€� - <propfirst> didion"
