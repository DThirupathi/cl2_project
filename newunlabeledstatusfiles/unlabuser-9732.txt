"a true friend doesn't care if you're broke, you're slightly mental at times, you can't keep a secret, your house is a mess, or your family is filled with crazies   they love you for who you are  true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship  re-post if you are lucky enough to have at least one true friend"

"how far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong  because someday in life you will have been all of these "

"tough girls come from new york  sweetgirls, they're from alabama  but minnesota girls, we have fire and ice in our blood  we can ride four-wheelers, be a debutante, throw left hooks, and hunt with the boys, all while wearing shorts and winter coats in the same week! and lord knows if we have an opinion, you are going to hear it! repost if you're a true minnesota girl  ? ? *this is totally true!!  smile *"
"learn to get in touch with silence within yourself, and know that everything in this life has purpose  there are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from"

you will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love

never knowing who you can truly trust is so frustrating at times   but i guess if you listen to your gut you can't go wrong   if the signs are there of someone being untrustworthy pay attention to them
