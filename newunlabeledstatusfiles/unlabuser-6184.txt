sooo   i have spent months and months upset that i fried my good computer and finally got the pats to rebuild it    guys here putting it together when we find out that the only thing that was actually wrong with the computer was that it needed a new power button   
for those who know whats been going on great news  its not cancer  i dont think i can honestly say how happy i am here because words cant describe  but thank god  the worst and scariest week and a half of my life is over
so bored with wow i am logging off to wash the walls in the living room
sooo tired think im going to pass out for the next 2 days
"soo  first guy i paid to work on rebuilding my comp installed everything wrong, broke it all in the process and now is unreachable   "
"sooo again i am being told i will have my new \computer tonight    we will see how that goes"
