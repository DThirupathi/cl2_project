attention:itwas brought my attention that the group asking everyone to change theirprofile picture to a cartoon character is actually a group of pedophiles  there doing it because kidswill accept their friend request faster if they see a cartoon picture  it has nothing to do with any child charities  it's on tonights news    so change your picture back please 
wish i knew why people act the way they did
