"looking forward to going to sleep in a few minutes  first week of the second semester was fun, much less stress than last semester  must finish this movie first though  crying "
"home with just the kitties, waiting for a response from a friend  about to go to sleep "
playing city of heroes with <propfemale>  irritated at lack of other members on the team  also waiting on two friends to get their behinds over here  they were supposed to be here hours ago >>

"hates his phone for hating his friends  too bad my bow's broken, or i'd use it as target practice "
