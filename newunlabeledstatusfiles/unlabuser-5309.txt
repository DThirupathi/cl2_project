everyone change your profile pictures back to yourself because the group that told us all to change our pictures to our favorite cartoon characters were a group of pedophiles  they were doing it because kids would accept their friend requests faster if they saw a cartoon picture    it has absolutely nothing to do with supporting child violence  (watch the news tonight and pass it on)
