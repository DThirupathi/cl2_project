"~say it once say it twice, take a <propmale> and roll the dice ride with the <propfemale> in the dead of night~"
things need to start changing   or else im not sure whats gonna happen
"look at what i made for you, it was never enough and the world is what i gave to you \i used to be love struck; now i'm just fucked up!"
"the ultimate measure of a person is not where they stand in moments of comfort and convenience, but where the stand in times of challenge and controversy "
in three words i can sum up everything i've learned about life: it goes on 
"almost got killed today, fuckin dipshits on the 98!  annoyed  god i swear today was not a day to drive anywhere be it on the 98 or in town uughh!!!!"
"if the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loveing them  buildings burn, people die  but real love is forever -the crow"
"let it slide, let your troubles fall behind you, let it shine, until you feel it all around you and i don't mind if it's me you need to turn to  we'll get by, its the heart that really matters in the end "
turn the lights down low and let the dj go until the speakers blow stay up til the break of <propfemale>!
if your going to get fucking burned at least have the fire be hott! ;p
"i fallow the night, cant stand the light  when will i begin to live again? one day ill fly away leave all of this to yesterday, what more could your love do for me? when will love be through with me? why live life from dream to dream? and dread the days when dreaming ends"

"suppose death had a heart to love and to release you, to whom would he turn this passion, would you chose a person from the crowd there  a person to suffer as you suffer "
"people once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead  but sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest  then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right"
some people are just born with tragedy in their blood
~the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return ~
"you'd better believe it's right rock now, rock the night! til' early in the morning light"
"blue masquerade, strangers look on when will they learn this loneliness? temptation heat beats like a drum deep in your veins, i will not lie"
everyone has their secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call them cold when they are only sad 
"there comes a point in your life when you realize that nothing will ever be the same, and you realize that from now on time will be divided into two parts- before this and after this "
all the love in the world cant be gone all the need to be loved cant be wrong
you can only kick someone down so much till they wont get up anymore   but when i get up your gonna wish i stayed down   
if you find someone that you know you love  just love that person

"life doesn't hurt until you think about how much things have changed, who you've lost along the way, and how much of it was your fault "

"\i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me\"" much ado about nothing lol great play movie gotta love shakespeare"""
"to live in this world you must be able to do three things: to love what is mortal; to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it; and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go  -blackwater woods-"

~shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on  the loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude ~
"if your mum is a hard working woman and is your hero, helped you no matter how bad you were or was just the best mother ever, if you are blessed to still have your mother or if she is an angel up in heaven, paste this to your status and let everybody know your proud of your mum  you can replace a lot of people in life but you can never replace your mum ? love you mum xox"
~success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome ~
"~we use our eyes to look for love,but real love is already floating in the air around us  we just have to believe that it actually exists ~"
~sometimes nothing can stop a heart from breaking when love leaves ~
