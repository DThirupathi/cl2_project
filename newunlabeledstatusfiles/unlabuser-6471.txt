"it's like you're deaf to my voice, but i've been here for every moment, waiting on your call to move \if you could just make a choice, i know you would find me wanting only to be close to you "

"by far the most \happy birthday's\"" i've ever been told  playful  thank you all  smile """
"working until the 8th  annoyed  <propfemale>, you should txt me  wink "
"the earth moves and you find me, alive but unworthy broken and empty, but you don't care because you are my rapture, you are my savior when all my hope is gone, i reach for you, you are my rescue "
would you be an outlaw for my love 
"iâ€™m at war with the world cause i, ainâ€™t never \gonna sell my soul  iâ€™ve  already made up my mind, no matter what i \canâ€™t be bought or sold  when  my faith is getting weak, and i feel like\ giving in, you breathe  into me again "
let's pause time 
the mindless are easily lured 
"love is patient, love is kind  it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud  it is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs  love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth  it always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres   - 1 corinthians 13:4"
"\you didn't see those sweet graphics of fire?\"""""

"he is jealous for me \love's like a hurricane,\i am a tree \bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy \when all of a sudden, i am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by \<propfemale>, and i realize just how beautiful you are and how great your affections \are for me "

"she lives in a <propfemale> tale, somewhere too far for us to find \forgotten the taste and smell, of the world that she's left behind \it's all about the e playful osure, the lens, i told her \the angles were all wrong now \she's ripping wings off of butterflies \keep your feet on the ground, when your head's in the clouds "
a positive attitude lifts us above our circumstances and enables us to have peace in the midst of the storm and to have joy when there is no visible reason to rejoice 
i want to play tennis so bad! love 
sitting at a stoplight isn't so bad when you get to watch the person behind you dance to thriller  playful 
is it just me or do you ever feel like you're the only person in the world that knows how to put the paper towels toilet paper on the holder the right way?  
"dear pain, oh, it's been a long time, remember when you were holding me tight, i would stay awake with you all night \dear shame, i was safe in your arms, you were there when it all fell apart \i would get so lost in your beautiful lies \i let you go \but you're still chasing "
"our god is greater, our god is stronger, god you are higher than any other, our god is healer, awesome in power, our god, our god \and if our god is for us, then who could ever stop us, and if our god is with us, then what could stand against "
"those that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint  -<propmale> 40 smile 1"
"and when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile, cause you're amazing, just the way you are "

"arise and be all that you dreamed, all that you dream "
"arise, shine, for your light has come, and the <propfemale> of the lord rises upon you \see, darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but the lord rises upon you and his <propfemale> appears over you  - <propmale> 60:1-2"
"i whisper in your ear, the words you want to hear \you feel the wind and it reminds you \it happens everytime, you stop and close your eyes \you can't deny what lives inside you \well i know it's hard to see, what is meant to be \when yesterday is so far behind you \deep inside your soul knows i'm always there "
"wake up, o sleeper, rise from the dead, and christ will shine on you  -ephesians 5:14"
look past the circumstance and find some meaning 
those who live in the shelter of the most high will find rest in the shadow of the almighty  -psalm 91:1

"dear tx drivers,\\apart from you being able to figure out a way to hydroplane in a drop of rain  \i'd appreciate it if you would learn how to drive so you would stop hitting me "
