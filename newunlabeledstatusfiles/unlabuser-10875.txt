"i really don't want to go to work today, i'd much rather go smoke a cigar "
"had a great night, tomorrow i better find something to do "
why do the fun parties always happen on random days?
life has just become so boring as of late

"\i heard you bitches wanted to play some wiffleball \"""""
"j-bones throws one amazing party, can't wait for tomorrow  thanks to everyone that came and made it so awesome "
i've seen what i have done and the world i have created and built around me  yet the only thing i would ever change is myself 
is gonna go lose himself in a good graphic novel to drown out the world around me 
"gonna <propfemale> with mr  ball eventually, or i'll kill him "
loves talking with old friends about his band geek days  thanks <propfirst> 
"i am a bad person, i've done bad things  but i'll be damned if i let a friend suffer "
ah work you ruined what looked to be an eventful evening  oh well you'll be gone soon and i will be on to bigger better things  or atleast a bigger pay check 
"going to court, this should be fun "
"i made a judge laugh, i don't know if i should be happy that i made a man of the law chuckle or ashamed cause i was in court for something so stupid  o well chalk this one up as another story "

"i missed when i could just go get some late night eats at <propfirst> in the box without being pulled over, everyone freaking out, and getting weed dumped all over my food to hide it  plus that pretty much ruined everyones night and i feel bad  it even ruined mighty ducks  sad "
"pandorum or surrogates, it's up to a vote "
