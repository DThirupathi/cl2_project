i'm doomed  never even started my paper  english starts in 30 minutes  and i'm on facebook instead of working on it 
"just got off work, going back at 5  hittin' up one of them \spookhouses\"" tonight   smile """
"i'm trying  real hard  i promise  but i really, really, really   hate essays "
still working (but not really working) on this stupidstupidstupid paper  class starts in two hours soo   hmm  i got this 
i just used the restroom at school for the first time   it was probably the grossest moment of my life  our foamy soap is the freakin' shit though 
why in the world did i sign up for a morning class? this is exactly why i failed so many classes in high school: too early  sooo freaking tired 
"super excited for <propfemale> <propfirst> burgess's birthday, hopin' to make it a good one for her  this week has <propfemale> fast though  being with him makes time kinda   fly love "
"workin' till 4, then hopefully getting started on this stupid paper  psh, i'd rather stay at work "
"so, i'm very excited for my computer to be working normally, thanks to cody love  and other various ppl who helped him  time for beddd "
just kicked some ice cream machine butt  i  love  my neopet
so i'm pretty positive that my car isn't even going to make it to the gas station  i guess i'm spendin' the night at school  ugh 
meet me at the church 
"if i were an elephant, i would shoot peanuts at ppl from my trunk all daaay "
"wide awake, doin the ice cream and cake  ahh shit i need to get to bed "
"work tonight, and tomorrow night  excited to be off thursday and see my  love family "
"has been thinking about christmas gift ideas for the past six hours, and has come up with absolutely nothing "
"need to go to bed soon, work at 8 in the morning  and of course, i'm wide awake  i think i came close to overdosing on coffee today "
"heading to work, 11 smile 0 to 8  have a lot i need to get done this week but, keep putting it off as usual  family christmas party this weekend, should be pretty fun   love "
"is in a ridiculously bad mood  hey, do me a favor   stop talking, k? thanks "
"today, my sister was grounded for a week for logging onto my mom's farmville and buying a tractor without her permission  mlia   (lol)"
is going bumpersticker crazyy 
"can't sleep, at all  10pm coffee is starting to look like a bad idea  wow, what a nice day off  yeah just kidding it completely sucked ass from the moment i woke up "
"startin' my day off right: big cup of coffee, hot shower, good attitude  work at 11  hopefully i can stay busy, not get bored, get my mind off yesterday  horrible, horrible yesterday  not long before *new year's* and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun  "
i'm a lesbian
really want to take a nap before work but i'm gonna try to avoid it  i need to work on not sleeping 12 hours a day   ughh 
"is about to hit the sackk  work in the mornin', not looking forward to waking up to the cold, but had two pretty good days off  had a lot of fun today with <propfirst>, <propfemale> and matty "
i want to watch the hangover  right now 
i think we might die if we try to drive to indy today  so much for dave&bustersss 
"it really sickens me when someone makes their every single status  about their significant other  (especially when you've been together for like, 2 weeks ) like, really? do you have a life away from eachother? well get one "
brushing your teeth with strangers is awkward  i wish they had separate little stalls for teeth-brushing at the orthodontist 
i miss my frienddds  i never see any of them anymore  or talk to them  and my family too  actually   my family especially  what happened to my social life? i mean dang   annoyed 
tonight seems so   quiet  and it's driving me insane 
can't sleep  this is lame  time for a little driiive 
ughhhh  myspace annoyed aame  spent all day editing my profile  now i might just delete iit 
"hmm, idk   let's just google it   smile "
i'm loving this thunderstorm  especially since i have nothing better to do today than work 10 and a half hours   smile 
"if you were to play a game with the devil, do you really think he'd let you go first?"
"walking to my first class, late   and my pants are on backwards  fml "
"thank you everyone, i had a great birthday with some wonderful people of mine  the big 2-ohh   smile   and it even continued into today (picnic with my babe, thank you honeyy) "
"i probably should've been more productive with my two days off  oh well  got to see my cal gal finally, and spend some time with family  bargain shopping with codyy was fun too  back to worrk in the mornin  yaayy   annoyed "
it feels like so much has changed in one day   and not much really even happened today  maybe it's just that most days we try too hard to make things change  
"no time like the present? haaa, yeah well  i more of a \there's always tomorrow\"" type of gal """
wishin i could stay home and watch the hangover with my mama  i miss having sundays off 
i'm not going to vaccuum until sears makes one you can ride on 
"with the help of rice, tweezers, a thermometer, and a vaccuum   my new droid is back in action after its near-death e playful erience "
"excited for my mission with @<propfemale> needler tomorrow, but really missing my family too  i just don't see enough of them anymore  at least thanksgiving is comin up real quick so i'll get to see the whole bunch of them "
