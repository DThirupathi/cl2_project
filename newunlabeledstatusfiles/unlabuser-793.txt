is off to work  for my bff's sake i hope the saints win today! who dat!
is sad the saints lost   sad 
truly enjoys the joy of hiding out all day  why is it that most people don't enjoy this kinda stuff? the idea of chilling out in the pjs all day and reading all day is one of the best plans for a day in my world   the only thing that might make this day better is to have three or four of these kinda days in a row    smile 
has spent the majority of the day reading  i have to say it has been a nice distraction  especially since i have had a lot of things on my mind lately 
hates it when people play with others feelings   i just wish i could be as cold hearted and uncaring as others are instead of overly tender hearted 
is off to bed   gonna watch some of the fellowship of the ring and then catch some z's  gotta work tomorrow night which kinda sucks though   good night all and sweet dreams 
"is getting ready to head off to triple e   i know its gonna be dead as you can get, but i hope we get done early and i can come home and read some more of this true blood fan fic story i'm reading "

"just wants to kick her personal demons in the teeth    yeah they may by sharp and pointed and might hurt like hell, but they are absolutely destroying me from the inside out and i am just about sick and tired of feeling this way! i know    its my fault that i feel this way, but after dealing with them for so many years you would think i would eventually come to terms with them "
"hates having to be an actress  i know in my line of work you have to, but when you have to start acting in your everyday life, it is truly hard to deal with  especially when you have all these things that are on your mind constantly and all you want to do is scream, but you just hope that others can't see through all the masks you have created to hide all the personal demons you have in your heart  complex isn't it?"
sleep would truly be a glorious thing    too much on my mind  so much to write and i can't seem to get myself organized   i haven't felt this inspired in months   i really should be sleeping though 
"just got back from the fish co   had lots of fun with mom, <propfemale>, and <propfirst>   we gotta do that again sometime soon "

"is emo    yep, what's new there  i guess it shouldn't surprise me at all  i guess when you live in constant states of confusion it happens "

"is beyond angry with altell at this moment  i haven't had internet on my phone for over 24 hours and they really wouldn't give me a straight answer when i called today so i am going to their office before work, so they better hope that i have my phone fixed before then or they are going to see one very angry woman! on another note, the day was boring and work was too  guess i am going to read a bit then crash "

"is thinking that sleeping off this killer headache may be the best idea i have  especially with my anti-pain reliever ways  so if i'm not back around later, hope everyone has sweet dreams and i'll catch ya in the morning "
"is glad the killer headache is gone, though it seems that i have overslept and now feel funky  i guess that means a late night for me  the question of the day now is, what to do with myself? i do have a couple of ideas though   smile "

"feels lonely    <propfemale> is gone to a play with friends, the twin is working    what am i gonna do?!?!"

's ac has died at home   sad 
is hoping that when the people come to take my ac to be fixed they bring a spare to put in  off to work     sad 
thinks the powers that be hate me   sad 
is sitting out in the backyard trying to avoid the heat of my house! its 90 degrees in there!!!

omg!!! true blood was all kinds of awesome! lots was revealed and a yummy viking flashback! can't wait till next week to find out what happens!!! squee!!!
"is finally going to bed  i've been rereading a book, when i should be reading linger but its a dangerous thing to read new stuff this late at night  hope all have or had sweet dreams  night "
"is having one of those days in which i just want to hide and have limited contact with the world, but work is gonna force me out into the public! i curse you job!"
really thinks that it would have been safer for me to stay home tonight than going to work  people that you want to forget tend to pop up when you least e playful ect them and you want nothing more than to cause them physical harm or run for cover 
is really tired  so i guess i'm off to bed  sweet dreams to all 
"is still sleepy but i'm off to work  the inner history geek in me is sharing my tidbit of history i gained from the history channel fb <propfemale>  confederate general <propfirst> hood attacks union forces under general <propfirst> t  <propmale> outside atlanta in 1864 and in 1969 <propmale> armstrong and <propmale> \buzz\"" aldrin become the first men to walk on the <propfemale> """

"really enjoyed today    read a book and started another, had lunch in carbondale along with going to barnes & <propmale>, visited with aunt <propfemale>, and had some yummy fish  too bad i have to go back to work tomorrow  so, i'm off to bed to dreams some nice dreams  good night "

i curse you job! you are taking me away from my true blood tonight when it appears that the episode is gonna be freaking awesome! all i can say to the eee crew is they better get their rears in gear cause we're gonna get out of there asap!!!!
"has to say that tonights episode of true blood was freaking awesome! still too many unanswered questions i want answered! needed more <propfirst>! anyway, i'm off to bed, so sweet dreams to all "
"had a nice day with friends, and enjoyed some much needed quiet time around the house  finished reading a couple of books, and looking forward to starting the girl with the dragon tattoo after getting off work  i'm off to bed though  sweet dreams to all "
is headed off to work  needing to make some $$$  after work i guess me and mom are going to dinner somewhere  then i'm starting my new book!

"is thinking about trying to go to bed, though i don't know how well that will work out for me since i had the nap earlier  also, i'm about five chapters in my book and i have to say it is a very interesting read, something that isn't in my normal reading genre  i am looking forward to finishing it tomorrow and starting the next book in the series  until tomorrow facebook friends    good night and sweet dreams "

thinks that today was pretty okay  nothing dramatic happened  i've been a little tired but i think its due to reading so much last night  i am about 100 pages into the girl who played with fire and i'll read more tomorrow  off to watch me some true blood 
wishes that there was a way to make money while reading books    i'd be <propmale> if that was the case

is extremely tired! i need sleep! my body aches and mom's in my room playing nintendo! i don't even want to read! (scary right?!) so i guess i'm gonna hide somewhere till she's done  good night all 
"dear saturday,\i know many don't work today, but i do so    no funny business! nice and quiet day please   smile \thanks "
"really can't believe that its been a year since i finished written in the stars  it still feels like yesterday when i started it  i think a year hiatus is good enough, though i'm not returning to fic, its time to start working on some original stuff "

"done with work, now to get my book  the only thing that would make this day better would be that my yard work would be done when i got home   annoyed "
mom's not here so i'm rocking out to some good '90s music and dancing around the house   smile 
"so    i got my book, however i'm too sleepy to read it now  guess i'll start it tomorrow after i get home from work  in the morning i guess i'm gonna try and finish my yard work before work  why do i have this feeling i'll be exhausted by tomorrow night?"
"hates when things you've done in the past haunts your present  i may not regret what happened, but when you're left without answers its hard to move forward with ones life "

"always remember the babies born asleep or the ones we have carried but never met, those we have held but couldn't take home or the ones who made it home but didn't stay  make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby  the majority of you wont bc unlike cancer, baby loss is still a taboo subject  break the silence   in memory of all of the lost angels!"
