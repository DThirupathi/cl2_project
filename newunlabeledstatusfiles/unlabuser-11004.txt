my phone broke again    it makes me sad   
damn    running out of dandelions   
i accidently left my ipod on for the past 24 hours    it's not even in the red on battery  these things are amazing  i want a cell phone with batterylife like this 
holy christ    it actually snowed    i thought it was impossible   
did anyone else see the people walking on the highway and just think 'hey! i want to do that!'
i'm wondering if hell has frozen over because i assumed they'd get snow around the same time we did 
"alright  can anyone involved in sprachfest that are missing anything from school text me (210-542-2837) what you are missing and where it is? i think we're screwed on puppets  we'll have to make something for backup  in regards to polka band and classical ensemble,"
"if nothing else, i had my first snowball fight today  my dad is still really 12  it was a blast though  that made everything good  joyful "
"huzzah! the brandeis <propmale> team got 2nd overall, our polka band got first, as did our upper level puppet show while our folk dance and classical esnemble both placed third  we recieved numerous other top five posistions, and almost all of our members will be moving onto state in <propfirst> on februrary 26th  yay brandeis!"
this phone actually works with facebook! it's crazy! although it'll take some adjusting 
"i hate the concept of even leaving my house right now, much less going to school "
my cat is glaring at me every time i cough   
damn childproof lids   
"i hadn't been coughing for two hours  as i'm getting ready to leave for a band concert, guess what starts up again? damnit "
"i hate being sick  i probably should've just stayed home today (<propfirst>, this does give you full rights to say you told me so )  i probably will stay home tomorrow "
my dad loves me  he made me hot chocolate from scratch 
the only nice thing about staying home is watching old cartoons  i like old cartoons 
i give up on drinking cold water until i stop coughing entirely 
i have to wonder if somewhere in the world there's some poor one-legged waitress working at an ihop 
yeah    i'm definitely not doing the columnist project at this point  although <propfirst> o rourke is still a badass 
alright  i dislike the english version of 99 red balloons  especially because it has <propmale> mixed in but the guy says it all weird 
this memorization isn't so bad 
"in soviet russia, nemo find you!"
i wish i had a gps that spoke to me in <propfirst> <propmale>'s voice 
why is it my animals decide they love me and want to <propfemale> all over me on a day i don't feel like sitting around?
"well i'm less than thrilled at the moment  sundays, huh?"
"just get some ice from the snow cone machine and some paper towels, make sure you put that eye on ice "
wisdom teeth suck!
?
<propmale> state competition tomorrow!
taking a look at sprachfest for next year    my god there's a lot to be done   
first rule of someone trying to get out of a hole that they've dug for themselves? to stop digging 
"you might be awesome, but you're not jesus high-fiving freakazoid on an escalator awesome "
my little cousin is wearing a bassoon shirt and thinks my new leopard geckos are cool  i'm so proud 
there is an app that tells you how to fix your bassoon reeds  there must be a god for something this amazing to exist 
yes! i found my ds! my night has been made!
"now, the question is do i just act based on more or less nothing in a fairly arbitrary fashion, or massively overthink and read too much into the situation?"
well at least someone found my total lack of historical and geographical knowledge amusing ^ _ ^
"just a note to all of you who haven't figured this out yet    google streetview, mapquest, ect  these things are not in real time  you cannot see the tsunami in japan on them  if you are dumb enough to actually attempt this    actually, you probably can't read this status  so nevermind "
it would be nothing short of ridiculous to wake up this early  but being up still? now that's another matter entirely 
and so it goes!
i feel so spazzy right now!
i saw a nun at work today 
damn you <propfirst> o'rourke! you and your lack of a wikipedia!
it's almost ask irksome as the word irksome 
"damn, facebook  you've failed me as a website "
"*sigh* looking back on it, chucking my laptop cable across the room probably wasn't the best of ideas "
to hell with the letter q!
genitals  enough said 
i just saw sharktopus for sale at bestbuy 
<propfirst> sheen is an incredibly disturbed individual    he's so full of himself it's comical   
i met a south african fellow yesterday!
"\    i will come down on this hospital like the hammer of thor \"""""
