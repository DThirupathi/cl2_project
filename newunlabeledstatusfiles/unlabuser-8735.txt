"â€œa silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means  this is an obvious lie  only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is    a man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later  that is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness  they have lived a sheltered life by always giving in â€� - c s  <propfirst>"
"â€œplease don't lie to me, unless you're absolutely sure i'll never find out the truth â€� - <propfemale> brilliant"

â€œthe greatest ignorance is to reject something you know nothing aboutâ€�
"â€œwe cannot change our past  we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way  we cannot change the inevitable  the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude  i am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how i react to it  and so it is with you; we are in charge of our attitudes â€�- cs"
