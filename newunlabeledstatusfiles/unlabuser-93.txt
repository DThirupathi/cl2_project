i feel bad guys every time <propfirst> has called in the past couple of weeks iv mssed her call because im working i want to talk to her so very much but its hard for me to call and actually get a hold of her thats why she is usually the one that calls i just hope she dosnt feel that im ignoring her cause thats the last thing i would do 
my dad recently added me to the insurance for my car we knew it would go up but had no idea it would tripple im so stressed out right now cause we have no way we can pay that much so im going to try and finish my teamleader work book of about 300 pages tonight so i can get this promotion faster im just freaking out right now

so i went to work this morning at 9 and was scheduled to get off at 5 but since people decided they didn't want to show up i stayed until 9 its not that i don't mind the hours its just tiring working a 12 hr shift
before work today i went up to sprint to see about getting a phone with them i was approved and i found out that since i work with whataburger i get a 13% discount on my monthly <propmale> (cool right)     so sine i didn't have the money at the moment to get the phone i want they set me up with a free one for 30 days everything  will be unlimited except calls to and from landlines
i forgot to post this but orange night out was great last year we gave out 66 burgers so this year corporate was e playful ecting 99 but we blew them out of the water and gave around 299
i haven't felt this bad in a while now      i miss you <propfirst>

playing ddo i still can't believe they made it free
i really like the schedual they have me on for now 4 days on 3 off it will give me time to spend with <propfirst> when she gets back hopefully this week or next
so bored       im sad cause i have these next couple of days off from work but have nothing to do     a certain someone needs too hurry up and get home so i feel like going places on my days off 
"give a man a fish \and he will eat for a day    \ give a fish a man \and it will eat for weeks    "
were up at wal mart looking at hand soap and my dad asks me what flavor we should get
