today is one of those days i would like to scream and run away     hopefully after nap (if we ever get there) things will be better 
"well about to get the kids to bed after i fell down the stairs and really hurt my arm! of course had 3 kids laughing at the top saying go down the stairs again mommy!! then there was <propfemale> \mommy go down the stairs but be careful they are slippery!\"" as she is laughing     kids i tell ya!"""
i still really hurt from falling the other day this is killing me! the kids don't understand that mommy hurts on her arm so they keep touching or laying on it or what ever they are doing at the time and it just kills!

"finally done with my laundry, ran some errands today,  cleaned up all the toys and now just sitting here listening to music relaxing  smile "

"deadly terms used by a woman  (1) fine - this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are right & you need to shut up  (2) nothing - means something & u need to be worried  (3) go ahead - this is a dare not permission, do not do it  (4) whatever - is a woman's way of saying f**k you  (5) that's ok - she is thinking long & hard on how & when you will pay for your mistake  re-post if u agree"
