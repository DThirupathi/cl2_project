"i love naps    i can only take one every once in a while, but wow   it is awesome when i can   "
see    this is what happends when you get two broken naps in one day and then are up doing your mom's homework for her cause she can barely do 2 + 2 let alone find the interslope of a mathmatical equation and graph it     now i can't sleep!!!!
is presently starting to believe that i shlould have taken the red pill     i want to belive that there is no spoon   
you know how long it has been since i have devided fractions by fractions and by some mysterious unknown force the fact that you have to multiply that fraction the resipricle of the faction that is the denominator shot to the front of my brain & i was actually right    i must of had an awsome math teacher in highschool    blah!
is bewildered by the fact that i have done so much math in the last three days that i'm starting to find applicable life situtations that accout for implimenting algebraic equations so that i can graph them and get a better insight into their meaning    
you know you have done too much math tudoring to your moth when you are trying to use the substitution method to try and graph the inequality to figure out which school <propmale> to pay more on to try and pay them off faster     ----arggggggg
