only just got into facebook  still working on my profile and all that good stuff 
"did my sat's today  i thought it went well, e playful ect that i was 2 3 of the way through the essay before that section of the test ended - -"
"i haven't been on facebook much in the last few days  i've been spending all my time on call of duty: modern warfare 2, owning mad n00bs lolz"
"huge in gaming news: infinity <propmale> ceo and studio head and a iw co-founder have been fired for (according to what is known and some speculation) conspiring to switch publishers  their current publisher, activision obviously doesn't want to see their <propfemale> goose leave  wonder what'll happen to call of duty?"
"felt like an ass in gym today, just standing around cuz i definately can't play basketball   "
hate to screw up the 'a' i have in psychology but i don't think i'm going to do this damn paper   
"thanks guys  for some reason, it still won't let me change my birthday  i was born in '92, not '91 - -"
thanks everyone!  laugh 
 love  all you guys
"as though i didn't have enough crap in my life, i can now add the strong possiblity of having to move (houses) to the list "
"today has been an awesome day so far  that hypnotist show was the most funny thing in a long time and despite applying so late, got my umassd acceptance letter today  laugh "
yeah   i suck at coming up with things to put in peoples' yearbooks  fair warning 
what fine weather we are having on the morning of this special event - -
does anyone know what time the umassd orientation starts tomorrow? i was told 7 smile 0 in the morning but that'd mean we'd be there about   31 hours =o
now i'm having second thoughts about my <propmale> at umassd  i'm thinking psychology might be the better choice than computer science at the end   
"any future umassd people start reading that predictably irrational book? some pretty interesting useful stuff in there, actually "
"thanks umassd, way to make everything confusing as hell  i took my placement test on orientation day (which only knew about thanks to friends, nothing in the mail) so i couldn't make schedule then  yet when i get my requirement classes from you, you give me weird-ass classes for science and my <propmale>  you even chose my general elective  <propmale>, crafts, and popular objects? wth?"
so   anyone know anything about this umassd orientation coming up on the 28th or whenever it is? haven't gotten anything in the mail or my inbox about it   kinda like the first one  - 0
"ugh  i just got the syllabus from my english teacher  i see the word 'essay' way too many times  also, why does my teacher disallow me from talking about windmills on essay #2?"
"finally found an elective  i guess i'll be learning <propmale> every tues and thurs, lol"
"i have switched to using my real last name, 'da <propfemale>' for umass  how did i not notice the typo in my bio? it was something like: \i was in fact born in portuguese   \"" wtf?"""
looks like i'm moving to a house close to mt  <propfemale> church  i'm assuming it's a nice area  anyone live in the neighborhood?
"programming mid-term tomorrow \i'm fucked  laugh "
"inbox only: tell me something you've always wanted to tell me  it stays between me and you, then post it as your status and see what you get : )"
no interwebs until tuesday  sad 
5 days of almost constant lifting and moving crap  no internet xbl until tomorrow  can only use school computers   
"so   on my way to umass, as i entered dartmouth, i saw a strange fellow on the busy road, listening to his ipod, riding a horse in the rain  wtf?"
waiting for my mom to get home from work with my copy of black ops  probably not going to sleep for about   42 hours  class later today and wednesday  i'll survive  it's been done before 
<propmale> canceled for today  if only i'd get an email from my math teacher too   
"my big <propmale> test tomorrow is going to be fun  \ich bin geschraubt   "
oh yeahhh  finally got my liscense lol
"after a hospital visit, i found out that my chest pain was not heart related  it would have sucked if it was and i was dying or something  it would have been worse if i had to go on a diet "
