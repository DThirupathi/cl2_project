"was meant for another time and place, where butterflies escaped the possibility of being smashed against car windows "
my heart stopped pumping but my blood is still alive 
do you let signs tell you what to do?
i wish you'd never looked at me that way 
i like it all that way 
by the morning maybe we'll remember who i am   love 
doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
you were wild; where are you now?
"her hair was long, her foot was light, and her eyes were wild "
"whatever comes our way, you know i'm your girl 'til the end "
every time you leave it's too soon 
i like the sway in your hips plus the way that your lips come together when you're saying some shit 
you never call me by my name but i still want you

"so, she's got a soft spot for heels and spurs "
i sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet 
"dear as remembered kisses after death,  and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned  on lips that are for others; deep as love,  deep as first love, and wild with all regret "
some dreams are worse than the truth 
"well, nurses smile; when you've got iron veins you can't stain their pretty shoes "
"but your face, it just keeps haunting; sometimes it's all i see "
there's beauty in that pain  can you see it?
"well, her eyes, they're rubies and pearls  and she's not made like those other girls "
the sunshine bores the daylights out of me 
don't think about us 
use that fame 
"she showed me her dreams - crumbled up like leaves from holding on too tight, scattered in their shoebox coffin on the cardboard walls covered with butterflies "
thought i knew myself so well; all the dolls i had  took my leather off the shelf  your apocalypse was fab for a girl who couldn't choose between a shower or the bath 
"you're so full, of it "
and i got what i got all despite you  and i get what i get just to spite you 
dreamed that she was a cabaret singer in a burlesque show that involved dancing in large bowls of salmon mousse   possible future career?

you are so sweet & i am so alone   love 
can't stop 
someday some crazy son of a bitch is going to murder you 
you call it love; i call it a heart attack with a new sound 
we're so much stronger than anything they've ever taught us to fear 
"and, darling, we go a-drowning  down we go, away "
"you're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird "
"if i'm so evil, why are you satisfied?"
filthy glamorous 
"all we care about is runway models, cadillacs, and liquor bottles "
"that's all i have to offer, i'm the cheap version of what you need  i'm a liar, i cheat and i steal; it's all for me "
and i swear that i don't have a gun 
"tightlacing again  twenty-inch waist, here i come "

can't stand anything in this town 
the only place you'll wanna be is underneath my christmas tree 
i wish jeremie <propfirst> dukes didn't have to go back to work tomorrow 
"if you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me baby "
"i'd be satisfied, electrified to know a guy what takes his time "
"do you want this? say what you want  say what you mean  we could talk lung to closed ear, head inside a hand, turning over again together "
she's the second best killer i ever have seen 
come on join the bloodsport 
"wild child, full of grace, saviour of the human race "
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back 
goodbye babylon 
"he's so unreal, he's a mannequin - a synthetic, plastic, rubber man "
my baby's on the level 
"had a good workout  now, eating cake "
"no rest\without love,\no sleep\without dreams\of love--\be mad or chill\obsessed with angels\or machines,\the final wish\is love"
she's not broken; she's just a baby 
your love is nothing i can fight 
that awkward moment in winter when people complain about how pale they are and discuss the need to tan 
only difference between downtown & uptown is therapy & valium 
don't think i'll confess
"can't help myself, i'm in love   love "
is ordering jeremie <propfirst> dukes' <propfirst>'s gift   love  excited 
"just give in  don't give up, baby  open up your heart & your mind to me "

i got a brand new game i wanna lay on you 
"let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar, and take our sweet little time about it  let's have a ball, girl, and take our sweet little time about it"
"oh  baby, let's shake hands "
"keep my heart breaking in the dark, come & spend the night"
"she's stretched out on a long white table  well, she looks so good, so cold, so fair "
you are no hero but i'll lie 
"the most beautiful thing, besides everything else god created, must be the blood that's running through your blue veins "
has an addiction and its name is chocolate
"it's thinking of love   it's thinking of stabbing us to death  and leaving our bodies in the dumpster   that's a nice touch, stains in the night, whiskey and kisses for everyone "
"we live a cute life  soundfanatic  pants tigh-ter than plastic, <propfemale>, but we've got no money "
don't be a drag just be a <propfemale> 
"i'm on the right track, baby, i was born this way   love "
i loved her too long  don't love her too 
everything's cool as long as i'm getting thinner 
she can flip her hair  i can flip you off 
sometimes i breathe you in and i know you know 
"i am all alone, dear "
same dna 
"the lights are staying out but - no sweat, i've got aim like a <propmale> truck "
"i know that you would like, like to change me, make me softer to your voice like a baby "
i hate it when people talk or write in length about how ugly they are  no one else is thinking of you that way so why are you?
"what a world  christmas once a year, girl  that's 364 tears, girl  so when christmas finally comes & nobody's got a gun & you think it might be fun to <propfemale> around - think again, girl "
i was shocked to look up and see <propfemale> hayworth there in a place so seedy 
i'm leaving for the monster ball tomorrow! a lot to do before then   love 
i feel you in my heart 
"hair is set in curlers  ready to get some beauty sleep and wake up to red lipstick, black lace, and leather "
"i'm gonna drink my tears tonight  i'm gonna drink my tears and cry  'cause i know you love me, baby "
you taste just like glitter mixed with rock 'n' roll 
ich trag den namen monster 
i've seen the devil and it looks like that 
"some girls want to hold your hand and some girls like to pray  well, my girl takes her drinks with dust and <propmale> razor blades "
i love boobs 
"put your hands on me, <propfirst> f  kennedy "
and what i really want to do tonight is toughen you up 
don't be scared 
"jeremie <propfirst> dukes, he's got me like nobody   love "
i lost all memory of you and midnight 
could be a nail in my coffin and i don't need another one 
"boy, if that girl don't have e playful ensive tastes "
