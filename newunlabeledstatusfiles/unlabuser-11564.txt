people who still have feelings for their ex's but are dating someone new should save everyone the aggravation of having to put up with it  move on already!!!
if you live in a place where your time zone is ahead of someone else's time zone   does that mean you can see into the future?! with your only limitation being that their future is your present?! *wondering*
bowling at hallmark lanes  wonder who'll go!!!!
had an old friend come by and sorta make my day a lil bit better 
holy crap! i forgot what i was supposed to do for english tomorrow!
"everybody like's kung-fu fighting! watching \kung-fu panda\"" and omg i love it !!!"""
why must punishment be inflicted to know we're alive? is it the thrill of bypassing death? to know your next breath is not your last? i worry for the future of our people   
life's a rollercoaster ride     who's next in line?!
i dont wanna like him   and yet every corny thing he does is sweet in some way  how do i make this feeling go away!?!
"people tell me all the time that long distance relationships work  but seriously, do they really? why would you kid yourself over thinking that someone <propmale> away from you would be faithful? it's not like they see you  your only communication is through the phone or internet  as far as i see it, they never work  eventually someone will want more than the other person can or wants to give "
"just finish reading what people answered about me on that q&a thing   some really nice things and some kinda depressing things  then again, i dont have game when it comes to dating so it's not all that bad "

"liking someone is too much trouble   why can't things ever just stay the way they were back in grade school  where he's a boy, i'm a girl and childish fun is the only thing on our minds?"

"better start getting more active from here on  if a life is what i want  well, need i say more   "
i need to sell about $140 more for a fundrasier to go to corpus  thinkin about begging my teachers since my friends are broke   laugh !!!!!
things are not always what they seem  family giving me more than enough to shake my nerves 
feeling kinda weird and dreadful: i made a promise to trust someone on keeping a promise  it's been a long time since i trusted someone   maybe this one will be worth trusting 
stressing out from familial and scholastic issues  i can't do both like most people can  so stop askin more of me than i can give damnit! [i wish this stress would burn the fat i have  then he'll stop complaining so damn much 
"oka, so i love my family right now   smile    i won't stress myself too bad, you all know i wont do that  but it is better if i push myself harder than i normally do  i'll never lose sight of school and what it means, no amount of drama could ever undo that  hanging in by a couple of threads  oh and thank you mommy, auntie ger and uncle <propmale>  it helps   "
how do you stop a moth from being lured into the flame?

"2 things are irritating me right now: 1 creeps on myspace who look like pedophiles trying to add me, 2 people at school who live in drama and can't shut up"
who else got that nhs induction thing for tonight? don't feel like dressing up for this thing   
can't believe i is goin be 18 next week! damn  i don't feel like getting a life yet 
humans are so weak  is that what makes us so enlightening?
