"people need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness, so there is no cure, and it's not contagious  they only want what we all want, to be accepted  most of you probably won't copy and paste this  will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour? it's special education week, and    this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help and understanding "

"so i've got this $1 winning scratch off ticket   i won a free ticket     do i cash it in and get a new ticket, or hold onto it until i feel lucky????"
"while you scream at your woman, there's a man \wishing he could talk softly to her ear while you humiliate, offend and \insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how \wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he \could make love to her  while you make your women cry there's a man stealing\smiles from her   post this on your wall if you're against domestic \violence"
"okay- so today is the day i am cashing in my \winning ticket\"" ticket   let's see what i get this time!!!  a big winner would be nice!"""

"omg!!! i can't sleep    this itching is driving me nuts!!  guess i will give in and spend the $40 on the zanafel   i can't keep doing this!!!  everytime i check, i find more spots   i'm about ready to cut off my fingernails to keep from scratching myself raw!  i think i have 30+ spots on my right arm, and i can't count how many on my right leg, or the side of my neck   ughhhhhhhhhhh"
traded a used 2 slice toaster for a new electric griddle   perfect size for <propfirst> and i   i think i got the better end of that deal 
"only 2 new spots today      yay!!!!!!!!!!!!   and the others are starting to dry up   ahhhhhh\but  i have to get out there and cut grass again   oh no!!!!!  i am going to bathe in the caladryl lotion "
here we go again     early day tomorrow and i can't sleep   happens every time i need to go to sleep early   maybe i should just start taking a sleeping pill as soon as i get home the night before an early day   just a thought         
"hmmmmmmmmmm   maybe there is something to that zanfel  but for $35 an ounce there should be   most of the itching is gone!!! just that fast!!!  one spot on my wrist and the cluster under my chin(s) have a little tingle, but i am waiting to see the outcome   if this works, i will most definately use it after i cut grass every time just as a precaution   each tube contains 22 applications, and i used 3 tonight "
"okay    what else is going to happen around here??????  haven't been able to start the weed -eater for 3 weeks, and now the @#%#^# lawnmower won't start   i can't get it to prime   i guess i will have <propfirst> help me load it and take it to the small engine repair guy   this is crazy!!!"

"okay, so a week off, and no <propmale> man rescued me, so i guess back to work tomorrow   bummer!!!!   but it was a much needed week, and i accomplished most of what i set out to do   i might need another week when i go in and see what is waiting for me   lolbut i know <propfirst> did everything just right!!!  you go girl!"
"this\week, we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but \never met, or those we have held but could not take home   make this \your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a\baby  the majority won't do it, because, unlike cancer, baby loss \   is   still a taboo subject  break the    silence  in memory of all the \angels who can't be here today   "
"instead of a yard sale or garage sale, can i have a picture sale????  what i mean is can i print out the pictures of all the stuff i want to sell and post it?  i know that's what <propmale>'s list is for, but i was hoping to do this an easier way   i am downsizing and have a lot of stuff to sell   i'll bring pictures to work for all my co-workers to see   buy buy buy!!!!!"

i just had the most wonderful visit with the little reverend mother  we went to cracker barrel for dinner   mmmmmm yummy!
my home computer just crashed  ughhhhhh  until i can replace it i guess i will be using my phone so messges will be few and far in between 
i'm baaaaaaaaack    
why does he thought of packing every possession i own disturb me so much?  i am not one to procrastinate but i am with this packing   i guess a part of me is sad to say goodbye to the life i've become so used to   but i am excited to start the next chapter in my life   it's all about fresh starts - right???  any e playful erienced packers out there????  lol
"true love isn't something you find when you are looking for it, it's something that finds you when you need it the most     "
"okay- so moving in 2 weeks, nothing packed yet  is that bad????? i have started putting boxes together   that counts doesn't it?  i hate this part   packing just sucks!!!!  too much going on to really get into packing, but it's not like i can really put it off either   good grief!!!"
"okay, so the laundry is packed and all boxes are upstairs   the office is packed and all boxes are upstairs   all that's left in the basement at this point is the desk, bookshelves, file cab, wahser dryer  whew!!!!  but it was <propfirst> that did all the carrying   my old back can't do that anymore  so i am renting a couple men on moving day to be the muscle    smile "
i just realized that sitting at the computer does not allow much packing to get done      very observant of me       lol   but i work well under pressure- so i am not worried    
"it's painting weekend   i get to play in the new place and do some painting and <propfemale> some blinds   6 more days!!!!!  looking forward to a c<propfemale>e of pace!  sad to leave the old place, but i still have my memories- and i will focus only on the good ones!"
"hmmm- never did get over there to paint, but i did pick out the color   lol  i dropped off all my cleaning supplies, blinds, and a few other things   then i spent the rest of the time packing   omg!!!  with everything i have already gotten rid of, where did all this stuff come from?  sheeesh!i have a system though  as each room or cabinet drawer is empty, i put a piece of blue tape on it so i know it's done "
"to all my peeps      closing down the computer for a few days   moving day is just around the corner, and i have so much to finish   i'll check on you all through my phone, but probably no responses for a while   hope to be back up and running sunday or monday   hugs and kisses to all!!!!!"
715 and the gas man just got here  i still have to take apart beds disconnect the w d and the ref water line  oh and take all the food to angelas

"the next time i move, it will be into the ground!!!!!  omg moving sucks!!!  but, i am almost completely unpacked and set up   those that know me well probably aren't surprised   but i still have things to finish up at the old place "
ahhhh!  no flood this time when i went back to the old house   i shut off the water and opened the lines  duh!!!!  now i even have all my clothes so i can change if i feel like it!  lol  every muscel in my body still hurts!  and you should see the cuts and bruises  i look like i was ran over by the truck- not my mailbox- which i replaced today   smile 
"spent most of the day on the couch fighting a low grade fever   i thought i was just tired and sore from moving, but today i had a fever   ughhhhhh  i finally got up and about and bought a (new) used dryer  cheaper to get a new dryer, than to have the gas company run a gas line "
"had a wonderful afternoon with the little reverend mother   we visited with <propfirst> for a while- he had a good day and drank all my dr pepper- so anyone going to see him, bring him a dr pepper   lol  then rev and i had lunch at <propmale> and <propfirst>'s  mmmmmm good!  thanks lil mother!!!  love you!"
"waiting on the dryer to be delivered   then get some much needed laundry done!  tomorrow is another \uhaul and cleaning out the garage at the old place- then i'm done and outta there!!!!  and of course <propfirst>'s bowling in the afternoon!  oh yipeeeeeee!"""
"wooo hooo-  only 2 hrs 15 minutes, and the garage is done and the truck back to uhaul, and guess what???????  i didn't take out my mailbox this time   lol  the only thing left at the other house is the fish!  not sure i want to bring them, gonna see if my son wants them for his kids, if not, they are up for grabs!  just a 10 gallon tank "
"my thrill for the day????  driving by the commerce bank in o'fallon today while it was being robbed   police everywhere with guns aimed at the bank   they were even laying on hwy k   creepy!!!  hope all is well, and they captured whoever it was "
"i can't sleep   too many meds???  maybe the wrong meds     this cold is killing me  my nose won't stop running, and the coughing isn't making my throat feel any better   i took some advil for the low grade fever   i am not a good patient  i want this gone!!!!!   ice cream- that's what i need   it will soothe my mood and my throat!   smile "
"anyone interested in a 21 speed giant cypress bike?  i paid over $300 a few years back   hardly used- in excellent shape!  asking $150   i have a picture i can share if you are interested   it's been in storage, and just time to sell it and realize i am not going to ride   lol"
"asking for some prayers to come out my way   <propfirst> has had 3 very hard seizures this morning already   he's taking his meds, but this is getting crazy!  one more and we a heading to the er   so please send some prayers out!!!"
he is finally sleeping   he didn't want to go to sleep because that's when the seizures happen   poor guy   he has 2 rug burns on his forehead from the first 2 seizures   he did this last year when he had the bad cold then too!  maybe it's something with the meds i am giving him counteracting with the anticonvulsants   i just want him better 
"okay- so he has me wrapped around his little boney, lanky, finger   he got imo's pizza for dinner   he actually ate 4 pieces, so he has some appetite   still complaining of a headache though   and, knowing me as you all do- i had to add insult to injury, and i sang the \little stevie\"" song      lol"""
"hard lesson learned   i may be the reason for <propfirst>'s increased seizures   apparantly the dextromethazone in cough medicine can cause seizures in people prone to them   soooooo everytime he has been sick, and i think i am helping him, i have been causing the increased seizures    sad "
"happy thanksgiving to my wonderful fb family!!!!  hugs, kisses, and much love go out to all of you!"
