<propfirst>'s all checked into unmc  again   his g-button is infected and the antibiotics that he was given have caused a lot of large diapers  want to make sure the he doesn't get dehydrated   will this week ever end!?!?!?!
"got our problems figured out  staph aureus growing in tummy, so, new antibiotics for that   bigger g-button, and more fluids over the next few days  the hiney is still very broken down but, i just signed discharge paperwork, and we will bust out of here once we get the new fluids!!! thanks for the thoughts and prayers!! they worked to finally get the answers that we need!!!! *pfew*"

"back in omaha   woke up with 102 7 fever and uber fussy  now it's down to 100 7 and still fussy, but, blood work has been negative all day long   maybe texas children's will find something for us in a few weeks    "
maryville's blood work came back with gram positive bacteria growing on <propfirst>'s central line  it's official   we've got our first line infection  look's like i will be spending the 4th up here  <propfemale>'s see what unmc's blood work grows   
"'lover, lover, lover   you don't treat me no good no more'   it just makes me want to jam out to the bellamy brothers for a while   i think i will while i wait for doctors to come do rounds   "
"unmc's blood work is still pending, but, so far, nothing is growing  so, was it a real line infection?? i don't know  but, soonest we would get out of here would be tomorrow, but, dr hottie thinks we will stay at least until the blood work grows out for 72 hours "
"unmc's blood work has come back positive  that means we do have a real line infection  the good news is that <propfirst>'s not showing any signs of being sick, so, we might not have to have surgery to pull the line  i will be in serious need of a back rub when this is all done   damn hospital chairs"
"a certain little boy, who shall remain nameless, keeps sitting up, looking at me, and giggling when he should be sleeping  i know school of rock is enthralling, and watchin <propfirst> cusaick 'hand dance' to a <propfirst> nicks classic is hard to pull away from!!"
what a dreary day   i was completely bored until i found the play room down the hall   jackpot!!!
"not sure why there were 3 cops down the hall from <propfirst>'s room on the pediatric floor, but, kidna creepy   met another family with irp   their little girl is sooooo cute!!!!"
"what a fun night   jodi, <propfirst> and <propmale> came up and we went and had dinner, drove go-carts, saw grown ups, and watched the fireworks   who had fun??? this girl did   whoohoo!!!the only thing that would have made it perfect was to have <propfirst> with us   "
"finally have an answer   we have a staph infection growing in <propfirst>'s central line  we have no plans for being discharged any time soon, so, i suppose i should just get comfy here "
we need to get the hell out of here   i don't think we can handle another day   at least i have family guy to look forward to   
whatever   all i have to say is whatever

"dear central line   logan and i have discussed this, and you are no longer welcome  you cause nothing but problems, and we feel that you need to leave  get your affairs in order, and please remove yourself soon  your services are no longer needed! sincerely   the mothership"
"<propfirst>'s back in the hospital  i spent the day in the er because he hadn't pooped all night, his tummy was hard and swollen, no bowel sounds, and he was screaming and crying  we finally transported him to omaha and about 9 smile 0 we got some poop  but   now, he's not peeing, so, we might need to talk to the urologist   he had a partial blockage, but, i don't know what they will do about that yet   waiting on doctors    "
"well   we don't have an answer as to what was causing the problem, but, peanut will be home tomorrow!!! i just hope that it's not something that happens again  i don't think any of us can go through that  mommy's pockets were so full of tears that i took from <propfirst> that i thought i was going to float awaay!! you inspire me <propfirst>!! i love you with all my heart!!!"
"mnrttoifgyuulkjnmfgredasyhjk;lkjnvb hgnffthfhb  vgjbyhuknhkfvbfrdwferterdgjbijmb n  hkygjubfgvhnkjj,n;p]o[98i,[-o0p-=[-k[]]\\     welcome home, peanut!!!!"
just got a call from unmc   logan's bloodwork grew out negative and positive  they think that whatever kind of infection that was in his bladder got into his blood stream and is making him sick  so   we are now on our way to omaha to admit him and get him started on antibiotics  damnit   we were sooo close!!
"we have a line infection again  we also found issues with his bladder and are waiting for radiology to read the results  the line infection grew out gram positive rods and unfortunately, we will be here until at least monday   as of now, we don't have any plans to pull the line, but, if we do, we will see how he handles not having it put back in   "
"the resident is shocked that we have not had a consult with a pediatric urologist  if his bladder was severe enough to cause a bowel obstruction, then something is wrong  i've gotten dr cusick involved (<propfirst>'s surgeon at children's) and we will find answers for peanut  the resident said his bladder was 'impressive' and should not have been so large  no word on line infection yet   "
"<propfirst>'s night nurse, mindee, is awesome  she just brought me an iowa hawkeye cupcake that she made for the husker texas game!! thanks mindee   it was just what i needed!!!!!"
"got the word that we get to come home today  we will continue with iv antibiotics for 4 more days, and then, do more blood work to make sure it's gone  we are waiting to get the consult with the urologist   that will be somewhere in iowa, so, i'm kinda hoping that we can get the consult at children's instead!!! start packing kiddo   we're going home!!!!"
"got a call from unmc again   all of <propfirst>'s blood cultures came back positive, so, the central line will have to be pulled, and stay for at least 5 days with vancomycin treatment in omaha  cusick is going to pull some strings to get the urologist over to see <propfirst> inpatient soon    this is enough to make me effing crazy!!!!!!"
"infectious disease has no idea how <propfirst> got this infection, and they aren't really sure what's going on with it  apparently, they rarely see this infection, and now aren't sure if they are going to pull the line  the transplant doctor on tonight isn't convinced it needs to be pulled, so, once again   we will wait   but   i need a drink  not the shit with a fruity umbrella  i need something stronger!!"
"<propfirst> is currently mowing the lanolium in his room waiting for the dr's to round  pulling the line is still up in the air, but, if it's pulled, it will be put back in  that means surgery  they think he got the infection from his probiotic  id has seen this infection maybe 5 times here, and no one else has ever seen it before!! fucking fabulous!!"
"infectious disease came around and said that while the line hasn't been pulled yet, there's a pretty good <propmale> that it will be on friday  they don't think that the vanco will treat through the line because the bacteria is sticky  literally   it creates a film over itself and repels medication   so  possibly surgery next week??"
"tonight   i'm just going to kick back, finish watching family guy, and have some mint chocolate ice cream   mmmmmm   "
"we had a good day   sat with <propfemale> and her family for maryn's surgery at children's, and ran into dr raynor and dr cusick  got big hugs from cusick, and a nice chat  maryn did great, then joy and <propfemale> came over to see logan   who is having a good day  he's peeing a lot, but, no word on cultures, but, the urologist did come by!! whoohoo!!"
"i thought we were going to have a crisis on our hands   i could not find gator last night  i looked all over, and thought he either threw gator away, or left him somewhere on a walk  the nurses went into panic mode when they found out, and <propfirst> was crying   all was well when i found him stuck under his stroller   *pfhew*  that was a clsoe one!!"
"unmc is going to piss me off   they are releasing <propfirst> today    we will treat through the line now  that was the plan on sunday, and now   4 days later, they are saying the same thing  we would not have had to go back  <propmale> and <propfirst> will stay in the lied tonight and tomorrow to make sure they don't call us back agian  gggrrrrrrr"
"<propfirst> got home last night, and the first thing he did when i walked in the door was grab my hand and walk me around the house  welcome home peanut!!"
"today's a big day for us   logan doesn't know it yet, but we are going to start potty training tonight  i'm getting a big boy potty tonight, and we are going to try this   any advice for little boys??? all i've heard is horror stories so far   "
"what i want to know is   how the hell does shit happen to us??? i got one out of the hospital, and i had to take the other tonight  <propmale> got bit by a brown recluse spider on his leg and wound up in the er  then, as i'm signing paperwork for him, i pick <propfirst> up and his diaper leaks poop all over me   what the hell!?!?!"
"anyone want to have a beer with me?? don't know how the glass in my living room table got broken, but, i got a video of <propfirst> playing in the middle where the glass goes   can october end early for me, please!?!?! i won't tell anyone, i promise!"
"to the migraine that decided to stop by for a visit again   go away  i don't like you, and i never have  i don't have time for you, and quite frankly   you just irritate me  this is the 7th time you have visited me, and you just need to stop!!"
"can't wait for grey's and practice   but first, i need to catch up on last weeks episodes   lasagna  i would like for you to meet my tummy   it's nice and cozy in there-you will like it!!! mmm-mmmmmmm!!!"
"why is it that the people that i don't like on project runway always win?? i get so excited for the season to begin, and wind up dissapointed by the end!!! damn you <propfirst> kohrs!!!"
"yoday did a great job trick or treating tonight!! he was the only yoda in town, and once he understood what he was supposed to do, he got all kinds of <propfemale>  he got to see all of his friends   even alivia!!! what a fun night    happy halloween!!!"
just got back from omaha   the central line has been pulled!!!! we no longer have one!! let's just hope that <propfirst> can keep himself hydrated enough to not need another one  we will know in a few weeks if it has to go back in   whoohoo!!!
