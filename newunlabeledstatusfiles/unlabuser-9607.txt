"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, being a bitch, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they left off, even if they have been months apart  they love you for who you are  re-post if u have @least 1 true friend  they will know who they are & still love you    "

"the past is history, the future is a mystery, but today is a gift from god  that is why we call it the present "
"â€œwhat you need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened, it has all worked together to bring you to this very moment  and this is the moment you can choose to make everything new  right now â€�"
1 corinthians 13
"\twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do  so throw off the bowlines  sail away from the safe harbor  catch the trade winds in your sails  e playful lore  dream  discover â€�"""
"we must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret  \the difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons "
life will always throw ya curve balls    thats when you hit it out of the park  laugh 
"so often times it happens that we live our lives in chains \and we never even know we have the key "
â€œwatching you walk out of my life does not make me bitter or cynical about love  but rather makes me realize that if i wanted so much to be with the wrong person how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along â€�
"all change is not growth, as all movement is not forward "
in three words i can sum up everything i've learned about life: it goes on 
"love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition "
"all changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another "
dreams have only one owner at a time  that's why dreamers are lonely 
the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are 
always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much 
"in any moment of decision the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing and the worst thing you can do is nothing "

"i just found out there's no such thing as the real world\just a lie you've got to rise above"
i used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone  it's not  the worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone

"problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines "
faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe 
"if you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?"
"love is evol, just spell it backwards and ill show ya"
"the man who travels fastest, travels alone"
no man chooses evil because it is evil  he only mistakes it for happiness; the good he seeks
defeat is not the worst of failures  not to have tried is the true failure 
happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present 
one day your life will flash before your eyes  make sure its worth watching
"we learn to love things that hurt, love things that we hate  because sometimes, those are the only feelings that keep us motivated"
"they love to tell you to stay inside the lines\but something's are better on the other side"
mastering others is strength  mastering yourself is true power
