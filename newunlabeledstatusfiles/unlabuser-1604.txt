its interesting to me how the things that make you cry are the things that can make you a better person  the feelings of losing all you know can make you look forward to something in the distant future  the people you thought would be in your life forever fade out; new people find a way to make up for the slack that others take upon themselves to create;break bonds  promises forgotten 
the heartache of tomorrow becomes apart of your being so well that not even you can shake it  so you sit there everyday making up excuses for the you questions you already know answers to and try to find a way to e playful lain whats already e playful lained  
happy easter everyone!! have a safe and blessed day! : )
woke up this morning  came home  took a shower  got dressed and realized i have nothing to do today

im tired  mad tired  its not a waste of time because the effort felt worth it  is it still the same? im sick of the illusions; all the smoke and mirrors bs im getting isnt  helping me at all  is it worth the problems? why do you find pleasure in me feeling discouraged?
just got home not too long ago had funn all day watching bad boys about to go to sleep in a few    
"finally!!\put internet on the laptop now i can get stuff done   "
people just know what to do and say to ruin my day  
having the longest conversation with davonte
well damn thanks for letting me know not even going to say it dont matter cause id be bullshitting if i was to; its unfortunate but im not living  in a fantasy not everything is meant to last  
i'm going to be changing not so people look my way  for the benefits of myself  drama and petty bs is no longer a way for people to see me  i've thought about it endlessly; life wouldn't be catastrophic without it  no longer will i pass up good things  thank you for the ones who love holding others back  if we didn't go through what i went through we wouldn't have known that better things were coming our way  
ugh! packing for ohio    love

slowly trying to find ways to stay busy and pick up the pieces of something that was broken for so long now  can't complain because i faithfully tried to avoid the situation  it didn't make it any better instead it just masked it until the day i had to face my fears

back in ky and already  it's been fun night so far  hopefully tomorrow holds some excitement too 
high 0ff happiness!!
mad tired  
most things are meant to change  
man today was enough to drive me to do things that i would forever regret but since all that is too much to deal with im just going to have to prioritize the people in my life; one by one; setting boundaries and maybe even removing the stressful things to help myself grow into the better person i know im capable of being  today was enough to make me think long and hard about myself and those around me  
i have good intentions even when it doesnt look like it  my motives might seem as if im only out for me but believe me you have nothing i could possibly want  im not gonna bs you and thats just how it is and i e playful ect the same from you  lifes too short not to keep things straight forward; too short to be caught up on the past; if you want things to happen you have to get out there and make them happen for yourself 
bored out of my effin mind right now  nothing to do  it's hot as satans womb right now and there is no relief no matter where i go!! on top of that i have a badass headache  
"i definately need some excitement in my life! new people in my life! new surroundings in my life! i'm content with the usual things and people in my life but, meeting new people cant do anything but help improve it right? so thats what i'm looking for     "
"its so simple if you hate it that much then stay single;\if you want a relationship hell let this be known \no one is a mind reader they're not going to know what\you want until you tell someone  {[silliness]}"
