i do not want to get up and have to start doing my errands for the day  i want to sit on my couch and do nothing  why can't i have a person to do all the work i do not want to do?
"put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered baby loss or infertility  ??? the majority won't put it on, because unlike most diseases, baby loss infertility is a taboo  ??? break the silence  ??? in memory of all the ~angel~ babies gone too soon but never forgotten, and the babies who were not possible but    are so loved "

"well, either i am a complete over-achiever, a ditz, or just clueless  i went to school today for my first class  only to find out the doors were locked and i was the only one there, b c it is <propfirst> <propmale> <propmale> day  i even knew it was a holiday, but b c i had to work it never hit me that all schools were closed  just have to laugh at myself at this point    playful "
"even though i could not go to school today, i just managed to finish my first real online homework assignment  yeah!"

"good nite, i am one tired little girl "
"finally, enough snow to get excited about "
"hates when children make you feel old  children in my complex were scraping snow off the cars with ice scrapers  i would not care if they were scraping the windows, but they were scraping the paint  i asked 3 times for them to stop  then they asked if they could kick the ice off of the cars! finally, i got their parents phone number, and called their mom "
"snowy day, seems like a good day to knock out some homework  i may even manage to pack up a few boxes this afternoon "
one <propmale> homework assignment down  only one more big one and just some reading to catch up on 
had a fight with a hill and a sled  the hill got the best of me  but i took out the sled in one try  but i ruined everyone else's fun in the process

"at 6 am my alarm clock went off, i jumped up and started getting ready for work  after i am halfway awake, i realize it is saturday morning and i do not have to be anywhere  now, i am wide awake  this stinks!"
"if only i had kept all of my strawberry shortcake toys from when i was a kid, i would have alot more money in my pocket right now "
it has taken me 3-4 hours to pack my kitchen  and that is not including the food  why is it that the smallest room in the apartment is taking the longest? and where did all of this useful stuff come from?
"it is funny that i almost have the whole house in boxes in the spare room  and it is even more hilarious that it is starting to drive <propmale> nuts  we are down to eating off of paper plates and bowls, plastic forks and spoons, foam cups, getting sugar out of ziploc baggies, and my clothes are scaled down to just what i need for the next 3 weeks  he is so lucky that i have not tackled his clothes "
i have done homework for the past 7 hours  i am exhausted  i guess that is what happens when you do not set time aside and do little by little 
"cannot sleep, this stinks!"
"in 60 days, i will be on a ship sailing to a place that my phone does not even reach! i am so excited "
thank goodness it is friday!!!!!!!!!!
"yeah, one quiz down  and i made a good score on it  it is amazing how much you can retain, when you are reading about something you are interested in "

i am at mom's baking my little heart away  i am so tired  but it will be worth it in the end 
"my favorite movie quote is from steel magnolias  it sounds like something i would have done not that many years ago  lol annelle: we are in the house of the lord!  clairee belcher: oh like she cares  ousier's never done a religious thing in her life   ouiser boudreaux: now that is not true  when i was in school, a bunch of my friends and i would dress up as nuns and go bar-hoppin' "
"finally, i am home and able to relax!"
"i have to work in one of the best departments in vanderbilt  not only do i get to help patients during one of the most momentous times in their lives, my clinic also knows how to throw a party to show their appreciation for their employees  only if every day could be like today "
there is a cake competition in nashville the week i will be on vacation! i am so upset that i will miss it    sad   at least i will be where it is warm that week  maybe next year i will participate
