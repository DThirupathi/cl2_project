the power of the twelve year old girl   i so don't get the american idol boy choices 
i'm off to the cabin for a few days 
i was in the middle of a really good dream last night and then i got <propmale> rolled 
"there is very little we can gain from those who share all of our views about the world  by surrounding ourselves with people who agree with us, we buffer ourselves from reality, choosing for ourselves the lens by which we see  it is those who most diametrically oppose us in philosophy and practice who can be our greatest teachers "
"if i can find myself so completely aligned with any particular ideology that i do not disagree at all, i have checked my brain at the door and allowed someone else to do my thinking for me   independant thought is born of any real search for truth "
   and the round headed buffoon that is <propfirst> pilkington 
"â€œgod, <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference â€�"
"of all the memories i could take with me, this would top them all         ?"
"conner, my 13 year old, said to me in the car yesterday, \ it just occurred to me how truly strange you are \""  hahahaha!"""
"\even the smallest person can change the course of the future\"" â€” galadriel (lord of the rings)"""
"\certainty of death  small <propmale> of success  what are we waiting for?\"" -gimli"""
"more teenage quotes, from christian, the fifteen year old this time, when i didn't agree to do what he wanted   \you were much more malleable when you were half asleep \""  haha!!! precious!  he's off to <propfemale> now with his youth government delegation   only two teenagers remain to try to shape and mold me to their will  : ))"""
"happy mother's day, moms!!!  especially my own wonderful mommy!"
is loving spring!
is leaving for the weekend 
"happy father's day to all the dad's out there, especially mine!"
is off to the cabin for some work and hopefully relaxation 
we've been off the internet for a couple days   have been rewiring the house 
wishing <propfirst> a happy birthday!!!
it was so fun to get all of the wonderful birthday wishes!  thank you!!  had a great day at the cabin with the family   bought myself some fun stuff in <propmale> and relaxed by the river   i'm sipping a glass of wine in the dark now   just listened to a train go by  now i'm hearing what i hope is just a raccoon outside   right?
"i have two extra tickets to the american idol concert tonight at key arena at 7 smile 0, if anyone would like to go   "
"we considered not even going to the american idol concert this year, but after the concert i'm thinking this year was possibly the most talented overall  surprising!"
"have computer for the first time now   jus ttyped a big long thing, then accidently erased it   thank you so much for your prayers, comments, love, help and offers of help!colby was hit on his motorcycle by a <propfirst> failing to yeild on tuesday at about 6:15   "
<propfirst> is in surgery to repair the incision in his leg and see what they could do with his ankle 
<propfirst> is in recovery and we are waiting to speak to the surgeon   
"surgery went well, they worked on his legs, partially closed the wound, put more steel in for the ankle, assessed his knee, which has multiple ligament damage   his stats are still good   he is headed back to recovery now   "
"<propfirst> is resting in the icu   they're keeping him pretty drugged so he can rest up after the surgery   he will be on ventilation for awhile, but his stats are looking better than they have been   thank you for all your prayers and well wishes for <propfirst>  it means a lot to everyone here "
"<propfirst> is a bit more alert, which is good and difficult   they are cutting back his sedation to try to reduce the anxiety of coming in and out   praying for lower bp, better oxygen saturation as they turn his oxygen levels down and that he would be calm   he is understanding more and it is scary for him, obviously   hoping to get off ventilation by tomorrow if all goes well "
"so touched by messages from loved ones, old friends and even total strangers   we all so appreciate your prayers and positive thoughts on <propfirst>'s behalf!"
"<propfirst> is responding more quickly to us now   his eyes can focus on us and he nods or shakes his head   bp is down a bit, digestion is working, has been having pain in his stomach, that seemed to help   oxygen still really needs to stabilize so he can get rid of the ventilator "
"fyi   lots of people coming tomorrow   for those of you from my circle, i am on the night shift tonight and could possibly be asleep until early afternoon   that's optimistic, but still   just so you know "
<propfirst>'s temperature is normal at the moment  wow! we want his heart rate to come down  it's been consistently about 145+ for a long time   they don't really know why    ventilator will need to be in for a while  he has some broken ribs and vertebrae   too painful for normal breathing just yet   his arm and his pelvis are bothering him he has a small pelvis fracture and his arm is just banged up 
"<propfirst> has fluid on his lungs that they think is causing the high heartrate   would like to see that resolve   they are postponing his surgery for tomorrow, they were going to try to close his openleg incision, because of the lung issue and the heartrate   they put him on a morphine drip   waking up a lot today "
"just posted by <propfemale> miller, a dear friend of colby's: please read!!!"
"<propfirst>'s oxygen levels in his blood are much better, which is a good step toward getting the ventilator out  heart rate is still high, fever is back up- not sure why  he likes being on his left side, lots of contusions on the right, so i think it just hurts   morphine drip seems to be working better for pain management   he will actually say that he's not in pain sometimes, which is so great "
<propfirst> will be having another minor procedure this morning to hopefully close the open wound   i had a hard moment last night that i e playful lain in a comment on the last status   hard to see him wake up and not know where he is or what happened every time   at least he's not having to wake up so much now because of the drip 
"just talked to the nurse about shearing   something to pray about   with a high impact accident like <propfirst>'s, the connections between cells in the brain get severed in varying degrees   this is one of the reasons they keep letting him wake up   so far he's responding to commands pretty well, but we want to pray that all those connections will heal so he will have full cognitive skills intact "
"<propfirst> just completed his first breathing trial   he breathed on his own for about forty five minutes and did really well   they will do it again tomorrow   can't take him off ventilation yet, even though he can breathe on his own because of the high heart rate and the high pain level   he needs too many drugs right now, which can slow down respiration   it is encouraging though and a step in the right direction "
<propfirst> is resting comfortable-ish   heart rate down to 112-128 instead of 140-158  fever went up to 103 64 last night   they put him on a cooling blanket which is hooked up to a refrigeration unit type thing   it's down to 100 2 now   he will likely go back to surgery this morning to clean and hopefully close the incision  and maybe   please please please   get rid of the ventilator 
"<propfirst>'s in surgery now   he went in late, around 1 surprise 0   he's scheduled for about two hours "
"<propfirst> is out of surgery   it went really well   they were able to close the incision all the way without a skin graft   he is back on the morphine drip  it will take awhile for him to be alert enough to do another breathing test, so maybe this evening and then hopefully soon after, get him off ventilation   thank you so much for all your prayers and thoughts for <propfirst>   we are encouraged by his progress so far "
"having a frustrating moment   between nurse and  respiratory shift changes, they have forgotten that he was supposed to have a breathing test and get his tube out tonight   they are saying there is no order for the test, so there not going to do it   having a hard time with that "
"<propfirst> is in the middle of a breathing test right now   if it goes well, they will remove the ventilator  please pray for a good result   he is breathing long deep breaths right now "
"<propfirst> has a masochistic nurse at the moment, which is making coping difficult   <propfirst>'s heart rate will be up at 160 and his breathing at 50 per minute and he's yelling at him about where he is   are you in a boat, are you in church, etc , and then telling him i know you're miserable, but at least your alive, tomorrow you won't have near this much medication and how are you going to handle it then"
"praise god, <propfirst>'s off ventilation and can talk to us   he said to say thank you to everyone   he asked if <propfirst> had been here and about his grandparents   we talked about the accident, which he doesn't remember   he said he wants the biggest water they can give him   he's on an oxygen mask, can't drink yet   his heart rate is high "
"the doctor cleared <propfirst> for fluids  he's had ice water, orange juice, apple juice and green jello "
"<propfirst> is sitting up and eating a little, reading his messages, he can read texts, but not really answer them   his hands are numb   they are doing an mri of his knee damage tonight and willprobably be moving him out of the icu to a regular room today   don't quite have his pain management under control, but they're working on it "
"<propfirst>'s still in the icu, because the acute care floor is full  please pray for <propfirst>'s spirits as the realization of his situation hits him and really for all of us emotionally   now that he is out of the woods, it is really hitting all of us differently   yours prayers have really gotten us through this hard time "
"it sort of feels like we have moved from the four seasons to the ghetto now   i was just kidding about posting less i guess   we are in a room just big enough to fit my bed chair and <propfirst>'s bed and his rolling tray, all jammed up against each other   i have intermittent thoughts off taking the bed and running down the hall with it, just to see how far i'd make it "
haven't been on the computer all day   busy day   colby is having a rough day   went to get an mri and had a panic attack   having trouble getting an iv in   they've brought in the big guns after poking him cuzzillion times   been waiting for pain meds for an hour 
<propfirst> is having panic attacks and feeling very anxious right now   pray for comfort for him   
"<propfirst> had a long night, but after a transfer from his bed to a wheelchair and a trip around the 7th floor, he is zonked   he needs sleep   i'm going to the \safe house\"" to get some sleep myself   """
"<propfirst> has been doing status updates for me, because i have been with <propfirst> since we were moved out of the icu and hadn't slept in all that time really   lots of anxiety and panic, which is better today after him getting some sleep last night   maybe it was the morphine, i don't know   the doctor and nurse said it was a result of dealing with trauma   anyway   "
"<propfirst> is having a lot of pain in his right knee, back and chest  waiting for approval for an iv anti-inflammitory   he's e playful eriencing deafness in his right ear, they think due to a viral infection   they are starting a steroid regiment to reduce swelling in his ear   bp and heart rate are still a little elevated, but not dangerously so "
"amazing news   <propfirst> may be able to come home tomorrow!  they are going to wait on the ligament surgery it sounds like and he is doing so much better and strong enough to move himself around, so   we will let you know when it's for sure and when we are safe at home   we love you all and thank you for being so supportive of us and <propfirst> through this time   we are all amazed at the outpouring of love and concern   love "
the fundraising link below is something <propfirst>'s friends are doing for him   they are raising funds to buy him an xbox to givre him something fun to do while he's layed up 
we got home with <propfirst> yesterday   so nice to sleep in my own bed   <propmale> powel and friends loaned us lots of fun things for <propfirst> to use while he recovers   i'll post the home pics soon   so grateful!
"so thankful for the power of god and prayer and bodies that heal themselves   <propfirst>'s body was covered with huge bruises and contusions that don't exist anymore   i've had the same little bruise for a month  please pray for <propfirst>'s right ear    he currently has significant hearing loss that they say may be permanent, due to nerve damage   doctors are trying a steroid treatment to try to help "
"headed to harborview tomorrow   <propfirst> has three appointment tomorrow with different departments for check ups, removing stitches, to plan ligament surgery and test his ear again "
"<propfirst> went to harborview today   his bones are healing   spoke to one of the surgeons who actually performed some of his surgeries   very interesting, him e playful laining all the myriad of shattered and broken things   they said he can begin to slowly put weight on his left leg   no more brace on that leg    in about a month he should be able to try to walk with that leg on crutches "
\no \,a4a94a0b63441e4a096d85d0ed7be6f6,"<propfirst> saw the uw surgeon today and he said <propfirst> can begin slowly putting weight on both legs and working on straightening the one that has been stabilized for so long   we went in e playful ecting to have to wait for a surgery date and then a long recovery to even start to heal, so he could hope to walk by christmas   too many details to go into, but amazing news today!"
