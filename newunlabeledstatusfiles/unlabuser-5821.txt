the voice in the back of my head always gets the best of me 
"one thing i know for sure is that i do not fear death  i will chortle after hydroplaning and, after being narrowly missed by an oncoming 18-wheeler that i pulled out in front of, i throw my head back and cackle  having high regard for one's life is just myth "
"attempting to find and listen to every screamo version of rap songs out there  man, i really dig the synthesis of hip hop rap screamo heavy metal   "
": wishes that people from bryn mawr would contact me on this account instead of the practically e playful ired one that i used in high school    *cough, cough* take the hint! *cough*"

"when faced with an academic challenge, a lot of people use their intelligent brains to get through it  i usually just use my hard head to smash through it   "
i've split the poles; i've walked senior row in its entirety; i've sat (and fallen asleep) upon the <propfemale> bench; i've descended and ascended the senior steps; i've put my own candle into my lamp and then blown it out again  why? because superstition is dogma  any other bryn mawr superstitions out there? tell me them! i'm on a quest to break them all

"so i found out   bryn mawr is actually only #25 on the list of highest ranked liberal arts colleges in the nation  this puts us behind swat and haverford  c'mon, people, we can do better than that  quit your screwing around (literally) and lets's increase our ranking by becoming a little more erudite and disciplined "
"some of these bryn mawr womyn really drive me up the fucking wall  they're either too emotionally intense or think that, just because they go to an all-women's college, that gives them the right to be rude and bitch about every last thing that other people do  if one more person tells me to shush, they're going to earn nothing but a sore face   "
"no love from bryn mawr, man   "
"omfg, i dread x-mas   "

"someone on this campus has to be concerned about not being emotionally sensitive, politically correct, scrupulous and unconcerned with absolute pragmatism  someone has to be the symbolic puppet that'll represent who bmc students really are under the self-righteous, conformist facade  someone has to be that genuine element that is part of all humanity that is missing here  might as well be me "
