this has been a long ass week for all of us at work  thanks guys for everything you've done  love you all!!!
it has been a very long day at work  i am more than ready to go home and relax for the day  i just wish that i didn't have to deal with so much b s  sometimes 
this is way too much snow!!! i can't remember the last time i saw this much snow  we have gotten heavy snow 4 times in 2 weeks and a huge one right before christmas!!! i want it to stop already!!!!
<propfirst> can't have cancer      he is too young    i just can't believe it     
about to interview for a management position  hopefully i get it!!!!!
hmmm    been a long day    ready to go home and relax     
i think things are all falling apart around me and then something wonderful happens  today my brother finally decided what he needs to do to fix his life and i am so proud of him  i hope everything works out for him the way it should     
nothing is gonna hold me back!!! i'm a big girl now and can handle all my own shit!!!
wish i could just clock in and start working already!!!! i really hope today goes by fast
thank god it's friday  i am so ready to have my little baby with me  i miss her!
nap time!!!!!
"i admit it! i'm a handful!!! unfortunately most women won't repost this  i'm strong willed, independent, and outspoken, i make mistakes, i am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best  if you're a handful then    post this on your status    i dare you"
hmmm    i really need to figure out what it is that i want and how i am gonna get it    
"tough girls come from new york    sweet girls, they're from alabama    but us texas girls, we have fire & ice in our blood! we can ride horses, be a debutante, throw left hooks, & <propfemale> with the boys; all the while making sweet tea; darlin', &if we have an opinion, you know you're gonna hear it! nuthin like beinga texas girl!!!!! if u r a true texas girl repost this!!!"
i don't know why i have to feel like this    so worried all the time that someone is about to screw me over     too much heartache     
let's see who is paying attention     everysingle one of you are on my friend list is a result of a conscious decision  i am not only glad to count you as friends but also as family!    let's see who in my friends list actually pays attention    copy and paste this in your status  i will be watching to see who reposts wink  thank you for caring
a friend is someone who walks in when everyone else walks out 
ooh    i hate liars!
a man who hits a woman isn't a man at all
"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear  while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your woman cry there's a man stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence"
my baby got to go to the circus   i wish i had been there to see her face   sad 
"well, i'm off to bed   been a long day and i'm more than ready to crash     good night world"
i'm more than ready to go home! it's napping weather today! the sunshine needs to hurry up and come back!!!
i love friday's  they are the one thing that's guaranteed to make me smile! i love my little baby!
some bands are strictly for old people and little kids    glad that <propfemale> had fun at least 
oh! i ate way too much    should really learn to limit my food intake! but i love food so much!
my phone has officially decided not to work    gotta go figure out why when i get outta here  so sorry to everyone who just can't wait to hear my sweet voice  playful 
ugh!!! why do men have to be so damn stubborn all the time? the world does not revolve around you!!!
3 days to baby shower   lots to do!!
i'm done with the bullshit already     step up damnit!!!!
baby shower was a success!!! and now i get to relax and enjoy my evening!!!
today is a good day for you to dream  beware that structured forces may try to convince you that the route you want to take isn't exactly the most practical  you don't necessarily have to be practical in order to be successful or prosperous  use your imagination  let your creative spirit lead you to the next step  find true strength in your ability to recognize and understand the needs of others
why is it that just when you think you are starting to know someone you find out that things are not at all what they seem?
it's never been about how i feel or what i think     why can't it just be about me for once? 10 mins of pure me time would be nice    
"mother is god in the eyes of a child  <propfemale> protect and love them every day  keep in mind they didn't ask to be here, you made that choice for them "
i don't think i ever get enough sleep! so sleepy    wish i could stay in bed and snuggle with a special person     
"i think people should just quit judging others for what they do! let them live their own lives and be happy  we all have to learn from our own mistakes  until that moment   we are all going to do what we want to do  and for those who say if a person does certain things they're going to hell     whatever happened to \only god shall judge me\"" or \""judge not least ye be judged\""?"""
how do i just end this?
"hmm      yet another day in \paradise\"""""
mmmm     
when will the good that i've been waiting for finally come to me?
where are you when i need you?
it's been a much better day today (so far)  thank you all for being so great to me! i love ya all!! *muah*
got absolutely no sleep last night  spent the whole night tossing and turning  just one question    why am i so damn misunderstood? everytime i have good intentions they end up biting me in my ass! well i'm done  if you don't like the real me  go get fucked!
"true heroism is remarkably sober, very \undramatic  it is not the urge to surpass others at whatever the cost, \but to serve others at whatever cost - <propfirst> ashe"
get to file for my divorce on tuesday!!! yay!!!
blah blah blah   ya de dadada!
does he want to be dead before he even gets the <propmale> to see his father? doesn't he know that people really care about him and that bitch only cares about the next hit? what's more important    drugs or your family and friends?
thank you for always cheering me up! *muah*
this is starting to get really irritating!!!
some people need to learn to control their tempers    and not cuss me out for doin my job the way it should be done    stupid custodians!!!!
here's to knowing that things are slowly getting better  all it takes is hard work and persistance  my advise to everyone is to never give up on what you really want  work to make your dreams come true  love my friends!
there comes a time in our lives when we have to stop thinking about all the wrongs done to us and move on  wallowing in self pity will get us nowhere in life  sadly most of us have to learn this the hard way 
if you're brave copy this in your status & see what people rate you   (1)crazy (2) wish we went out (3) talkative (4)sarcastic (5) loveable (6)kissable (7) strong ( smile  dumb (9) spoiled (10)weird (11) wild(12) goofy(13) funny (14) awesomely awesome (15) amazing (16) beautiful(17) cute   (1 smile  sexy (19) slow (20) no words can e playful lain---kind of scared to read what people think!
a word of advice: survival is not about who is the strongest or who can hurt who the most  it's about knowing how to keep yourself out of situations where you have to fight to survive 
now is the time for me to do what's right for me and my daughter 
ugh!!!! i hate the rain!! why does my house have to flood every big rain storm we get? how do i stop it? gonna be up all night trying to clean this mess up and stop it from getting worse!
oh so tired this morning     not looking forward to a long day at work at all    blah!!
you never know when something is going to come along and change your life forever  don't be afraid of change 
i really need to make a few changes in my life  i'm more than ready for my new beginning 
why is it that things decide that they are gonna fall apart for me at the world's worst time? it's a very good thing i am who i am   otherwise it might all be enough to make me snap    
"if it weren't for my friends, i would be lost  thank you all! i love you guys!"
water just broke   so hopefully we get to meet addison soon!
"baby addison is here! she was born at 5  as soon as i have more details, i will let you all know!"

">rest in peace nutter butter! you will be missed<\this is all really hard to believe! an unarmed man shot by the police!?!? what kind of world do we live in where people aren't safe from the people who are supposed to protect us?"

why must the simplest things be so difficult to take care of?
"i have carried a child within my body   i have comforted a baby on my chest   my body is not magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror isee a mother, and there is no greater honor or blessing! make this yourstatus if your proud to be a mother! i love, love, love my beautiful    babiy! nothing better than being a mommy!!!"

"i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of <propfemale> and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under god, indivisible, with <propfemale> and justice for all  (i grew up saying this in school every morning- it's a shame we can no longer do that for fear of offending   someone)  now,let's see how many ame      ricans will re   post        !!i am proud to be that american and stand for what i believe in"
"i am looking to adopt a dog in need  as much as i would love to take a puppy, i am more intrested in rescuing a dog that is in danger of bein put down  i want a dog that will get along with my 4 year old daughter and be a good guard dog  if anyone has any information to help me find what will be the newest member of my family, please send me a message! thank you!"
sometimes i don't know what to do   how to handle certain things! i spend all week teaching my daughter manners and then she goes to her dad's house and comes back to me with worse behavior than the week before! what am i gonna do?
i feel so sick right now    and lost
uuugggghhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! i freaking hate men!
"my mind is made up: i am going to find out exactly what is causing my daughter to act out and then i'm gonna handle the problem  and he can get as angry as he wants at me, but if he really thought about it (or cared) he would see that i am doing it for my baby!"
"i have carried children within my body  i have comforted a baby on my chest  i have kissed booboos, mended broken hearts, been puked & peed on, woke up in the middle of the night to a feverish child & more  but i wouldn't have it any other way  my body isn't magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see a mom,       and there is no greater honor or blessing  make this your status if you are proud to be a mom!"
i am determined to make today a good day  i will find a way to aleviate my stresses and hold my head up high  i am a strong and independent woman!!!
i like it on the dining room table!!!
