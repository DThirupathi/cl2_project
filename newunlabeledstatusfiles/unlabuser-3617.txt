gixer was born november 4 at 806 am he weighs 1 lb 8  oz and is  12  in long at this time both mom and baby and stable and doing well gixer will be staying at the childrens hospital in grand rapids
just checked on gixer  so far today he is doing good his test have all come back on the positive side
gixer is still doing great there were no problems last night his breathing is good he has been keeping most if not all of each feeding down i am so proud of my mini man now he just needs to keep it up
gixer is doing good today they just took him back off the breathing regulator and are going to let him try breathing without  it for awhile that was kinda nerve racking to watch but he is calm and sleeping again
well mini man has had a rough couple of hours after they took his breathing regulator out he got clogged up and had to go back on it then there was problems getting his feeding tube in then his iv got clogged and now they have to poke him every time they want to do test poor thing is all worn out and is sleeping again
so far today mini man is doing better they have him on insulin due to blood sugar but they said that was normal and that all of the white blood cells he is producing are healthy
http annoyed  www wix com gixerlove gixer
mini man is doing really great today his blood sugar went down some and today they are doing a brain scan to make sure everything is looking good in his head also they are putting him on a med to close the hole in his heart that all babys have while they are inside you but that close by themselfs on full term babys
ok so got the brain scans back and gixer has old blood in his brain nothing new it could have been caused from the birth or from all the stress he was under the other day its on his left side and there is a possibility he may have problems with moving legs or arms but no way to tell untill he is older and close to going home
well my mini man is a week old today and he is doing great he was opening his eyes and helping me with his diaper
so tomorrow they are going to try to take gixers breathing ventalator out agian to see if he is able to breath on his own  they said that even if he is only off for an hour that it will be good for his lungs to try to work by themselfs  poor little guy it so hard on his body to do this tho so i really hope that he will not have to go on agian 
mini man had a really good night he had a heart scan this morning and we will find out the results later today to see if the hole closed in his heart
he had his first temper tantrume he was getting a shot of vitamine a it was the cutest thing his little face got all squished up and the arms and legs where everywhere
ok so the heart scan came back the hole has not closed yet so they are going to run the med untill sunday and check again they put a picc line in so they can take out his belly cords they placed it on the side of his head and it means soon i will be able to hold him and do skin to skin contact
he is doing great today he is still on his stomace and was not happy with the nurse when she did the labs today he was able to lift his head up using his upper body i just cant belive how strong he is
mini man is sleeping peacefully right now he had another heart scan this morning and we will get the results back some time this after noon his breathing is still up and down so they are going to keep him on the regulator for at least another day
mini mans heart scan came back he still has a hole but it is alot smaller have to talk to the doctor tomorrow to find out what the next step is
the doctors said that his hole is small enough that they dont have to give him any more med for it and tomorrow they are going to try to take the tubes out of his mouth
mini man is doing okay today he has been haven some problems with his breathing going up and down but the setting is still not to high but they what it to go back down before they try to take him off the breathing vent also until the settings go down i will not be able to hold him  sad 
mini man is doing better today his breathing is a better and he got his first paci today and was able to suck on it with out any help
mini man has been off his vent since noon and now he is on a nippv his next step will be a cpap yay
mini man was doing so good today they went ahead and took him off nippv and now he is on the cpap i just cant believe how great he is doing
well mini man is doing good this morning he did not seem to like the cpap so he went back on the nippv thats okay tho cuz its still an improvement from the vent
my mini man is two weeks old today! he worked really hard in the last 28 hours but he got to tired to breath on his own anymore so he went back to the breathing tubes  poor lil guy has had a hard couple hours but he is resting agian and is back to being stable 
mini man is doing better today his breathing is stable on his tubes and his sugar level is normal but he does have an infection so they have him on antibodys
mini man is doing great today he was wiggling all over the place but once i started reading to him he calmed down and fell right to sleep
mini man cant decide if he wants to use the breathing vent or do it on his own i think he is still tired from working so hard the other day but he is stuborn so he has to keep trying when he should be sleeping
mini man is doing great today his breathing is picking up they did have to put him back on insulin but it is a low amount
mini man is doing good today his blood sugar has gone back to normal and his infection is down he is doing better on his breathing today now he just needs to keep it up
mini man is still doing great i am so proud of him his sugar is a little low but not to bad i am hoping they try to take him back off the vent soon cross fingers that he does good
cant wait mom is on her way up should be here in about 5 hours as long as she dont get stopped in traffic do not piss the gps off mom lol
gixers birth amouncement went into the paper today i cant wait to see it
happy turkey day mini man is three weeks old today he is looking so good and still holding strong
mini man had a rough night and day his stats have been dropping pretty low during care time his breathing is almost half on his vent now
mini man is doing much better today they took his vent settings down to thirty percent so his is breathing more on his own than he was and they cut his labs in half so he will not have to get poked every six hour
mini man is having a good day so far he was bright eyed and holding moms hand his vent is down so he is breathing more on his own but he lost weight last night the little stinker he was at  ! lb 14 but is back to 1 lb 11

"holding my child for the first time was just beyond words, the best i can say was that it was zen like  calming and as if the world was finally right   we were able to bond for almost three hours and the whole time his stats were sky rocketed he was almost completly breathing on his own  im so thankful for my mini man and so proud of how well he did "
mini man is having his pda closed on wed so he is going to have to be cut opened  its very bitter sweet it will help him with his breathing but at the same time im scared about the surgery  i know he is a fighter and he will do great its just hard to think about such a little guy going threw this 
gixer is off the tube and back on the nippv vent he is doing so much better the tube had a <propmale> leak and he was doing most of his own breathing so they decided to go ahead and try agian on his nippv
i'm planning on having my baby shower on <propfirst> 15 if you would like an invitation please message me your address
mini man is up to 2 lbs 6 ozs now!! he has almost gained 1 lb since he was born he seems to be doing okay he was destating a little bit with his heart dropping and his breathing going down but for the most part he has been pretty steady 
gixer had his surgery today he did wonderful he will have a scar about the length of a finger and his pda was so large that they had to use two clamps to close it  right now he is in la la land on pain meds and seems to be pretty happy about it  thank you everyone for the well wishes 
"mini man is doing great with his recovery he was more alert today and moving a little more, he has been destating here and there with his heart rate droping really low and his breathing going down but the doctors said that was to be e playful ected right after surgery "
gixer is doing great he got the vent taken out and is on the nippv so he is breathing more on his own and he is eatting again also they took him off the pain meds he was pissed off this morning and in some pain but by this afternoon he seemed happier and more alert then he has in days 
my mini man is doing good today he had his first eye exame today he has premature eyes which is to be e playful ected since he was born at 24 weeks they eye doctor will see him every two weeks to see how he is progressing  he is on day 4 of being on the cpap breathing machine hopefully he will not have to have that tube back in  he is recovering great from his surgery  im so proud of him
mini man got a bath today he is such a water baby he just loved it we had his cpap off and he was breathing all on his own for the whole bath but he was pretty worn out afterwards so the cpap had to go back on but it was so cute he was splashing around and just floting in the water 
my mini man is 7 weeks old he has come so far and is doing so good  he is 2 lbs 13 ozs now and i  can finally hear him cry its very soft and you have to be close to him to hear it but it is the most beautiful sound i have ever heard he so fiesty and gets mad so easy poor thing got my temper lol i hope that every one has a wonderful christmas and dont drink to much egg nogg and watch out for those darn mistle toe 
"gixer is now 3 lbs!!!! thats double what he started as, the doctors said that soon he will be able to stop using the cpap and will start for a few hours every day breathing on his own i cant wait "
i hope everyone has a very happy new year and is very safe please if your going out dont forget a dd  i plan on spending the new year with gixer! he's up to 3 lbs 2 oz
my mini man is doing so good! he is now on nasal canula which is just strait oxagen so he is enflating his own lungs now yay! they are going to start bottle feeding him this week i'm so excited we are hopping to be able to bring him home by the end of the month 
i am so nervous they are going to start working on bottle feeding gixer this week but because he is a preemie we have to go super slow so he doesn't asperate and have to go back on the breathing tube  he had his eye exam and has stage 1 rop which means there is a line that is stoping his blood vess from completely developing  i'm so proud of my mini man tho he is getting so big hes 3 lbs 8 ozs now! yay
gixer tried his first bottle today i am so proud of him he ate 8 ml the first time and 6 ml the second and i got to burp him for the first time it was so cute it seemed to startle him back awake lol  i've only been gone a few hours but i already miss his face  we made it safely back to northern mi with no problems and have a full  and fun week planed ahead 
my mini man is doing great he is 4 lbs 2 oz  he now has the lid of his incubator open and is taking at least one full bottle a day he get sleepy most the time and can't finish but that's okay hes little i understand   i miss him like crazy and have been really sick since i left grand rapids i hope i get over this soon cuz it will really suck to be three minutes from my son and not be able to see him 
oh my mini man is going to be a monster he is growing so much he is now 4 lbs 7 ozs  they moved him to the new hospital so he now has his own room and i can stay the night in the room i can't wait to see him today i have missed him so much
