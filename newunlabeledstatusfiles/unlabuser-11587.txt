"is there something wrong with wanting to look good yet in your 50s??  my mom seems to think that i am trying to look like i am in my 20's or younger! i don't think just because you become 50 or 60 that you have to look old! my grandmother died when she was 99, and she still looked good   guess i should be used to it by now   but it still hurts my feelings oh well!!"
