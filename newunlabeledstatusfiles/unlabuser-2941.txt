just conformed into getting facebook 
"i dont see why people like facebook  just sitting here, not really productive  i think           yup, facebook has begun to eat my brain cells  "
"i think alot of people hate me, true?"
"i want more friends on facebook, send me invites please   smile "
i want to break my phone 
"i was born in the wrong time  man, <propfemale> shaw was a great musician  listen to a song called nightmare "
"my phones broken again  \so aggrivated   sorry if i cant answer texts "
says i hope ive made a good investment 
"is bored, and to tired to continue painting "
"says check out my <propmale> and comment on it, \dont be to mean please "
"come on people, really? \only like three people have posted on my <propmale> "
feels kinda down 
doesnt care anymore 
the beginning of the end is the beginning
"\its no longer fun\"""""
sowing season
"i feel like my heads on fire and im screaming while being dragged to the bottom of a lake  other than that, im a little sore "
brand new-play crack the sky             over and over again 
is running from problems 
"on my mind right now is how it seems like every friend i get close to will eventually tear away from me, at least eventually  im also thinking about the ironic and angering events that have happened so far  im also thinking about priorities  the doors, and the hermit  i give you the frame of the picture so at least you can see im still awake "
"part 2\like me though it remained the same  it won't stop smiling because it is insane  a person would call it a monster, but i would say it is a loyal and old friend that returned to me and decided to stop, stay, and smile  the best kind of friend is a monster "
"part 1\\i forgot something, but i found it  it seemed like it had changed since i last saw it, but that was only by how i viewed it in relation to me  now i see it every day  it use to be my friend, back then i had none  now i have few  but i can no longer talk to it anymore  it won't talk back "
so shall my foot steps blaze a trail that none will follow 
"my anger that has grown from an encumbered tiredness, as i wrote down a few weeks ago, will be the coal that pushes me forward  i gave this announcement so you would know   it's only fair  don't worry about me  this was really only meant for one person anyways "
"i'm leaving <propfemale>; hopefully this will be a new and better life  time may even let me place my past behind me, at least the bad parts so that i may forget them  i will still <propfemale> my anger with me though  i'm sure of that "
"   to set the fire, and cover your tracks\time will tell,the past laughs last"
i need people to buy my <propmale>  or atleast make a request  thanx 
what do u think about me?
noro
sic transit <propfemale> mundi
my cryptic zenith is far
stressed
lost in thoughts
should i go to senior prom? even by myself?
"i am heaven sent, dont you dare forget  i am all you've ever wanted  what all the other boys all promised  and its all from watching tv, and speeding up my breathing  wouldnt stop if i could  oh,it hurts to be this good "
let me in is actually a pretty sweet movie  sweet as in romance wise  i think it translated itself well also  check it out 
"well   i dont even know what to say, this weekend sucked, tommorow will suck  dont really know what to do now  started another painting   decided im not going to prom  dont have a dat, and its a stupid event anyways "
"i just realized something amazing, i kinda sound like panic at the disco when i sing, i could be a singer  my singing plus my poems would be monster  i guess it could be my back-up, back-up,back-up plan "
i got accepted to         nothing! because i keep forgetting to apply 
so i just did 50 pushups and 50 pull ups in 4 minutes  is that good?
"finished my tribute poem to <propfirst> <propfirst>, sadly i droped my phone in water a few hours later  if u dont know who <propfirst> <propfirst> is u should probably google him "
"im affraid to play my 360 cause if the power goes out and i didnt save, i may throw it out the window in anger  lol"
"im done using facebook for now, its starting to bore me, and it waists my time "
