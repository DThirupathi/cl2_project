"yay for karaoke and fun friends! i had a blast, <propfirst> invited me on a biking trip with him and a bunch of peeps down the or coast, but i dunno    going to have to think about that, but it sounds like fun!"
wonders why some people lie over and over even though their lies clear as cellophane  i loathe people

i am so excited for the new tax season! just going to be sad when its over    that and looking like the devil for a job till the next season! lol 
another sign that the economy is terrible: when you have to be your own psychotherapist because you can't afford a real one and you don't qualify for insurance to get one 
"so i made a goal to lose weight this tax season rather than gain it    so far so good, down two pounds this week, woohoo!"
"my work is doing a food drive for the thurston county food bank, bring in any unopened non-perishable food items and get $15 off you tax prep fee! if you already did your taxes, or don't intend to have us do them, you can still bring some food down to donate  smile  i am at the tumwater <propmale> hewitt office off capitol blvd  or you can bring a donation into any of the other offices in <propfemale>, <propfemale>, and tumwater "

"awe poor <propfirst> asked me to wake him when i got home    i gave him a good half hour before doing so and he tells me that there were guys outside banging around doing construction  sad  anyhow, so back to sleep he went "
"apparently i am the <propfemale> of bad communication skills  i avoid conflict like the plague, i grew up with a lot of violence and don't like to argue, so how on earth do i manage to come off to some as being offensive or rude when i am just trying to be courteous? this is why i am not a social person  i don't do well with others and stuff like this just makes me not want to try "
yay for new breaks  <propfirst> just finished the front    will have him do the back tomorrow
