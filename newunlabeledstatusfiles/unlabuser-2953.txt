"love is a highway; it's not always a two-way street, one often gets run over, and even when faced with such a crippling pain inside, one has to keep quiet out of care for others, knowing that one may not be loved again but one keeps loving on and yet repeatedly gets hurt and hurts others    "

"okay  i'm going to do it  i swear i am  i'll formally ask him out  i swear i will  i will  i'm going to  maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but when i'm ready and it seems he can hear it, i'll ask him to   go our with me  i still find it weird for girl to be asking boy but i'm going to do it! i swear! dang    wish me luck   ?!"
"you know, i wouldn't be so pained if i just    didn't care     but i do   and i wouldn't change that because of the happiness (i've?!) caused others and i don't care how much, how severe the pain, just that they're happy    [that's you guys   and maybe someone else but i feel so used by him   ]"
"lol felt better just talking to him recently    and he knows (should know) that no matter the pain, i love him and he's worth it  he's so amazing    incredible, funny, sweet, thoughtful, sexy     umm yeah not used to it but he is! ^^ (the one i love: on my mind )"
