"you don't see what you possess, a beauty calm and clear\it floods the sky and blurs the darkness like a chandelier\all the light that you possess is skewed by lakes and seas\the shattered surface, so imperfect, is all that you believe\- 'you are the <propfemale>' by the hush sound"
"when i look to the left see his sun tanned hands, his muddy river hair and his thousand-acre plans i'm all shook up like a quarter in a can, ain't life sweet in the passenger seat!"

"there's a girl in my mirror crying tonight, and there's nothing i can say to make her feel all right "
you don't die from a broken heart   you only wish you did
"someday never really comes, does it?"
you don't realize how much you care about someone until they don't care about you
"it's always the same in every relationship, there is always one person crying and wishing to get back together, while the other doesn't even remember the things they've been through  i hate that i have to be the one who remembers every little detail while you can't seem to remember me at all"
"the worst way to love someone is to sit next to them, knowing they don't love you back"
loving someone that doesn't love you is like reaching for a <propfemale> - you know you'll never reach it but you just got to keep trying
love that remains longest in your heart is the one that is not returned
ask me how many times my heart has been broken and i'll tell you to look at the sky and count the stars
"if i never met you, i wouldn't like you  if i didn't like you i wouldn't love you  \if i didn't love you i wouldn't miss you, but i did, i do and i will"
