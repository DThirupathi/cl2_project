"well  finally got a facebook  now will people stop bugging me about it? get myyearbook, i check that pretty often "
its way too early in the morning to be functioning
"sometimes, life just becomes too much  too many things are happening at once and you feel like you're caught in the middle of a cyclone of joy, love, pain, and hate and its never going to end  then, suddenly, the wind dies down and you find yourself motionless, stranded in the middle of no where with no clue how to put your life back together, all the pieces pulled apart by the twister and scattered to the for winds "
today is sunday  yesterday was saturday  tomorrow is    run screaming into the night!!!
"i keep finding dimes  every where i go  my house, my school, the mall, crossing streets  i wonder if there is deep, hidden meaning behind that, or if i have finally given up and gone insane   "
i woke up at 5 am this morning  i am not a morning person  i feel like i am going to keel over at any time 
gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah  ok i feel better now 
"so meany reasons to give up, so few to keep going  do the reasons to continue outweigh the reasons to stop?"
"the reasons i live, in order of importance from least to most: my family, my friends, my video games, my writing, my books, and pie "
i have a confession  i      will tell you eventually 
"life is to complicated, so just live "
"life is too complicated, so just live "
"if you have the time, why not do something constructive? i find it liberating to do without having to be asked that which i normally do not like to do "
"i hate homework, but not as much as i hate being bored  ah, the sacrifices we make "
"if i have to do this damn problem one more time, i will bite the head off the next person who comes near me! if i don't have to do anything for the next twelve years, i will never see the light of day again and will lose all color  if i have to answer another stupid question with the afforementioned answers, you will all suffer my wrath for eternity so stop asking me stupid questions!"
"   it is hot here or is it just me? oh ya, i forgot i fell into a volcano   holy crap, volcano!!!"
oh my god prom was so much fun!!!!
"i feel tortured to the point of insanity, and the one person i want to talk to, i know i can't  i have lost so much that i held so close  i just don't know who i can turn to anymore  when the going gets tough for me, i've run out of luck  i just want to be at peace again, but the steady foundations i had laid out are crumbling down and my fragile house of cards is falling and burying me with an impossible weight "
"life sucks, but so do boys "
"(the newly modified) life sucks, but so does dying"
"hey guys, please don't text or call me, i am on the mainland and i dont want to rack up <propmale> distance minutes (it affects my texts too)"
"hey guys, please don't text or call me, i am on the mainland and i dont want to rack up <propmale> distance minutes (it affects my texts too) p s  thank you to every one who told me happy birthday!!!!! sorry i didnt get on earlier to respond"
"wow, word really got around about ian   i hadn't even changed my facebook status yet   "
i'm sick of it  sick of forgiving  sick of ignoring  i am not going to bother to be angry anymore  i won't hate anymore  it's not worth my time or energy  vague contempt and disgust is all i have left to give 
"i love that moment where you realize that the person you can't stand is throwing a party and inviting all your friends   and because you're the person who always gave them rides, they can't go  smile  ya, that's a good feeling   "
