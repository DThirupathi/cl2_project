"sorry if you get multiple posts, messages, or the same comment repeatedly  my facebook is being weird as hell right now "
somethings come back around 1 time  take that 2nd <propmale>  could be your lucky break  if it comes around a 3rd time you better leap and <propfemale> it because that never happens 
"hmm  slightly confused  nothing unusual  rather happy at this moment tho, very unusual  lol  man i love it "
"looks like you left every memory behind, in the room where we made so many  just got rid of it all  *sigh*"
"cant win  impede on someone else's happiness, and i feel bad  stay silent and i lose  speak and it wont matter, whats the point in any of it "
"i lost something along the way  not quite sure what it is just yet, but something is missing  maybe its a piece of my mind, maybe its something else  either way im missing something, and i miss it significantly "
"intoxicated  it helps  preventing the depression, the frustration, and the aggravation  *sigh* kinda sad in a way "
old habits die hard  some resurface tho  hmmm    
having the time to think is the worst  thoughts of mine are the worst torture  i wish i could forget  i wish i could just move on  i cant tho  i miss things far to much  and what hurts the most is knowing its all my fault 
"one you just called fat? she's been starving herself & lost over 30lbs  the one you just called stupid? he has a learning disability, studies over 4 hours a night  the one you called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on, hoping people will like her  the one you just tripped? he is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  repost if you're against bullying"
things just seem to keep twisting and turning into a complex puzzel my disfigured mind cant seem to solve 
wow     that kinda hurts     
"falling on your face is tough  but you learn not to take that path again, and sometimes end up with a pretty scar  life is tough  youll learn to deal "
"falling on your face is tough  but you learn not to take that path again, and sometimes end up with a pretty scar  life is tough  youll learn to deal "
i dont want to settle  i want what and who i want  just i suck at reaching that  god i wish i could just say what i felt and wanted 
"drama, drama, drama        so fun "
things pass with time  everything will fade out and just become a distant memory as long as you allow it too   consider everything that happened in that memory  and realize how much of it was negative  then just forget 
grrrr     facebook and pvp net are both being gay - -

im doubting tomorrow will be fun in the slightest  ugh  oh well  lets do this shit!!
my motivation is slowly going out the window for alot of things  i need some sort of muse  a drive to give me a reason to keep going  ugh  i hate how my mind works 
"these thoughts hit me like a brick  and then pull me under  they just constantly flow, like water in a siv, ugh  i think i need a hand to pull me back out "
just so frustrating not know if feeling like this is even gonna matter  cant even make a sound for how i feel right now 
intelligence  humor  creativity  deep thought process  and eyes that i like  apparently anyone who meets these things are either a  not interested  or b  out of my league  sometimes both  man its great 
"they pop up every now and then  to tease me maybe? either way i know they take me back where i have already been, which is horrible, because i feel like im losing them again "

"today was interesting  rather good  interesting conversations, and new things approaching  lets see how tomorrow is "
"if i knew how,\i wouldnt stop to think,\id just turn time back,\because believe or not,\you had taken my heart,\from the very start,\but i wasnt even told"
"i think i told you once or twice that i was losing my mind, but you never seemed to listen "
"this is just one of those nights where my head and my heart are actually communicating with one another as opposed to constantly arguing  they came to the same conclusion, and its rather saddening, i wish that things had gone right when i had that <propmale>  but now with it potentially being to late, what do i do from here?"
"things are going well  everything seems to be looking up  yet  im not happy  something is missing  im not sure what it is, but i wish i did  then maybe these other good things would put a smile on my face "
"welp  passed the written test  gotta get my permit, then next month, license time"
"ladies and gentleman, i am gone  great to see how some of you really are and if you cared "
"mr  <propfirst> cuervo your my best friend for tonight  i talk to you, and it brings back memories, and i just reveal more and more to you  isnt it amazing how i feel what i feel, and think what i think?"
