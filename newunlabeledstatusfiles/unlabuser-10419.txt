tna fan interaction was amazing on so many levels  no daff though  bummer  blah   i'm going to focus on the awesome  aj and <propmale>  <propmale>  wolfe  <propfemale>!!!
thought i had my voice back but i wake up today and sound like some old woman who smoked for sixty years 
"discovery channel talking about a snake  \if the victim can get the anti venom within 30 minutes theres a <propmale> of survival\""    holy sh#t balls i am -never- going to austrailia """
i guess i'm not supposed to have my own problems 
still unpacking but   we're here  internet and cell phone reception is less than stellar but we're here!
"we just bought 51 comics - 49 of which were wicked cheap!\cheap as in price, people  not in quality "
"no more comics - i've got plenty enough to read - no figs, no video games  save save save cause comic con is coming to chicago in a little more than one month!"
"if you have a wonderful man who works hard to\take care of you, would do anything for you, makes you laugh, is your\best friend, who wants to grow old with you, will always pick you up\when you are down, who is your world & someone that you are\thankful for, then post this  i love you <propfirst>!"
just finished watching one flew over the cuckoo's nest and cried my eyes out  movies have made me tear up before but i was sobbing at the end of this one 
"resident evil 3d - afterlife was pretty bad ass \trailer for a new saw movie: also in 3d     which might be enough to get me into the series again aaand tron all up in this bitch  erm i'm a little excited about tron "
well  that hurt! pretty sure i broke one of my toes and that the nail is going to fall off another
