i'm in oklahoma        
<propfirst> wants me to tell people that he's my brother and our daddy is our uncle!!
"i saw <propmale> potter!!! it was pretty good  it was the first of the series that was different from the books!! still good, but you can notice the changes if you've read the books!! all in all, fabulous!!!"
"sometimes people just suck, and i guess we have to learn to live amongst those who are perpetually crap!  sometimes, i think that mcalester, ok has more of the perpetually shitty than elsewhere! i just don't know how long i can survive here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
hi          i'm <propfemale> 
"oh my       (any god, who you may believe in) wtf, is wrong with this state               seriously people, oklahoma needs to be it's own nation             this place is soooooo primitive, it's unreal             we need to vote to make ok go away       "
"really, not to harass or anything, but how is it that everyone is on food stamps?? the majority of the people here have no teeth and they buy sodas and <propfemale> with their food stamps (saw it first hand today   simply sodas and <propfemale>) it's very frustrating f"
"i hate this state more than anything in the world, this simply isn't right  we can't even afford to give our very well mannered and educationally advanced daughter a treat  but all these people on food stamps can give their children as much as they wish, "
"why is it that people can buy sodas, <propfemale>, and other non-nutritional items on food stamps? please, if you're an american, write congress and senate   my husband works so hard to provide for us and we're barely breaking even because of all these thieves w"
sometimes i worry about people          
"how is it that my husband is so amazing?  honestly, he's the most amazing person i've ever met!!! i love you <propfirst>, more than you can possibly know!!!"
"i just saw a dog chained up with no food or water, (while i got it some food and water,) what is the matter with people??? i really think these people should suffer the same fate as if they did it to a child  my reasoning is: they keep the dog on a chain, it cannot fend for itself!!! this place is crazy  what kind of human being treats an animal with such disrespect??? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggghhh"
hmmmmmmmmm        
i really think that i love my <propfemale> <propfemale> far more than any human should ever love an animal            
"my dog just woke me up to go outside only to stand and stare               why would she do that          i'll never get back to sleep         regardless, i love her, so i guess it's okay!!!"
"we finally moved, we're now with normal people    the apartment is awesome          "
"i finally got a job, my boss rocks and he's going to literally pay me for my work   i'm working for a grassroots campaign in the effort to clean up mcalester while mcalester may be beautiful      they're a lot of improvements to be made  regardless, i'm super excited and honored to be accepted for this position!!"
my dog thinks she's a cat and my cat thinks she's a dog 
going to work          i really like my new job!
"i am pregnant! pregnant, pregnant, pregnant!"
and my dog farts         
why am i getting a master's again?? tired!
i miss my <propfirst>! a day and a half is too long! <propfirst> haddock
"remeber, all graduate level papers require at least 3 references              i hope a donkey craps in her mouth! i do not care for this professor!!!"
why do people complain when they are offered a free service? i don't get it!
i'm really going with <propfemale> for a girl             just love it!
"my boss just gave me a website to go to written, \accu weather <propfemale> com!\"" he really needs computer classes!"""
work          blah!
warm and toasty by the fireplace      far too cold outside!
i don't care for group assignments much         especially when i get stuck doing the work of 4 people         either that or get a bad grade:{
i had no morning sickness at all this pregnancy  just a few days ago i started getting sick in the evenings          yuck! the first trimester is almost finished         hopefully the vomiting is no more soon!
my baby bump keeps getting bigger then smaller         maybe no pop yet?
poor <propfirst> and kenzi are sick! it looks like the flu but they both had seasonal flu shots  kenzi also had the h1n1 vaccine and she was the first one to get sick           why???? i feel so sorry for them  sad 
this morning as i was walking my dog in the middle of my apartment complex (in the middle of the city) i was almost plowed by a damn cow! then as i was looking for my cow i found half an arm in someone's yard (it was fake but that's not obvious when you're 100 feet from it)  not cool!!! the cops eventually found the cow in someone's driveway 
finally finished       eating then sleeping!!
only 9 more classes until i have a master's degree              if i make it         talk about a booty whoopin'
please vote: which name do you like best? girl:  <propfemale> - poppy  <propfemale>  <propfemale> - <propfirst> <propfemale> - maddy  <propfirst> - lexi boy: <propmale> <propmale>
cold       and rainy
just read teen vogue so i can discuss its role in child development                 blah  oh and it's embarrassing buying a teenage magazine when you're 27        
i have to write this darn paper        
so we're playing uno and i notice <propfirst> slowly moving towards the discard deck with a guilty smirk on his face  he tried to play a stack of 20 cards in one turn            too bad he isn't that slick! busted!!!
i felt my bambino moving!!!!
i want some hummus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it's a boy!!
"having a glass of wine, already in my pjs, and wondering how i'll manage to stay awake until midnight  happy new year!"
i made it      now time to crash!
congrats to nate and <propfemale>! we're so happy for you two   maybe we'll be able to go to the american edition! we miss y'all (this is from <propfirst> too   ha!) 
we're naming the baby bentlee!! i'm so happy and relieved we've finally agreed on a name!!!!!
i'm so ready to meet my little man! we finally bought his swing and bassinet  i've bought him so many little outfits - i love looking at all his <propfemale> clothes! we're waiting to get our assignment to buy his furniture and still researching carseats 
"i had a rough day today, just not feeling well (aches and pains and emotional issues)  <propfirst> made me feel so much better! he's just so sweet that i forgot my back hip head aches  i love my husband!! thank you, <propfirst>!"
we're moving to <propfemale> in june!!!!!
"i had a long day at work, but came home to my beautiful family, a red <propfemale>, and two sweet cards from <propfirst> and kenzi  it's no fun having a late meeting        but my amazing family made up for it!"
third trimester morning sickness???????????????? not fair!
"so, we named our baby boy bentlee                now i've found another name i really like and <propfirst> prefers it too  i don't know if it's too late to change or if we should stick with bentlee  the new name is       presley "
"today was my last day at work! now i'm just gonna be big, unemployed, pregnant woman! woohoo!!!"
my baby girl is 8!!!
my day gets better as soon as <propfemale> comes on!!
psa: there is absolutely no reason to inform a pregnant woman of her current condition  it is also very rude to comment on how huge she is - this is especially true when you are larger than she is and not pregnant  the best idea is to keep your trap shut! thank you 
we have a baby boy!!!!
had bentlee's newborn photos taken this morning         he peed and spit up on the set! very cute pictures!
"i have the most amazing husband  he's super supportive! he should get an award for daddy of the century! i love you, <propfirst>!!"
kenzi is in tulsa on a field trip  it's the first i haven't been on  i can't wait until 4 so i can have some peace of mind  two hours is a bit far for a 2nd grade field trip 
i feel like <propfemale> the cow 
"so   bentlee's nursing, looks at me through the corner of his eye, and gives me an ear to ear smile!! made my day "
bentlee is a month old today!!!
bentlee sounds like a vicious animal when it's time to nurse and he's getting close  then he turns into a sweet baby boy once he gets his milk  babies make some crazy noises    i'd forgotten 
so at 6 smile 0 this morning i gave up trying to go back to sleep  bentlee was cranky  i got out of bed and put the little bean in his swing for a minute to get a couple of things done and he falls asleep        nice 
bentlee's tummy is upset  i wonder if i ate something he doesn't agree with       but i don't remember what i ate yesterday    i eat too much  it's horrible to think i've upset his little tummy     poor guy  sad 
we're getting packed out on wednesday!!! heading for <propfemale> in 8 days!!!
goodbye oklahoma!!
we went to dc today! tiring and fun!!
we've finally found a house!!!!!!
i just paid $50 for nasonex and i feel like i got a good deal     sad 
i am not happy! hopefully this changes soon 
well        no movers today  <propfirst> said they are going to come wednesday  i'm still not happy         but i am much happier than before!
our downstairs looks and feels like home!! now we need to tackle upstairs          
spent the day in dc     heading home!!!
i love my hubby!!!
miss makenzi is so funny! she literally begs us to change bentlee's diaper (which we rarely do)!
taking bentlee to the library for storytime    i hope he likes it (his sister sure does)!
my baby boy is 4 months old today!!!! time flies     
i'm going to throw my phone off a bridge! it not only randomly calls people at all hours (sorry erica)     but now it has decided to randomly like everyone's fb status!!!
"seven years ago today i married my amazing husband!!! i love you, <propfirst>!!"
"<propfirst> and i just got home from a date!!! an actual date       no kids (imagine that)! it was so fabulous!! he is so amazing! i'm so thankful that he's my husband and the father to my children!! <propfirst>, you rock!!"
i do not feel well today! busy
tomorrow is kenzi's first day of third grade      wow! they don't require any school supplies (i spent $1 60 on a pencil box and pencils) and school doesn't start until 9 am  another reason to love <propfemale>!!!!
my baby boy is 5 months old today  sometimes i wish i could stop time for a bit        it's going by too fast!!!!
orange is an awful color       especially when it's burnt!!!!
just loves when her baby boy decides to start the day at 0530        
kenzi threw up at swim practice and held in her mouth until i got to her and pulled her out of the pool     if i were the one swimming there would have been vomit in the pool!
what is the matter with people???
it just won't stop raining       
it is cold!!!
about to take bentlee to get his 6 month shots          not excited 
thanks for the birthday wishes everyone! so sweet! i'm getting the best bday gift this evening      i get to watch my baby girl swim in her first meet! she's going to rock it!!!
super sleepy! kenzi has another swim meet this morning! she's so excited!
finally got a job!!
"so i just looked at my activities and it said 'breastfeeding in public'        yeah, i don't do that for fun or anything, just when necessary     why did it even say that?"
kenzi placed second in the backstroke!
tired      
going to baltimore in a few hours to pick up <propfirst>! i can't wait to see him!!
"my poor baby girl spilt soup on her leg last night  we took her to the er  it looks like everything will be fine, but it was a pretty nasty burn (2nd degree)  i've got to clean and redress it this morning          i hope it looks and feels better, but something tells me it won't  on a bright note, the er in chambersburg is fabulous! everyone was super nice and we were in and out in an hour!"
"<propfirst> thought bentlee might be constipated         so he proceeds to feed him an entire jar of prunes  mom and i agreed that <propfirst> is on diaper duty for the next 24 hours!! good luck, husband!!"
my kiddos make me so happy!
kenzi got first in 50 free!
cleaning days are the days i miss having a <propfemale> apartment 
bentlee is getting his two front teeth for christmas! they popped through this morning!
bentlee finally decided to start crawling!
it's snowing   a lot!!! i think i'm about to learn a little about <propfemale>'s winters 
"bentlee woke up about 80 times last night! <propfirst> and i are patiently waiting for him to sleep through the night, maybe when he's 30    who knows at this point! kenzi has a swim meet in lancaster today  warm up starts at 3   so we should get home sometime in the middle of the night, blah "
"well, we're not going to lancaster anymore  it's supposed to snow again "
when i get numerous emails for a law school asking me to apply it sends up some pretty big     red flags   are these seats supposed to be coveted or something?
my mom tricked me   she asked me to go to wal-mart   i reluctantly agreed  now bentlee and i are patiently waiting for her outside of some damn thrift store!
"so, i made kenzi clean her bathroom this afternoon  we had an interesting dialogue   \kenzi annoyed mommy"," can i mop the floor?\""\"9190282ec2c7bd58759460cf70c3767e,it is cold!!!
this weather is nasty! i want <propfirst> to come home!
we have so much snow and it's snowing again  i think we'll be buried soon     i'm ready for summer!
i put bentlee to bed (in his crib) at 8 last night - he slept until 7 smile 0 this morning! awesome! last night was the first time in almost ten months that my boobs were off duty! progress
