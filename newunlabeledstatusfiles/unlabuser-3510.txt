"how did so many people end up with feb bd's?  both my parents, <propfemale>, dr, <propmale>, lots of new babies born here this month the list goes on  wink "
i'm finally getting to my computer--some of you may want to know the babies that are to be born in june are boys! love  love 
"we took <propmale> to sazon's for dinner--our first visit there--worth it, but sadly, no vegetarian fare  wink "
<propmale> is on his way back home   i will miss him--but <propfemale> will really miss him the most :' smile * kiss 
"there's nothing quite like waking up with the bed vibrating because harper is having a seizure--and then also realizing that <propfemale> is \dreaming of running after bunnies\"" and she is running in place  annoyed """
"beer, but it's not recognized  kiss "
so after running the hounds this morning i slept all afternoon--guess i needed the rest 
this wasn't snow that i removed tonight--it was white rain--very heavy 
"if i could figure out how to paste something it would be a lot easier to share this very important message:  tip of the day:  rather than using a shampoo in the shower that adds extra volume and body try <propfemale> detergent which dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove  (thanks <propfemale>, and then <propmale>   )"
i love the snow--but it was so wonderful to be out running the dogs in sunshine today!
wow--i awoke to all the news about a tsunami about to hit--but it looks like it has slowed--if one hits sf area i know that <propmale> will have a good view from is office window 
<propfemale> scared me yesterday by having trouble moving her hind end--as when she had her spinal injury   today she is running and barking at the wind--her usual self 
just a reminder--turn your clocks forward   and lose sleep for several days 
what an absolutely glorious day--too bad i'm not doing some gardening!
today is as dreary as yesterday was beautiful 
"sometimes google is just too funny   i want to see what's out there to change the contour of the church pew so that i don't have this knife pain in my hip   i know how to stretch, i know therapies that are working, i know more than i care to know--but google has brought up every scheme available including how to find a church   gaia does have a seat that reminds me of the toy we bought for <propfemale> "
thanks--the dogs and i needed that 
good morning!
good-bye <propfirst>   you are already missed 
"i did a \spring\"" walk thru of my garden   i don't think my roses made it--they look pretty sad-but it's early   many of my garden goodies look great   it helps that i've been planting native varieties """
   and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever
