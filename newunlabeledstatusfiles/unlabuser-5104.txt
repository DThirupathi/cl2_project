"is wide awake after waking up and realizing that <propfirst> was already ten minutes late for work and was still fast asleep in bed  i know that he's exhausted but how does he manage to sleep through not one, but three different alarms?"
"not sure if this is bad or not, but considering that i laughed my ass off i can't really reprimand her for it  i was watching this movie called death race with <propfemale> and there was a really big e playful losion in it, <propfemale> takes a step back and say's \ holy shit!\"" """
gives great advice  when certain people don't listen to my advice they tend to fuck up  why can't they be bothered to swallow their pride and listen to a voice of reason?
