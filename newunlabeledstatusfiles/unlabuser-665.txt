"changing my creative direction   i put the paint brushes away and started my writing endevours  i plan to have my book done within the next couple months, we'll see   "
i feel envy and lonliness creeping over me    why is it that someone as evil and messed up as my ex finds someone and is going on 4 day trip with them when i can't even get a decent friendship going with a girl??? sullen is the flavor of the day i guess   
"trial by fire    i think i'm gonna pound some weights and go for a serious run tonight, i've let the dust of the last couple holiday weeks settle on me and its time to knock it off, lol"

welcome to my lifestyle obsession    
"if we are all gonna die anyway shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now? you know, i'd like to quit thinking of the present, like right now, as some minor insignificant preamble to something else   "
"i nestle into pain, hug suffering, caress every ache - i play dead, it stops the hurting    "

"life has been a wild ride for the past couple months  it's time to slow down, reflect and brace for the future    "
"i have a sledgehammer in my heart, and i found it when i was your age   "
i've put on my mental war paint and ready for another week of clashing swords and gnashing teeth    pause for the battle cry     
as the optimism washes over me and i feel it soak into my pores i have this strange urge to laugh at my former pessimism    
"maintaining the upbeat is tough when people keep trying to change your tune - time to focus on the right channel, and dial it in    "
"little less than 2 hours before i'm san <propfirst> bound    i best start the drinking immediately upon arriving at the airport to prevent any possible upset of my zen, haha   "
"i'm resting in a lush garden within my mind - the only remaining spot still completely free from outside stresses and let downs, please don't wake me   "

"no more loose ends, all the snakes of this dry, <propfirst> desert have been washed away  its time to bury my guns in the ground and retire my lust for justice  the red tan of the summer has set in and the wide open road stretches out in front of me   "
"things are easy, when you don't know betta, if you think it's sleezy then write it in a short letter     the hardest button to button"
"when i grow up - i want to live near the sea, crab claws and bottles of rum   i put my soul into what i do - i've never liked that sad look   from someone who wants to be loved by you"

"she's got sunset on her breath now, i inhaled just a little bit - now i've got no fear of death now   "
"she slinks down slowly, letting the blistering water in the tub rise around the contours of her skin  the water in every cell of her body awakens to the touch of the water surrounding her, as if they were reuniting with long lost friends  as her stress ascends with every billow of steam, i sit thinking to myself only a couple <propmale> away  before i closed my eyes, i whispered to the <propfemale>, â€œiâ€™m intrigued by herâ€¦ â€�"
