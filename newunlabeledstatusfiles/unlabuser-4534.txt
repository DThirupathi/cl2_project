i can't believe that concert lasted for 2 and a half hours  way too long
"i know what you are thinking, the same thing everyone else is thinking  the truth is that i don't care  people don't understand it but that is just the way it is, sometimes i just don't care "

"s twice, law abiding citizen, head of state, hitch,\ and the first two \episodes of the tester whilst completing assignments for cpd101 and \eng101 and \answering questions on blurtit (very sarcastic"

nothing like doing the macarina (or however you spell it) at the hangout
"i am a robot <propmale>, they call me mechbear"
i wish i could feel bad about myself right now    but that`s not fair to the people who actually have problems  i`m just a stupid teenage boy with stupid teenage boy problems
home

oh my gosh summer needs to end  im bored beyond all reason  something about having so much time with nothing to do just sort of sucks

"morning everybody  i think last night might have been a little too fun, that video is going to be very funny  and the pictures, looking forward to seeing them"
"watching avatar and playing maplestory, a good day "
time to watch scary movies all by myself in my room until i fall asleep

i forgot how much i love playing my bass guitar
going up to my sisters  yay not being home bored
i have to pee
status update- i no longer have to pee
"registration today  my excitement is difficult to control  (read, registration today  at least i have something to do)"
"bored  hungry  kinda wish i was at band camp, but screw that  need to do something productive other than clean, not that i have done any cleaning  gotta come up with a replacement class for ap <propfemale> and possibly chem "
tired  bed  soon 
stuff to do tonight and tomorrow  3 <propfemale> paper due tomorrow  haven't started  better get cracking
fun weekend  by fun i mean i did a lot of work  installing a 40 square foot window is no joke 
i have an idea  and there it goes  where do my unspoken thoughts end up? i keep a lot of things to myself and so much so that i can't possibly store them all    so where do they go? some place nice i hope 
gotta get me some beastly crazy shoes  something weird and unique 
"need a haircut, any suggestions on what kind of style i should go for?"
"oh dude, mr  hebda looks just like <propfirst> fator!"
"so i was all like yeah whatever, i'm going to bed  and then i was all like but i'm not even tired  so i told myself to shut up and get some sleep and then got on facebook despite myself "
almost done with my eng102 final paper  ugh i want it to be over! this is so boring
and my paper is finished  anyone want to read it for me?
off to az mills to get some shoes
i didnt get a bendy straw  sad

hungry  bored  english homework  i don't want to do it 
everything is different now  i don't want to go back but i'm getting tired of looking forward  why is it so hard to just live for the day?
thirsty  ctan test was pretty whack (dictionary for a vocab test? someone wasn't paying attention hehehe) i need to get that schedule fixed! not worried though  no homework til tuesday so i'm going to chill tonight 
"i guess i missed the part where a brand new counselor pulls more weight than the principal, the head of the gifted education department, and our school's gifted program teacher  what is so hard about taking me out of english? i wish people weren't so stupid "
is it just me or did the weekend last longer than the first week of school?
"week 2 and this time they better not screw up my schedule, i will seriously start something"
pretty bored  the school system is so screwed up  i don`t know if i can stand another day in ap <propfemale>
by <propmale> decree ms  jimenez will now be replaced with a rock 
anybody interested in donating to one wheeled productions to help us with our first ever feature length film?
time fo school  still in english  ugh  whatever  ill just deal with it for now 
so i think i'm going to the scrimmage tonight  any one else going?
"well that was a bit discouraging  but i found this verse- <propfirst> 24:13 'but he who endures to the end will be saved \ i just have to keep going"""
"trying to impress a girl by being someone you aren't is like trying to buy happiness, it doesn't work  so the only route is sincerity, but what can you do if that doesn't work either? it would seem you can't do anything except give up and move on  no, this time that isn't an option "
"this day isn't going exactly where i wanted to go, i'm going to let some steam off playing just cause 2  i hope tonight is still fun even with the extra people"
and i can't even pretend i don't care
i don't think i could go a day without talking to you    and i don't want to find out lol
i hate that i wasted this day
"today is going to be so much better than yesterday  breakfast with my mom and <propfirst>, lunch at my grandparents  it will be nice"
"yeah there i go making more stupid decisions  i think too much  whatever, i'm just going to stick with it because stupid or not it is the decision i made "
"i am done messing around with all this  love or not i can't devote my energy this way  there is no one else for me, none but jesus  i need to get back to that mind set and forget about everything else "
god is so amazing  as soon as i typed those words i felt better  even my physical pain has numbed  i knew today was going to be a good day 
i love sitting at my grandparents and listening to my dad and gma talk about economics 
mmmmm procrastination  i'm totally doing my apush essay and notes tomorrow
"hahaha school is so sweet this year  literally no homework except apush  just started the notes like an hour ago and i am halfway done  that essay will take not long at all so i've decided to do it tomorrow, or maybe even wednesday  the only real question is what should i do with all my free time before my clubs and bowling start taking it up?"
that didn't last long at all! time for a homework break! haha i am sooooo lazy
finished my notes finally  thank you <propfirst> and <propfemale> for helping me procrastinate!
man i am so bored  somebody should text me or something because im just sitting in my room doing nothing
finally brought my amp home so instead of being bored i can jam on my bass  smile 
i guess i should start my essay   
so here i am  here i am with all my epic epicness  you're welcome 
"finished my essay  i'm hungry    whatever  i'm just going to shower and go to bed, i'm tired of being awake"
yeah!
i want to go bowling like so bad right now
"i hate the crappy compaq desktop i have at my dads house, the video card cant run crap  was up til 5 tinkering with that hunk of junk but it still sucks "
out of english and probably in to weight training lol  nice switch i guess 
"ah pandora, how i love thee"
anyone going to arizona storm tonight?
"guess i'm not going  sad  oh well, i'll go saturday"
"this is high school my friends, drama isn't just an elective, it is a graduation requirement"
today i found out how truely far i would go for a klondike bar
"no one can get all of these  i am just too awesome  fullname:____ age:__ birthday:____ eye color:___ nickname:___ color:___ favorite food:___ favorite person(s):___ favorite thing to do:___ try, i dare you "
so i either need more friends or a hobby that doesn't suck because this is the second day in a row i have been stuck home during the day with nothing to do  i wish places were hiring so i could get a freaking job and actually do something useful with my time
"almost forgot to do apush, i better hop right on it"
"today i bent the truth to be kind, and i have no regret, for i am far surer of what is kind than i am of what is true  ~robert brault"
"nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending- <propfirst> robinson"
"oh my gosh, greatest quote ever!!! â€œ-you can't just turn on creativity like a faucet  you have to be in the right mood  -what mood is that? -last-minute panic â€� i love it!"
i just want to drive to nowhere and watch the stars with you forever
the magic of the stars that dance across the sky and the beauty of the full <propfemale> as it sits high above could not compare to that moment when our eyes first met
time to study for apush
thats enough studying for now  i'm going to my room to watch bones on netflix
now i feel confident enough to say that i will fail the apush test today 
"kind of worried now, not about me though  hope everything is okay "
me  you  bed  now  on second thought    forget about you  me  bed  now 
     bones  season 2  i'm watching it  yes  awesome 
woah  its saturday night  i donÂ¿t have school tomorrow  yay  kind of 
see you at the pole is tomorrow morning! at vg it starts at 730 by the flag poles in front of the office 
hey if you aren't doing anything tonight and can round up $3 you should go see my <propmale> <propmale> and his band play at the gym sports bar and grill!!!!!!
time for a little social e playful eriment
i understand school spirit but in my opinion it is actually destroyed by the internal competition between the classes  it defeats any sense of camaraderie shared by the school as a whole and makes it nearly impossible to actually act civil to one another  real school spirit should be shared not fought over 
disappointment 
youll never believe what bus is in front of me on my way to the bowling ally  the maxim bus 
"tried to change my birthday to tomorrow just to see what would happen, turns out you have to be 18 to change your birthday  that rules seems a bit strange and arbitrary "
i just watched the entire firefly collection (minus the 2 hour premiere and 2 hour movie based on the show) with my mom
desperate housewives season premiere!
hmm    i'm thinking about what to say here that would get people interested and talking because facebook is so lame when people aren't talking to each other  i know!          i'm pregnant! discuss 
"guess who is going to see young frankenstein live at the gammage tonight! that's right, this guy "
"<propmale>'s facebook comment of the day- \justin bieber? that pretty little singer? personally i think she has a wonderful voice \"""""

"burning guitar hero 6  if this works i am going to be so excited! already modding my copy of brawl, hope it turns out awesome!"
brawl mod faster! guitar hero burn faster! me download more games faster! gahhhh! overload of awesome!!!
"brawl + is good to go and plays fine  haven't been able to boot guitar hero yet, i'll try once more and then i'm off to bed "
well there goes that freaking waste of time  its for the best i guess but still makes me feel like crap
"from now on if i ask a question and you donÂ¿t want to hurt my feelings with your answer, say it anyways  i can deal with the truth, i canÂ¿t deal with lying"
my copy of call of duty modern warfare for the wii works  hopefully it can keep me preoccupied so i dont think about what happened  new desperate housewives
i think women should stop screwing themsleves over by getting with douchebags  there are two benefits to this- women get hurt less and the dbag population drops
want to go back to tennessee  like right now  casa grande just isn't really the place for me  needless to say i will not be making a home here 
pandora totally gets me
"so everyone at vista voted for me for <propmale> class <propmale> right? right? no? it's cool, i wasn't planning on going to the dance anyways  the nomination was nice though"
somebody have a green shirt i can borrow?
hippie day? i think i will wear jeans and a t-shirt 
aw hail lol
"attention casa grande cougars! i have the lid of a sousaphone case that says 'pride of casa grande' in big yellow letters and has a cougar painted on it  it is a little torn up but if someone wants it, let me know!"
here is hoping that my copy of guitar hero nightwish works
i have come to the conclusion that boyfriends have one job and one job only  that is to make their girlfriend feel beautiful every single day 
bon fire dancing was legit  gunna try and go to home coming  i love dancing <2legit2quit>
there are videos and pics of me getting crunk and they will be up over fall break!
and i got all sweaty so i will be taking a shower and i guess i'll just pray i remember chapter 8 because i am not rereading it   good night everybody  hey! any vg girl who doesn't have a date to homecoming! i'm willing to drop the extra $5 to help someone get in as my 'date' so just message me if you're interested 
spartans brought home a sweet varsity win! flirting with another college girl and crashing at eriks rounds out the night  still no date for the dance  sad 
gunna make a frankenstein's monster out of about three old comps  hopefully i can get something that vaguely resembles a working machine though i think i will need a new video card 
"dance was cool i guess  think i liked the bonfire a bit better  oh well, had fun with friends  i'm starving  thinking shower then bed though"
having fun with <propmale> and <propfirst>  thinking about heading to 7-11 here in a minute
i bet if i sat down and just thought right now i could come up with some crazy awesome thing to say  but i can't sit for too long 
"only through the unending perseverance of the spirit can we hope to survive the daily struggle of life  we will only reap what we sow so i will sow only love and good faith  i will tend to these seeds with the spirit and they will grow into a bountiful harvest  it is thus through the spirit that any prosperity, material or otherwise, can be made "
so  tired  but i need to practice my tuba before band practice because i haven't played in months 
my purple stuff shirts are here!! i'm wearing the polo to my band practice tonight!
never actually listened to that song handlebars until just now  i like it
"just saw a pic of bieber at target  no lie, if she were straight id get with her  i dont like her haircut tho, kinda butchy for me  <2legit2quit>"
"hey band kids, i found this amazing shirt- http annoyed  www zazzle com drum_corps_marching_band_but_im_on_my_dot_tshirt-235992616665596400\and these freaking insane shoes- http annoyed  www zazzle com drum_corps_marching_band_keds_black_gold_shoes-167735464913793263\the shoes are black and gold but you can customize them to any colors you want "
"so i realized something earlier and meant to post it  it seems to me that there are only two reasons to strive to be a great man  the first and foremost reason is obviously to bring <propfemale> to god, for without him there is no us  the second reason is to attract a great woman, for without them there is no future "
"im a good guy right? i mean i know i have my faults, but come on  who doesnt? i try my best     <2legit2quit>"
tired  bored  fall break was sorta a bust  a bunch of fun stuff happened but for some reason i feel like i didn't do anything at all  maybe it's because i ended the week the same way i started  was hoping something would have changed  oh well 
looking forward to all the fun letters since i filled in 'military technologies and applied sciences' as the <propmale> i'm interested in on the psat  combat systems engineering ftw 
will you be the pepper potts to my <propfirst> stark?
the new reebock easy tone commercial has more booty than a rap video
"the society is established and running smoothly  all those interested in membership should send me a message  be warned, once you join you can only leave once "
"so apparently im a cute, funny, smart, good christian boy that no girl wants to get with  is it my hair? because ill get it cut "
i should go read the apush chapters
"like my satus and i'll tell you   \1  something i've leatned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds \2  the color you remind me of \3  my first memory of you \4  the animal you remind me of\5  ask something i've always wondered about you 6  my favorite thing about you\7  challenge you to repost this "
i wish school didnt get in the way of learning
are you ready for the social revolution?
it would be so easy if i just didn't care  curse me and my emotions 
-are you sure about this? -the data seems so support the hypothesis  -never  argue  with  the data 
"be honest! if you think i'm cute, like this status  if you love me, put a ?   if i'm your friend, put a  smile   if you ever wanted to go out with me or do right now poke me  if you miss me, put a  annoyed   if you've ever had a crush on me message me saying so  if you're not scared, post this as your status"

"is today \a) friday\b) friday\c) friday\d) friday\e) all of the above\the correct answer is c "
i don't like that pic of me  oh well  it is staying up until i get a pic of my haircut    which i haven't gone to go get yet 
"confused, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so bad, you know?"
so i am writing a short story and i want to give it this really sad ending  well it is kind of happy but mostly sad  everyone i've talked to says they want a happy ending but i don't think that is realistic  bad things happen to good people and i want to capture that idea  what do any of you think?
"so i made a twitter account  i will probably use it quite often, i hate myself lol"
i just realized how much i miss sousaphones 
hypothetical situation- i return to union next year  discuss 
and now im up and cant fall asleep  its probably because of the throbbing pain in my stomach and head 
wow i feel good about today 
"the beauty of your eyes is seen not through happiness, but through the deepest of sorrows, when the glistening tears reflect the true nature of your spirit"
hey it is the 31st of october! you know what that means?? i do! church  also the guys and dolls out at cac and only one week til convention!!!! wooooooo!!
i really want to learn how to write with my right hand  that way i can show off by doing calculus in one hand and writing poetry in the other  at the same time 
boring test all day + stuck at school for an extra hour because my mom's car broke down + not much time with <propfemale> hernandez = a pretty crappy day
about to leave for relay for life
"watching <propmale> potter and the sorcerers stone  goodness the nostalgia  man i grew up with these kids, it is crazy to think that i was that young when this movie came out "
movie was awesome  being stranded in the parking lot    not so much 
something about the late night dull hum of rigs driving down the freeway just calms me down  i feel like i almost belong here 
man if i were to say even half of the things i think      is it better to please with a locked mind or be honest with an open one?
<propmale> is awesome 
"dude, <propmale> bowls! too legit to quit "
"no matter how hard i scream in my head, no one ever hears it  maybe that makes it easier on others    but it doesnt help me "

i don't suppose anyone has season 3 of <propmale> that i can borrow? stupid netflix won't instant stream and i don't feel like waiting for my torrent of season 3 to finish   
one of the marching bands in the parade was playing poker face  that=win  plus their cadence was pretty legit  i wonder who it was
its one of the middle schools    must either be cactus or villago  anyways props to whoever it was 
"hey you! yes, you! if you enjoy onewheeldproduction videos you should really subscribe  it would make us happy "
"so im watching home alone 2, and there is a part where <propfirst> says- this is the best accident of my life  i couldnt help but think- what about your <propfemale>?"

"so i just took the chapter 9 through 16 practice tests and averaged about a 95%, i think i'm ready for this stupid final "
"just did 9-12 this morning, all a's, i've got this "
"who got a 100% on the apush final? that's right, this guy "

if there is one thing i love about arizona it is the weather  it is beautiful outside 
"if you're in the cg area and are going to buy fireworks, stop by one of our two locations- phantom fireworks, in the albertons parking lot on <propfemale> and out in the mall between <propfemale>'s and <propfemale> garden  we are gunna be open all week long so stop by and pick up so fireworks!"

if you are planning on getting fireworks this year you need to come get them from me  im out at the mall between mimis cafe and <propfemale> garden 
fun afternoon planned- hopefully it all works out
"the greatest man in history, jesus, had no servants, yet they called him master, had no degree, yet they called him teacher, had no medicines, yet they called him healer, had no army, yet kings feared him, won no military battles, yet he conquered the world, committed no crime, yet they crucified him  he was buried in a tomb, yet he lives today  re-post if you believe in your heart he is the reason for the season"
"when the time is right it will not be our mind that says jump, but our heart that leaps into the moment "
to be a slave to your spirit is to truly be free 
"every little thing she does is magic  a good song  also, coincidentally, and amazing status update "
