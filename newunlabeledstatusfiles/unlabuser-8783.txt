well that was an interesting *achem* adventure    
leaves colorado (cry) for <propfemale> (horray) on sunday!
made it    alive    sort of   
"will have a great time, tortured granted, in debate    very interesting people  i fit right in!"
loves debate! i'm so psyched about the topic and the argument style and the new lingo and and and everything!
debate people spread the info - <propfemale> debate 2009 institute fb group 
"wait    <propfemale> debate institute 2009    i got it backwards, sorry "
loves <propfemale>! especially convo     caner is awesome! (add inflection)
"is tired and excited for friends to get in tomorrow  wow, hit school running, that's for sure!"
"loves <propmale> grey tea, friends, <propfemale> especially, and <propfemale>  god is good  (humidity sucks, though) "
my head hurts - its too smart for my own sanity!
has become nocturnal 
is going to jujitsu and tae kwon do back to back tonight - about time for martial arts!
is 4 and 0 at gsu debate tournament!
is excited about clarion! pray for <propfemale> debate!
"has decided that this weather could not be more beautiful    for <propfemale>, that is "
"loves richmond university campus - absolutely beautiful! fun debates, too "
desperately needs to turn debate off from the mind! too much!
is bored of her profile picture    i want a cool martial arts one like <propfemale> and <propfemale> and <propfemale> and <propfirst>!
so many pictures! busy busy doing admin for <propfemale> tkd  enjoy!
crazy frog! stuck in my head because of the rediculous little ninja    
sigh  life is so busy! then again i wouldn't have it any other way   
masochistic martial artist in a meloncholy mood    poor lenn 
"sigh  surrounded by good friends, fascinating classes and a whirlwind of stress  so time for a break, (thank you god for thanksgiving!) but life is how it should be "
going home soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
home!
snow!
freedom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
has discovered she is scared for life    she will never be able to brush her teeth with anything other than her left hand!
mischevous 
is honored to be part of the <propfemale> debate family - and very proud of them!
snow! i'm going to start wearing snowflake jewelry more often     laugh  coloradan is happy 
ph - really?! we're 'learning'ph! *weeps in boredom*
snow  *far away e playful ression of absolute joy*
"i have decided that if you are bored and don't have to schedule study time around friends, you need more awesome  friends "
"lost at hearts, but lenn lund didn't win, so its all ok!"
loves working in the psych department with <propfemale> yoshino     we've found our true home!
"god works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose - especially with snow days!"
"ok, so i have to admit something that shocked me - <propfemale> weather impressed me! the snow has a wonderfully mystical sheet of ice on top of it, an absolutely fascinating phenomenon to the coloradan      what wonders associated with the frozen liquid we so take for granted "
"will be working on nuclear necromancy for the next many weeks, probably to the detriment of extensive scholastics "
"just played key board  ::grin of bliss:: how frustrating! it sounds terrible, feels terrible, and makes me homesick - and it was so awesome! <propfemale> yoshino made my week, at least!"
has missed martial arts in the extreme!
"random fun quote of the day: \the medical people in this group are going to have melancholy heart attacks at impossible maladies \"""""
"my life really doesn't vary that much - homework, masochism (either due to debate or martial arts), and attempts at sleep  then there's the friends: they make the world spin round "
"thought: life could be boiled down to moment by moment healing, in any number of forms, and we either help or harm that healing  college doesn't really condone health "
absolutely hates growing up 
is praying for adare discher 
adores her friends!
"oh my goodness, convicting melancholy quote! \worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow; it empties today of its strength \"" -<propfemale> ten boom"""
loves hebrews 6:7    a message for college students 
"has decided she adores the breeze! the gentle play on the hair, the sound of the rustling in trees, pulling the drying helicopters along the sidewalk, cooling the scorching heat from the sun all sum to a promise of a moment of peace in contrast to the sounds of planes overhead, construction in the distance, stressed college students bustling from one air-conditioned class to the next "
is in a 'wondering' mood   
loves three part staff!
stuffed her head too full of information  now the brain is holding it all captive until it receives sleep and a vacation - neither of which can be granted before teachers demand the information regurgitated on their tests  ug 
two weeks and i'm home!
"1 <propfirst> 4:7-11~ \the end of all things is near   \"""""
yeay! super excited! pandora just stumbled upon one of my favorite all time theme songs ever: lux aeterna!
"me: \maybe i'm just a freak \""  <propfemale> yoshino: \""i thought this was already a forgone conclusion \"""""
i would love to talk to you until kingdom come    but i guess we can just talk for eternity after that 
"loves her dear stalker mom, babs st ! praying for recovery and can't wait to see you!"
wow! forgot i had so much fun stuff in my boxes    stalker mom sent more than i realized!
apathy is strong with this one
