living in the moment has its benefits  love  passion  you feel like youre walking on air   to feel something so strong so powerful for the first time in my life and its a thrill  so my advice to you live your life without remorse or regrets  it maybe scary but at like thats part of the roller coaster  highs and lows  twists and turns  i generally enjoy the loop 
"sometimes id like to make it rain so i could erase the pain  the regrets that eat me up inside tell me that im alive  im alive  id like to think im well but my luck turns with the flip of a switch  sometimes i wish things werent so difficult and i could forget about all the bad things,these scars remind me who i am at the end of the day  and now when i look in the mirrior i can say im happy  not pefect  blessed"
sleepless tonight  work from 8-4 smile 0! too many thoughts keeping me awake  if he only knew how much i love him  baby how could i take you for granted?  sad 
"\i guess its gonna have to hurt  guess im gonna have to cry & let go of somethings i loved to get to the otherside  guess its gonna break me down like falling when youre trying to fly  its sad but sometimesmovin on with the rest of your life starts with goodbye \""-carrie understand """

cheers* to my dad because without you i wouldnt be the person i am today  i love you so much  thank you for the life lessons  the hard times and all the laughter thats healed all the wounds  you are the best dad; i love you 
everyone says love is hard but what we're really missing is somepart of ourselves that we arent letting go  our insecurities are the only things that hold us back in life well no longer is life about failure its about dedication  my heart is his but my mind is mine but my love is unconditional 
just cant seem to stay mad at anyone but myself  how messed up is that? spent way too much time blaming myself for what i cant change  and people call me perfect but the only thing ive perfected is being someone who isnt good enough  and if you think im perfect im just gonna laugh in your face because thats just not me

"today has been one of those days that where you know you should e playful ect the une playful ected,but you don't know how that that shock until it's staring right at you   it leaves you in a state of a caution  vulnerability  and a slight sense of inconfidence  rip  grandpa <propfirst> 12 26 09 you are missed more than you know "
"everything happens for a reason  maybe thats the gut-feeling that e playful lains why you found me & i fell so hard for you  the feeling are so raw, so pure and my love is true  just wanted the world to know how amazing my man is, i love you devan "
this past weekend has been horrific!  case and point i don't need to e playful lain in drastic detail of the last few days  first of all i can't stand people who can't drive  stay off the road! second   i hate drama  and last but not least   i'm completely sick of mindless drones who hate their lives  guess it's time to move on & turn some negatives into positives 
thanks to kevkev <propfirst> i would make a really good spouse    well can't try if not given the <propmale> lol  i know i'd be an awesome wife! lets hope my man does   jkjk

"life is crazy, people are mentally unhinged and in the mist of it all we are always caught in between transitions  if you believe in fate, love and hope that everything will turn out ok then why worry so much  i've spent my whole life worrying bout what i cannot change & we should all learn to cope with life's une playful ectantcies & make our own happiness  that's what life's all about"

sometimes you gotta let the good things happen and work together on evacuating the bad out of your life  then you can be completely and truly happy before you take that step  3 days baby love you!
"moved into our place yesterday and with it being two wonderfully exciting exhausting days  time to relax , unwind and hope i get part-time at <propfirst>'s soon  love you babe (so glad we have our own place) you are amazing "

"with my baby, chrissie and <propmale>! yay! work at 6 night"
its taken years to find peace and <propfemale> in my life  its not about being selffish  ecentric  or complete oblivious after all this time you realize you cant change people  their actions or anything else  all you can do is live your life no matter how young they say i am for being engaged  in reality it doesnt matter what anyone thinks  we're not kids anymore but we are still growing at every age 
"got home from work    (ugh!!) time for crunches, push-ups  laundry  cleaning  & then finally a shower after a hectic day at a coffee-shop  text me  hopefully hanging out with people later  hit me up!!!"
