upset but don't worry about it i'll work it out myself
"there are two wolves fighting in every mans heart:their names, love and hate "
"i was blindfolded, but now i'm seeing my mind was closing, now i'm believing i finally know what just what it means to let someone in to see the side of me that no one does or ever will so if your ever lost and find yourself all alone i'd search forever just to bring you home, here and now this i vow i'd come for you-nickleback"

"yet again i break another shock and must fix the piece although i'm sure it  will break again   also i am    ? whats the phrase      pissed off, yes thats it, pissed off at whats happening in my life when god almighty knows that i did nothing wrong, nothing at all but it still feels like i'm being punished   all in all this is the third worst day in my life   count them, think about it "
"well, i'm working out the kinks in my life and i'm moving on to bigger and better things "
"it's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right  i hope you had the time of your life  : ) hears to life "
"live life to the fullest, because if you don't you never know what will happen or what could have happened  so i've decided to change for the good of myself and i'm liking it so far  ; )"

there is nothing they can do to help me
"tired and have nothing to do, damn college is great ?(in a sarcarstic tone)"
"i feel like there is no need for conversation, some questions are better left without a reason, and i would rather reveal myself than my situation, now and then i consider, my hesitation, the more the light shines through me, i pretend to close my eyes, the more the dark consumes me, i pretend i'm burning,  burning bright"
"have you ever had one of those days where things seem fine but everything is actually going wrong, well  for me today is one of those days and it doesn't want to end  : |"
"first i get a power steering leak then antifreeze starts coming from no where what is happening top my poor car, wtf? oye, today sucks "
