"things you should not lie about in a relationship  *your name   *your age   *if your married   * do you believe in god or somethin else   *and if you got kids  i think these are the basics  all the other details are important too, but these basic things lay the ground on if you even wanna be in a relationship with that person or not "
1st day back to work today after being off 10 days    ugh    i need 10 more days  better yet i wish i could just be a stay at home mom again
