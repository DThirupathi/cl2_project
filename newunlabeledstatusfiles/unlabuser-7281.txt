i'm taking my driving test tomorow  i may puke 
"jesus christ in a hand basket, i passed!"
my one beading needle broke and bam! there goes my plan for the night 
i have a question  what the hell does it mean when you poke some one on face book? i'm rather confused 
i don't know if i should be happy that i got into a math class or upset that its at eight o'clock     saturday morning  mother of god 
"e playful loding dog balls, inconsiderate customers and almost losing all my classes  jesus, marry and <propfirst> its been one of those days "
so i guess i'm baby sitting the cedar <propmale> gallery from twelve till about four o'clock tomorow  some body should come visit me at some point 
so if any one tried to get a hold of me since sunday night my phone has been out  but its working now so you should try again  smile 
can any body help a sister out and tell me if you know of any cheap cell phone plans with unlimited talk? i've never had anything but a track phone and i have no damn idea where to even start looking 
i am officially charging my real working cell phone  i lost my phone charger for my other phone so people should re-give me their number or out of celebration give them to me for the first time 
now i have bad reception  fuck my life 
what do young people do for fun on a tuesday night?
"no to same-sex marriage? let me get this straight: <propfirst> <propmale> is on his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> might getting married for a 9th time, <propfemale> spears had a 55 hour marriage, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods, while married, were having sex with everyone; and yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage? repost to your <propfemale> if you are proud to support equal rights for all!!!"
"oh rain, why must you temporarily unemploy me  some body give a bored lady some thing to do  bahhhh!"
please make holidays stop now!
i need to find a swing that will fit my adult ass  its been far to long
