read the following in number order - it is too long for one post 
"#1  what games that man play, in no other species do you see one group consciously planning to kill another group of its own kind  you see the survival of the fittest animal against animal but after the fight there is reason for the killing and that leaves no thing behind  usually animals kill other animals for food and that at least makes sense "
"#2  men you see kill the other men and look away immediately not even giving that person and whatever sort of family they had a single thought  man ruins lives and tears up the most precious fabric of life that god gave us  hopelessness, despair, heartache, feelings â€“ animals do not have these things and yet they are more civilized than men  war is just a game played by men who have no better thing to do "
"#3   do they even care that in their game of â€œchessâ€� the pieces are conscious living beings with lives and families just as the others do  what hypocrites you find in the human race they fight the war they say for peace but war itself is the absence of peace, the absence of humanity, the absence of feelings in any sort of fashion "
#4   why do men kill one another for a piece of ground or something else that they want? but man is never satisfied  war is all they want and they drag apart the world they have in vain because more is all they want and more is what they never will get
