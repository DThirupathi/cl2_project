"i hope that ever damn jackass who thought that it was a great idea to die and to fly a plane into a building is burning in the deepest pits of hell and are in such pains that words can not describe  the pain, hurt, and hardships that you have put the entire world in are more then enough justification for any eternal damnation that you are e playful eriencing right now  burn in pig fat you f*cks "
"so don't give up so damn easy on the one you love, one you love\somewhere you got a brother, sister, friend, grandmother, niece or nephew\just dying to be with you you know there's someone out there who unconditionally, religiously, loves you\so just hold on 'cause you know it's true\and if you can take the pain\and you can withstand anything, and one day\stand hand in hand with the truth"
