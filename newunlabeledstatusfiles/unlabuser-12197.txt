what should i do tonight?
is feeling solipsistic
not haveing a license sucks  i need a drink and a cig 
"i feel like i should punch someone in the face, or be punched in the face  does it matter that i don't particularly care which one happens?"
"wish i had something to do tomorrow, but i don't have a car  anyone ladies want to be treated to dinner? you just have to come get me "
i hate working saturday when i really just want to go out and have a few drinks 
sometimes i feel incompetent 
i fucking hate printers 
i'm considering converting to pastafarianism 
"somebody come get me, i'm stuck at home "
cabin party= awsome
"drinking a mint julep i just made from scratch, and sitting on my porch  what could be better?"
rock lobster!
wish i had something to do tonight 
to the mountains!
"i wish i knew\just what to do "
anybody want to do something today?
"ah! you would like to know why i hate you today  it will no doubt be \harder for you to understand than for me to e playful lain it to you "
excellent cabin party last night 
went sailing today  good times 
"just because i don't care doesn't mean i don't \understand "
"just saw an article for the most popular things in <propfemale>  it had a picture of roses, puppies, and vicodin "
i'm free!
and so ends a wonderful bacon-christmas!
"hmm, i'm actually starting to get a plan together for the next couple years of my life  interesting "
