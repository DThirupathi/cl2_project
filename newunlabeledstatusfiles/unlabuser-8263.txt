i would just like to do the duty or telling everyone to not   i repeat not join gold's gym   they tell you one thing then do another   good luck if you ever have to cancel a contract with them   and if you do make sure you get everything in writing   just a heads up   so obviously i strongly suggest not to join golds  unless you like being lied to
