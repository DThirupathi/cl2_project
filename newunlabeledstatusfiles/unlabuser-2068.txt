"i hate <propfemale> michaels   i mean seriously what makes her so stinkin' great?  who cares if she has her own tv series, dvd, games, a great body, and as much as i don't want to admit it, she may be pretty   she isn't very nice and that cancels out all of those things  right?  like the red light and that awful noise when i don't do things to her standards are going to motivate me!  seriously, does she know me at all?!!"
"pretty good weekend   my nephew <propmale> was crowned homecoming <propmale> and <propmale> won his 1st football game   i spent time with good friends both friday and saturday, and i got to see my nephew <propmale> for a few hours!"
