"i feel like when children hit obstacles during their education, whether academic or personal in nature, parents, teachers, and schools play the blame-game   are there going to be efforts to educate the educators in a child's life?"
education of a child towards a sucessful future is not only about academic and skill-based exellence but also about teaching a child to think and to push towards their own goals 
teachers and parents are both involved in raising a child   are there going to be efforts to increase collaborate efforts between these two groups?
