yarg    23 hours till my off days 
"today's gonna get better, right?"
and now i dont want it anymore    this is a problem
turn and face the strange changes   
why do people miss the painfully obvious
progress is stunted because of the lack of urgency    so is peace really the answer   
heres to driving like a mongrel!!

willpower  gotta use it  we'll see how long it lasts   
yargasaurus <propmale> im bored

ive overheard it once this has gone on before we seem so far away from everything we are

internal frustration    makes you numb   
needs to get his hands on a copy of aviatic's arrival album  annoyed 
yay for being reckless   
happy 4th
its no meaning besides its not worth it to try; get out
we are scientists concert!
roary-oar!
roar 
yey for eventful days 
horror is about not being in control
you'd think logic says waking up in the morning with all along the watchtower stuck in your head makes that a good day    logic was such a liar 
this summer's ending is starting to feel like a dream   
   something satisfying about a good view
"after all it was you\that's the only e playful lanation\in your broken trains of thought\you had it all so figured out\you were wrong all along\it's just faulty information"
maybe not today or the next day or the next day but you get used to it    right?
these feelings make me remember why i wanted to go numb in the first place   
*humming the bass line for comedown by bush*
   mind running a mile a minute   
"i can't get started from the part where i left off yesterday  \shoulda spent my time a little wiser \i sat alone guilty as sin waiting for words to come \and outta of my head still maing sense to anyone \i can't seem to understand the reason \ i have yet to translate any meaning besides \its not worth it to try  \get out!"
"try to see it once my way \\everything zen \\everything zen \\i don't think so"
im really liking the giants new acquisitions
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you 
duh nuh nuh
   maybe black mesa    haha fat <propmale>   
this top 10 drum songs list is awesome
its like whenever im on time    i would be better off showing late
yay for figuring out movies before there over 
do i seem needy or something?
seems like a dream got me hypnotized
to those of you who know me: am i extremely rational?
that drive was satisfying and the impromtu race didn't hurt  laugh 
"move\\or watch the slow death of your way of life\\there's a science to fear\\it plagues my mind\\and it keeps us right here\\and it keeps us here"
not giving in to it   
"shoutout to the halfway hero, <propmale> manning"
where is my mind?
and today was going so well
you tell me that you heard every sound there is and your bird can swing but you don't get me
you tell me that you've heard ever sound there is and your bird can swing but you don't hear me    you don't hear me
giants defense needs to show up 
damn giants o-line 
time took way too long   
can you make it dissapear?
blah! stupid economics
"i had a dream  crazy dream anything i wanted to know, any place i needed to go"
nothing like the lure of a satisfying drive to make a dead night live
when did everyone start calling me leepert!?
g men what the hell
"its everything\everything you wanted\but what we had got lost along the way\its everything\everything you needed\and i'm reaching out for all the things we lost along the way"
mission accomplished!!!
my week just died   
 laugh 
yey for tornado watches in all the places you 'll be today   
stupid 80 dollar chopin tickets
hate waiting   
there is nothing like deciding things with a coin flip early in the morning!
i feel like high school all over again 
did i just create the backdrop for an epic story in political science
its never a bad idea to take some time off   
is not available due to: gameday!
now lets see if the g-men decide to play for a change
g men d looked like it should tonight
i'm a mess i confess i should just lay in the road
"only in dreams\we see what it means \reach out our hands \\hold onto hers \but when we wake\it's all been erased \and so it seems\only in dreams "
"the world's a rollercoaster and i am not strapped in \maybe i should hold with car but my hands are busy in the air\saying i wish you were here"
thank god for pretty places    make that antsy angry feeling go away
"call the ambulance\i'm fading away\i'm here overwhelmed\i'm here overwhelmed\and life in the shuffle\i'll fall to the back\forever, ever stumbling down this path"
"i don't want your blessing \i don't need caressing \if you find me guilty\then i don't want your sentencing \i don't want your seasons \i don't need a reason \only want your pressure if its to stop the bleeding \we're flesh and blood   "
is wondering what is actually at work here   
lets go gmen
14-0 in the 1st  way to not dissapoint 
giants blowout? yes please
let me tell you one minute won't matter to the rest of your life
i like storms
wants to scream
how do i always end up the bad guy?
"accomplishments are transient\they pull me in unremittingly\just lasting this long, i feel relieved\let repetition save me\well don't call me by my full name\all this is temporary\it feels much better to know\that you won't feel a thing"
is reaching for anything worth holding   
is hating the fact hell be in these situations till he dies 
she gave you a lemon  she's so into you 
well     it feels better now
"i don't look back on anything that will feed me anxiety \\i don't look back on anything soft and glittering \\nights alive and empty starts are your disguise "
i see a blank notebook <propfemale> and its my life and there is nothing i can think to write- i'm not sensing anything

*raises glass* to the 8 hour stint
is disgusted because of the info in the leaked us war documents
browns over saints? wow
i smell blowout  good job gmen
wth giants
find out what you are face to face
why did my economics prof take 10 mins to do simple arithmetic
kinda wish i had <propfemale> and a full tank right now   
is wondering where they are    3 weeks and no contact   
you think no one sees when you don't pretend   
its a crazy idea when i cant even consider it   
"i should be doing what i believe, right?"
is thinking this month is gonna be an eventful considering all the crap he knows is gonna happen    *looks at you* *shoots a look at her* *looks in the mirror*     least it ends with food and a good concert
"i was feeling kind of seasick,\\but the crowd called out for more \\the room was humming harder,\\as the ceiling flew away \\when we called out for another drink,\\the waiter brought a tray "
really likes oldies
thinks his friends wake up too early
gmen out of the gate early
"donâ€™t let yourself down\\donâ€™t let yourself go\\your last <propmale> has arrived"
wondering what grabs people attention when looking at other people  you guys should tell me what makes a random person stick out to you? avoid the obvious doing smething insane please   
being conceited is incredible 
impromptu horror movie night!
"oh so many times since then i've read those words\just waiting to see you, can you see me?"
*insert incredible drum solo here*
that tingling feeling in your stomach when you are on the edge of control has got to be one of the best feelings in the world    
roar! gameday!
eagles skins game is over    ill watch the highlights on espn morrow    which is pretty much every third eagles play
in the long run we're all dead - <propfirst> <propmale> keynes
think today is a throw away day 
 wink 
c'mon you apes  you wanna live forever?
if i hear assassin again    it'll be too soon
g-men need to make sure they dont have the same fate as the skins
"date with <propfemale>, today    she sure is a hard broad to track down "
so this is what its like when it actually works   
city lights are so bright as we go sliding through
   in a coldstone? really?
happy thanksgiving world
interesting way to dream  my subconcious likes messing with me
you just a piece of cheese without the corners    you ain't never gonna be a slice 
strudle!
lose control in increasing pace    warped and bewitched is time erased
"flies in the vasoline we are \sometimes it blows my mind \keep getting stuck here all the time"
thanks for the birthday wishes
round 2! you ready?
   to a 72 hour good mood *raises glass*
you shine brighter    then everyone 
"this is our last chance \this is our last dance \this is ourselves under pressure"
am i the only one who thinks the <propfirst> game is just an excuse for random people to come out of the woodwork?
jury duty is for squares
here's to the realization it was always gonna end up this way *raises glass*
"so what if the grass? is never greener\hoping today should taste much sweeter\i don't wanna talk (i don't wanna talk)\(you wanna know what i'm gonna do?) i wanna taste you (i don't wanna talk)\the way you were wrapped in suspense\said it all, saying nothing at all\the hope at the foot of my bed\said it all, saying nothing at all"
*whistles*
hear that? that's the sound of contentment 
did this hectic day disguise itself as having fun 
its the illusion of progress
feeling weird 
should be a dirtbag 
what a way to feel 
is thouroughly disgusted 
"\what a horrible night to have a curse\"" - <propmale> belmont"""
waiting for true beauty    the kind only nature can have   
merry happy joyous christmas to you and yours
is maintaining his poise 
roar  recovery 
"oh yeah, all right are you going to be in my dreams tonight?"
falling out of existence 
shoutout to awesome insult fest <propfemale> and <propmale>
here's to not living life vicariously  maybe the rest of y'all will go outside to talk to people instead using facebook
