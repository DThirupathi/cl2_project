"-please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons  dragons are nearly unstoppable and in case you didn't know, they can breathe fire  93% of people won't copy and paste this, because they have already been eaten by dragons  6% of people are sitting in the shower   armed with fire extinguishers, and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post this "

watching band of brothers on dvd
"why are people so stupid as to attribute the earthquake in japan to \devine retribution\"" or \""karma\"" for <propfemale> harbor   something that no only happened 70 years ago but also something that the us did more than enough to get revenge for """
"go to your profile  the first 5 friends in the sidebar are your team in the upcoming zombie apocalypse  how screwed are you?\<propfemale> carr, <propmale> becker, <propfemale> <propfemale> child, <propfemale> ruggieri, arty russo\those zombies wont know what hit them"
put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a red sox fan  being a red sox fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously  there is still no known cure for red sox fans and sympathy does not help but we can raise awareness  100% of yankee fans will repost this    simply because we know how to copy and paste      as well as tie our shoes    go yankees!!!!
"very sadly, most of you probably won't copy and paste this  will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour??? it's special education week, and this is in honor of all the children who need a little extra help, <propfemale> & understanding "
