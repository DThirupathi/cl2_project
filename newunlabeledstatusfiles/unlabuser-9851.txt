these niggas out here want to act as if they dnt give a fuck about life  i kno that the next bitch wont treat u right like i did grow up and stop acting immature its not a good look for u cause im done with the bullshit u either get on board or were officially over time for me to live life again and stop getting my heart broken i hate stuck up ass niggas  tryna prove nothng but that they not ready for real bitches
"if you are with someone; today will be a harmonious day with them  if you've been waiting to say something to that special someone, today is the day  love is in the air!"
my day went almost perfect but time for me to start getting on my shit no time for fake niggas not waisting my time on bullshit  need to start over life is to short to not enjoy living
the crazy thing about love is that u are always gong to be hurt so y love somebody when u know wat the end result is going to be? and the answer is heart break
showing someone <propfemale> love them is da best way to get closer  having trust comes afterwards but if the trust isnt there <propfemale> wouldnt have a relationship to keep in tack
