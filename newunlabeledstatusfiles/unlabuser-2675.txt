what can you say when you have no words  
having a lovely time with <propfemale> starks; eating pizza and listening to mgmt  love 
"we don't sleep when the sun goes down\we don't waste our precious time   "
missing someone isn't about how long it's been since you've seen them or the amount of time since you've talked  it's about that very moment when you find yourself doing something & wishing they were right there next to you 
"so if you wanna come in then come in, disappear into me tonight  & if you wanna give in then give in    anything that you feel is right"
<propfemale> christmas   love

remember when you were a madman? thought you was batman!
sometimes i feel like i should speak out about how much i fucking dislike you  but i think i'll keep it to myself  this is what we would call avoiding drama when people are trying to start shit 
"i do my thing, i'm livin in my own world  ?"
i want to see sucker punch so freakin bad 
why is finding a job so difficult nowadays? pfft 
one of those days where i just want to just go to bed and never wake up 
"& i can tell just what you want, you don't want to be alone "
sometimes i can't believe it    i'm moving past the feeling 
"there are so many variables, and humans and our sanity, its all so fragile  its scary to think that if the balance tipped too far you could go insane  honestly i am so amazed that we can live normally or at all "

"i can't slow down, i won't be waiting for you "
i want to once again become numb 
we move just like the <propfemale> and sun 
isn't it pretty to think so?
"respect & follow through with my request when i seriously ask something reasonable of you, and i won't have to bother you about it again, & also you'll get something positive from me and our relationship will better itself in return  is it really that complicated?"
"fuck that shit, get outta your mind "
