had an great new years last night  this morning i woke up to an interesting phone call that now has me furious!

"the house is clean, i had my bath, now i just going to serf on the computer since <propmale> is too busy playing video games  ugh boys and their games! lol "
been on the phone mot of the morning  things are going to be crazy for while  i so wish i was back home right now 
"is happy to have finally got some sleep  almost done unpacking,  is planning to straighten up the garage this week so we can actually walk through there "
hates getting up early for work! i am a night owl!
"is going to take <propfirst> to the groomers, then hopefully take a nap "
"is at work, wishing that she was at home enjoying the rain "
"r i p  <propmale>  mcmahon, <propfemale> fawecett and <propfirst> <propmale>  all were great people and will be missed greatly!"
wow    now <propfirst>  mays 
"i got my hard copy proof that i got my masters degree in the mail yesterday  now i can tell the criminal justice department how i really feel about their program  they for one need to make improvements to their program, such as offering classes that are a"

"was hoping to get the house cleaned today, but did not get to it  i guess i know what i am doing after work tomorrow "
"i am eager to take the test for a job i applied for  i have to get this job, my poor other half cannot keep on supporting me "
is wondering why anyone would want a <propfemale> birthday theme? oh wait   only <propfemale> simpson would 
is tired and not in the mood to put up with anyone's bs 
is teaching herself sign language 
"you know that your extremely tired when no matter how hard you try to focus , your eye sight remains blurry  it's like i need glasses!"
"just watched grindhouse  it was awsome! blood, gore, humor and all so screwed up!"
is waiting for her test result for one job to come back and waiting to here back for an interview on another job

well i did not get the job with tsa  sad   maybe the interview with safeway will come through 
well i did not get the part-time job with safeway either  on a brighter note the lady who interviewed me passed my application on to a recruiter for the reno area  she believes that with my e playful erience i be better working in the stores in a higher position

the first day back to school and i am already off to a great start  had to print off some old campus maps since the new ones do not make any sense  looked up how to reset a class clicker for another student and teach 2 students how to read their class schedule to find their building and room  also several students did not bother to print off their class schedule  amazing!
"i am turning the big \3 0\"" on saturday  a group of us is are going out friday night to party  we are starting at ceol then will probably wonder to other places in that area  anyone else in the reno area who wants to go let me know!"""
thanks everyone for the birthday wishes! it was a great b-day!

"my poor <propfirst> is getting fixed today and getting his back dewclaw removed! this will be a another fun week of keeping him and <propfemale> separated  \sigh\"" hopefully he will calm down a little after this """
"well my poor <propfirst> is home  the vet ended up making 4 incisions, the right nut was easy to get (incision 1), the left nut was tucked away and not where she thought it would be (incision 2), she finds it but at a horrible angel to cut (incision 3), gets in there the best she could to cut it out (incision 4), plus 2 back dewclaws were removed  he is really doped up right now "

i survived the doctor appointment!! *barley* now i just need to get through the midterm this evening then i can take the rest of the night off to chill  maybe i will even go to bed early to catch up on some sleep 
i really wish that she did not get rid of her power drill few years back  my neighbor came over and to drill two of my fence boards that came down in the side yard  after he left i found 6 more boards running along the back that were coming down as well  this is why screws are bettert than nails

looks like i am putting in some extra hours today  yay for extra money!
"trying to bake <propmale>'s b-day cake  hopefully it will come out right  decorating is one thing, baking a cake and having it come out right is another "
"after watching the news about todays flight emergency, i decided that i am going to avoid flying  it's not going to worth the headache to go through all those security procedures that you know are not going to work  stupid people!"
i have to wonder about some of the questions that are asked when applying for jobs 
"why do parents bring their hyper children to the library? for the past hour i have been trying to work on a friends paper and i hear kids jumping up and down the stairs, singing loudly, and the occational screaming  i think i going to have call it quits for the day and finish this tomorrow "
i am actually feeling somewhat human today!  smile 
why do i keep letting myself get involved in evil schemes that i know will get me in trouble with my boss?
is not really feeling it this year for new year <propfemale>  i think i am just going to curl up on the couch and watch movies after work tonight 
happy new years!!!!!
i am feeling a little better now that i have vented  thanks to those who have been listening to my problems that last couple of days! i don't know what i would of done without you guys 
"my new year is not off to a good start at all  on top of my family issues my grandma passed away yesterday  seriously, i do not think i can take much more right now!"
"i am done giving people advice, suggestions and or even helping them with their problems if they are just going to disregard everything!"
"cleaning chairs, listening to music, working extra hours and do it all with my <propmale> <propfemale> for the rest of this week (meaning we are getting into nothing but trouble)  definitely a good day week!"

"to much stress, irrattion, and sadness  i hate moving and seperation  its hard   sad "
"how does one forgive those who have brought so much pain and\anger in oneâ€™s life? forgiveness from those who have cause so much emotional\damage and heart ache? how does one find the will to move on to a better and\brighter life when there is still so many obstacles in ones way?\the darkness is still all around, the demons still got a hold me  i keep\fighting my way towards the light to reach a more peaceful place "
"today was not a good day  too much stress, trying to get last minute things together and packing (that alone is sad and hard)  the situation is really hitting me now "
"wow,i understand someone being upset about their bike being stolen, but to blame homeless people for you missing bike without proof, wanting to beat all of them up with a pipe just for being on campus, and cannot understand why they are even aloud on campus someone has some serious issues  this was coming from a male patron who sat on the computer next to me informing this  i was like yeah, you just stay away from me"

<propfemale> much to do and not enough time before i fly to <propmale> tomorrow with <propmale> to help him find a place to live  this is going to be a very long day

"i have been preoccupied during the past week and will continue to be so for the next few weeks  the demon is still lurking in the shadows for its <propmale> to make its move  i feel it sitting there, watching, waiting  what it does not know is that i am keeping one eye on it at all times  keeping my guard up to prevent it from pulling back into the darkness once again "
i got most of my things into my storage unit and apartment today  still have to go through my closet and the kitchen  need to get a few things for my place (like a microwave)  then its <propmale>'s turn to have his stuff moved 
how can one bear doll that sings immediately stop a person from what they are doing and bring back so much painful memories?
<propmale>'s things have been picked my the movers  monday we leave to take him to <propmale>  for now it's time to get some food then off to work

tomorrow we start heading to <propmale> to take <propmale> to his new home  this is going to be a long trip since i get to drive back to reno alone 
"is not amused with the <propmale>'s movers, now they are not going to be here until sunday supposively  that might mess somethings up causing me to delay things a little bit   sad  plus i accidentally glued my big toe to the wood floor with nail glue  <propmale> got  some entertainment out of that "

"taking care of a few things in <propmale> before heading my way back to reno tomorrow  i will be happy to be home, but not thrilled to be back in reno  as <propfirst> and bean puts it the place  \were dreams go to die \"" which is so true!"""
"made it back home to reno, but still have a lot of things to take care of "
"has to really wonder about the people living in my apartment complex  i guess teeth, grooming, brains, and sanity are optional  yeah           :  "
"once again, my landlord of the place i am still getting my things out of has cost me a day of sleeping in and wasted my time  he is truly a strange guy  at least i have more time to sell the boflex before i have to break it down and try to store it "
is spending the day home sick  great excuse to watch shows i have missed
"enjoyed the night by listening to music while resting on the couch  music can be so therapeutic, which it is why it is so important to me   smile "
