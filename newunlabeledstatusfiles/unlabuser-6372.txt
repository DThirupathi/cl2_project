very fortunate to have my son!!!  missing him like crazy!!! knows there is true hope in christ jesus!!!
missing <propmale> so much!  i want him back home where he belongs!
so excited <propmale> is coming home for the week for vbs!  looking forward to school so <propmale> will be home more permanently!
missing <propmale>   awaiting his return!
"class, life, getting by     want more   you only get out what you put in   something to consider   suppose i should take my own advice "
happy birthday to my sweet 7 year old little man!
so ready for the holidays!!  <propfemale> christmas all!  and happy new year!
"happy new year!  wishing a blessed, successful, and peaceful year in 2011 to all of you on facebook!"
just want to say thank you to all of you who wished me a happy birthday!  so sorry i haven't been able to do this before now   a lack of computer and internet at home is the culprit!  god bless!!
branching out    hoping to find some long lost friends    and news ones!
needs to get out more!
so tired and stressed!  completely drained!  i need sweet oblivion for a few days!
loving my family and my friends and keeping myself open to a harmless flirtation 
had a blast spending father's day with my family!  the only drawback was that my son was with his father instead of with us 
"wants somone, but only the right one "
miserable  yet not   confused   overwhelmed  yet underwhelmed   stressed   completely mixed up 
broken but beautiful
"love me    hate me    either way, you're thinking about me!"
happy independence day!!!
"enjoyed the fireworks last night and spending time with my kid, sister, and her kids   it was cool getting to <propfemale> with <propfemale> for a little while   it's been too long "
"everyone goes through stress   it's when you reach the point of hysteria that you have to stop, breathe, and allow that stress to ease away before it completely consumes you   the best way i have found to do this is just to allow god to take my burderns and let him deal with any problem i have zero control over   it helps me sleep better at night knowing he doesn't sleep and is continuously working in my favor!"
i want to find somone to love who will love me and my son in return 
"today sucks, like most days "
"soon leaving to pick up my son from his dad's, then a weekend with him all to myself!  i'm actually looking forward to having the summer over and school back in session so i can have him on a daily basis again   summer visitation just sucks!"
god is so good!  he has blessed me so completely that i'm consumed with his joy and don't quite know what to think!  all i know is that he has my praise!!!
"feelin' down   missing my 10 year reunion this coming sat   i want to go, but things just didn't come together where i could   big bummer "
when will all the drama end?
"god is so good!  my ex has continually tried to seek custody of our son, but all three times, he has lost   today, we had our forth custody trial and my ex realized he would meet yet again with defeat   so we reached an agreement before the trial and i still retain custody!  praise be to jesus!  thank you, lord!"
"===aacchoo!!!==== ?(-???â€¢?)? if you're allergic to bullshit, drama, games, liars, & fake ass people     keep this sneeze going!"
in so much pain!  i gotta get this hernia fixed!
never is a promise   and i'll never need a lie 
"i find it rather amusing that i can put a status on my profile, then find that facebook will delete said status after a few days without my permission "
"working, working, working!  i enjoy my job   but i stay busy, busy, busy!  lol"
i love my life!  i love being a mom!  i love my classes!  i love my job!  life is good!
fall break for my son starts tomorrow and he's spending it with his dad   so not looking forward to <propmale> being gone   hit me up if ya wanna <propfemale>   i will need the distraction 
"i really have awesome friends   they've really come through for me, keeping me company and hanging with me while <propmale> is at his dad's   especially <propfirst>, who has shared his son's with me when i'm not at work or school   aiden and <propmale> are so wonderful!  i've fallen for them   can't wait to see them again today after work!"

"eight years ago today, my life changed completely   i became a mom, the most rewarding and best accomplishment i shall ever have   happy birthday, <propmale>!"
i wonder if he's interested   the way he looks at me makes me think he might be   i wish he'd let me know if he's considering me as a potential 
blessed with so many people who love me and that i can call framily (friends that are family )
"about to give a tour to 60 8th graders here at roane state   i've never done it before and just got asked moments ago   so i figure, how hard can it be???"

\who do you think you are?  runnin' 'round leaving scars," collecting your jar of hearts   you're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul   don't come back for me   don't come back at all   who do you think you are?\""  \"8180f5ef5ef41a8f948fa5f0cc75f90b,"in school, you learn your lesson, then get tested   in life, you get tested, then learn your lesson!"

"if your mom is or was your hero, your best friend, or just the best mom ever, if you are blessed to still have your mom or if she is an angel in heaven, paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your mom, and that you love her dearly  you    can replace a lot of people in life, but you only have one    mom!!"

"i'm teaching myself how to knit in order to complement my crochet   i've got the knit stitch down and am having so much fun   my friend <propfemale>, who gave me help on how to incorporate my crochet style into knitting, told me that my work looked really good   her one criticism: chillax the stitch!  it's still a bit too tight and can be loosened for easier flow   i'm lovin' this!"
