"they say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never question your friendship  this type of friend picks up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it's been, how far away they live & they donâ€™t hold grudges  they understand that life's busy but that you'll always love them  repost    this if you're lucky to have at least one of these friends "
