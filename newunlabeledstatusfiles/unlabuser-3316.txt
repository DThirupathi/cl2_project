          good question
"â€œto love is to risk not being loved in return  to hope is to risk pain  to try is to risk failure, but risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing â€�"
"â€œfor everything you have missed, you have gained something else, and for everything you gain, you lose something else â€�"
if it has 2 wheels or a skirt i can't afford it       
the personal life deeply lived always e playful ands into truths beyond itself ~
"â€œwhen i see you smile and know that it is not for me, that is when i will miss you the most â€�"
"motocross is not a thing that we do to be popular make money, or get the girls but it is something that we do for the love of being on a dirt bike  the countless hours all of us put in to this sport is not because we want to be famous, but because we love it you will never have a bigger adrenaline rush than lining up at the gate with 40 riders next to you, all wanting the same thing,to win "
i wish i was that guy from the miller light commercials so i could walk into parties and take peoples beer without getting yelled at
so i was just driving high and i stopped to let a pinecone cross the road because i thought it was a hedgehog 
"considering last night's endeavors, i am going to hell 5 times over  1 for puking on a hobo, 1 for laughing about it, and 3 for remembering it today and laughing about it sober"

"â€œi've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel â€�"

hope looks for the good in people instead of the worst: hope opens doors when despair closes them: hope lights a candle instead of cursing in darkness: hope regards problems small and large as opportunities: hope is a good loser because it has the divine insurance of final victory    never lose hope! ~
