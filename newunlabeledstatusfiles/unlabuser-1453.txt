mavs needed this game    down 3-1 in the series aver que pasa but it is tough 
congrats to <propmale> for sweeping the bobcats    the hawks can't win a playoff game on the road if their life depended on it    looks like the suns will win against the blazers 
"congrats to the cavs and celtics for making it to the second round, will be a good series between them    mavs will live to fight another day    lakers were able to run the thunder out of l a tonight, now lets see if they can play like that in oklahoma!"
the raiders are set to release jamarcus <propfirst>    can this really be true?
lots of props to the bucks for going into atlanta and beating the hawks    props to the nuggets too for getting their balls out and beating the jazz 
"mavs and blazers have joined the heat, the bobcats and bulls in the annual fishing trip with <propmale> smith, better luck next year   "
"lakers move on as they kick the thunder out of the playoffs, starting to think pau gasol is the best player on the lakers    utah moves on as well so congrats to both "
"alright going to bed but i want to thank <propmale>, <propfemale>, and <propmale> for taking me to dinner    sort of a pre-birthday celebration lol and isy o'lomeli since you tagged me earlier i am now doing the same to you lol <propmale> rato cabrona  laugh "
last night the cavs had just enough to beat the celtics to start of the second round match-ups    the hawks ended the first round today by over-powering the bucks    the lakers got a scare but were just able to beat the jazz 
"i want to thank those who took time out of their day to give me their birthday wishes, this means a lot to me  laugh     quiero agrader aquellos que tomaron tiempo de su <propfemale> para darme sus deseos de cumpleanios, esto significa mucho para mi  laugh "
the magic took the hawks to the woodshed and gave them a beating    nice try jazz but once again you come up short(literally) to the lakers  goodnight to all 
the magic once again took the hawks to the woodshed and gave them a beatdown again    if you would have told me the jazz would score 110 points i would say they probably won but they let the lakers score 111 points so they lost!
happy mother' day to all the mothers out there    feliz <propfemale> de las madres a todas las mamas 
the celtics showed their guts and tied the series with the cavs    spurs got sweeped! who would have thunk it? i thought they would win game 4 for pride but the suns did what they had to do 
the calves are out    i meant the cavs are out  looks like they ran out of fuel and the fact mo <propmale> cant guard rajon rondo if his life depended on it!
"now that the suns won the western conference finals is not a competitive series, good night a todos "
"gotta give props to the magic, they showed guts and the will to win today  they won't win this series but at least they can build on this for next season    lets see if the suns can keep up the energy they had sunday cuz if they can't it is over for them too "
"gotta give props to the suns, they are making that zone defense work even though many say that is the easiest defense to attack but when you lack a true point guard, it is a bit difficult to break down as the lakers have shown in games 3 & 4, goodnight people "
more props to <propmale> for winning again    are boston sports fans starting to have bruin nightmares lol
hmmm japan played england today and japan scored all 3 goals of the game    unfortunately 2 were own goals so the lost 1-2!
hmmm england played japan today as a warm-up of the world cup and japan scored all 3 goals of the game    unfortunately 2 of them were own goals so they lost 1-2!
