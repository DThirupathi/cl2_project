"what i want most for my sons is that they are free to be true to themselves, to e playful ress their own view without hesitation, and to never give up their dreams"

eventually you realize that some things are just not meant to be no matter how much you want it 
"is going to have a nervous breakdown - i've earned it, i deserve it and n surprise ne is going to stop me!!!"

"trying to have a phone conversation with someone who has young kids, is like talking to someone with tourettes!"
"it's 8 surprise 0 at night   the sun is down   all the windows are open, and it's still 94 degrees in my house!"
you know you might be a redneck when    your 7 year old tries to convince you he needs an air soft gun for protection from all the bad guys that live in your trailer park 
got my air to work!  yay! its 105 degrees outside!
woke up this morning with a huge smile on my face   damn kids and those sharpie markers!!

"women are equipped with a super power and it is called intuition  never doubt it and always trust it  men, be afraid, be very afraid!"
the air smelled sooo good this morning!  i love it when it rains!  i even heard thunder!
"in the long run, the truth always hurts less than a lie "
"men will play a certain role in our lives, but it's other women who are always there for us   women have to be there for each other  we have to have each others backs   we all need to get over our pety jealousies and learn to see each other as sisters who are in this fight together   its the only way we'll survive "
"is single, and has decided due to the weather change that it's time to have a boyfriend to keep me warm   oh no wait i found my electric blanket - never mind!"
im so sick  : (
i feel so sick that i put on clean underwear just in case i have to be transported by abulance in the middle of the night      or i croak   either way i thought it was a good idea  
"love is always bestowed as a gift; freely, willingly, and without e playful ectation  we donâ€™t love to be loved, we love to love "
