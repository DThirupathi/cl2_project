"\it's probably not safe to go in the water if the penguins aren't in it \"" seriously? where does my brain come up with this stuff? i was asleep! and why in the world did my sleeping brain decide a pond should go in the middle of a classroom and there should be penguins there??"""

the list of reasons why <propfirst> ruiz is my favorite baseball player just got a little bit longer 
"<propmale> thorpe was beautiful, absolutely adorable little town; the old jail was sooo creepy, especially the basement where they had the solitary confinement cells (and cell 17 where the handprint of one of the <propfemale> maguires is was pretty weird, too); and i was just really close to a doe and two fawns (like, 2-3 yards, maybe) "
"hickory run state park is absolutely beautiful, and the boulder field was amazing!!! i don't think i've ever seen so many rocks in one place!"
"just watched 16 innings of hell  they had a pitcher playing left field, used up their entire bullpen, had the left fielder on first 'cause the first baseman was [unjustly] tossed, and the game was 5 hours long  and then they lost  poor phils    at least they went down fighting "
is just a little bit sad that it stopped raining 
i think i just witnessed genuine madness 
i think i just died three million times tonight  deathly hallows part 1 = absolute amazingness   love 
totally just watched a forty-year-old man play with <propfemale> pockets 
<propmale> rickman trying to do an <propfemale> accent is a wretched failure
