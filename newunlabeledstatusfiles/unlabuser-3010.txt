"is off to six flags  great <propfemale> with her cousins and <propfemale>, will be back some odd random time on monday so leave one if ya want   smile  ttyl"
"i should have just fuckin ended everything when i had the <propmale>, i should have known they would turn on me sooner or later no matter what they said, i should have seen through their lies  their <propfemale> tales  i should have known it was all just going to di"

"memory is a way of holding onto the things you love, the things you are, and the things you never want to lose "

when life gives you lemons make grape juice and let the world wonder how you did it 
i like whatever drug the hospital gave me since morphine didnt even touch the fricken pain!! though now i have to rely on the dand crutches  but its a really good thing we had them sitting around the house cause i would not be able to walk right now  nothing is broken  or at least thats what they said  and the xrays said that as well but i tend to wonder because of the severe pain anything from even light touches
damn <propmale> sidewalks!! whoever owns that sidewalk needs to fix it and we have pics  though on a kinda funny side  my foot matches my toenail polish  eh  blue   but no touchy touchy!!
so if i had to choose a way to die  i would choose to die by a coca cola e playful losion cause that you be uber epic awsomeness!!
friends are like potatoes  if you eat them they die!
o o!!!! yay!!! house is back on tomorrow at 7!!!!!!
sometimes you have to walk through the darkness in order to find the light   
"c'mon this can't be the self-destruct button!! if it was, they wouldn't leave it lying around like this where anyone could push it!! hm, oh well    *push*   tick  tick  booooom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"white roses, are they pure, or are they just dead of their beauty?"
"every time you betray me, it feels like you've pierced my heart   every time you lie to me, it feels like you've shot me in the head   how much longer will this continue, how much more can i take   when you've fallen i would feel despair  would you? would you even care if i left this lonely world?"
"rest in peace uncle <propmale>, you are loved and missed dearly, may your soul find peace whereever you are "
"f is for friends who do stuff together  u is for you and me  n is for anywhere any time at all down here in the deep blue sea  f is for fire that burns down the whole town  u is for uranium bombs  n is for no survivors when ya wanna take over the world  f is for frolic through all the flowers  u is for ukulele  n is for nose picking, sharing gum and sand-licking here with my best <propmale>!!!"
what draco says is quoted in single quotation marks and what <propmale> says is in regular quotation marks; '<propmale>  are you spacing again? is that healthy for the baby?'    â€œdraco   i can only hope we donâ€™t have a baby girl â€�     'why?! whatâ€™s that supposed to mean?!'     â€œi can already tell that youâ€™re the overprotective type! and with a girl   youâ€™d be any boyfriendâ€™s worst nightmare â€�    'ass '

facing your fears is difficult yes     but falling in love with them     is a nightmare even the devil himself would call hell    
never let your memories be greater then your dreams   
i have this strange unresistable but unatainable urge to play the game hungry hungry hippos

sometimes you have to walk through the darkness to find the light
"black = i hate you  pink = i like you  purple = i \would date you  blue = i did love you  red = i love you  orange = i \like talking to you  white = i really care about you  silver = we're\close  green = you're hot  yellow = i couldnt live without you  \brown = best    friends  set this as your status and see what you get (eh who knows why not)"

"the heart dies a slow death  shedding each hope like leaves, until one day there are none  no hopes  nothing remains"
"my deepest condolences to the friends and family of those who passed today in the mt <propfirst> corn bin tragedy, my prayers and thoughts are with you all"
"i wish i knew of a way to help, a way to make him feel better   to feel as if he is not alone   i wish he could see just how much he means to me and how much i adore and love him   i would give him the world to see his beautiful smile and laughter   "
watch me tear myself apart while i wait and see   wait for the world to crash down on me and to shatter again   watch the blood splatter on the walls as it crushes everything around it   the distruction brought with this shit can only kill you   it doesnt make you stronger no it just kills you   
"watch as the world caves in and crushes everyone and everything around it   watch as the blood covers everything around it, dripping down the body, turning the ground beneath crimson    everything fades into the background  just like you knew it always would   everything disapears  until there's nothing left  the only thing to do is to let it crush you   "
\far across the distance and spaces between us you have come to show you go on  \,3d6b795dc61492d57e7fbf065dad3f67,"watch the knife slice through the soft skin   the crimson substance slowly seeps out  drip, drip  drip   feel your self fading as it stains the ceramic tile beneath   you want to feel the pain again, because in your mind theres nothing left, nothing worth fighting for   so now tell me is there really something out there that's worth the fight?"
\far across the distance and spaces between us you have come to show you go on  \,3d6b795dc61492d57e7fbf065dad3f67,"i found you here, now please just stay for a while i can move on with you around i hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever? i'll do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done we both know the day will come, but i don't want to leave you"
if i text you  it means i miss you  if i dont it means im waiting to see if you miss me
just leave me alone i guess   everyone else does
"watch you walk away like everyone else   watch you leave without a glance back  its okay   ill mend the open wounds you left by slowly replacing them with new parts that i rip apart, just so i can feel the mind numbing pain of being left all alone  again i probably should have seen it coming  should have known that you would just walk away   should have known that you werent real   and that it was all a trick"
"i wanted you to fight for me, to tell me that theres no one else you would rather be with and that you would rather be alone then without me  but that was to much to ask i guess   it was just another wish that didnt come true"
the only thing to fear is fear itself   and spiders! fuck spiders!!
"if you like me then just tell me, if you miss me then show it, if you love me then prove it to me!!"
"there comes a point in your life when you finally realize who matters, who never did, who wont anymore, and who always will  so dont worry about your past, there's a reason they werent able to make it to your future "
so the good news is ive stopped fighting my inner demons and we're now on the same side   the bad news (at least for you that is) is we're plotting your very slow and very very painful demise 0 smile  hope you enjoy it  laugh  cause it'll be extremely enjoiyable for us hehe

"you dont love someone because of beauty, you love someone because they sing a song only you can understand "
the hardest thing in life to know is which bridges to cross and which to burn
life is not measured by the number of breaths you take but by the moments that take your breath away 
okay so full grown pitbulls do not make good lapdogs no matter how badly they would like to believe otherwise <life and death>
"'imagine i am in jail, what crime do u think i have done' o o?"

and here i had almost forgotten you but yet you still manage to sneak your way back into my mind  v v
"there's some things i regret, some words i wish had gone unsaid, some starts that had some bitter endings --there's some mistakes that i have made, some chances i just threw away, some roads i never should've taken, some pages turned, some bridges burned, but there were lessons learned "

"a person has 1000 wishes  a soldier only has one, to come home safe  i \know 97% of you wont post this as your status,but the 3% that do are my \friends  in honor of someone that died or is fighting for your freedom \please post!!! may god bless our troops & bring each one of them   home safely ?"
