"lucky me! had a wonderful day with <propfirst> ( love )  like normal, he has to leave and i hate it  but i will see him soon again  laugh   also, dreading school  still don't have my drivers like i was begging for all summer  found some things to customize my car, but need money to do so   sad "
"don't want to go to school  i want to sleep 'til late and refresh my mind  one year left yay! also, one year again without my drivers (still majorly pissed)  riding the bus during your senior year sucks  life must go on, so be it  dreams just seem to be fading in the vast distance anyway  i still have my <propfirst>  smile  see you guys tomorrow  buh-bye "
"first day of being a senior      how do i put this? seems like my classes are going to be easy  only concerned about trig and econ  but the teachers will most likely make it easy  don't get to see <propfirst> much in the hall  crying  honestly, i have most classes without my friends in them  but so far, so good  hopefully next semester will be better  it normally is  i love my <propfirst>  love "
