"so    <propmale> knows about <propfirst> & i  he prety much wants to kill <propfirst>  so   that's not good, but we are one step closer to things being ok   instead of staying in hiding and accomplishing nothing  i love him    and he loves me    so    <propmale> cut my phone off    but    we will try to get through this together   laugh "

for those of you whom have been trying to reach me  my phone was in <propfirst>'s name   he cut it off cause he found out i was with <propfirst>  then my boss got me a new one   so awsome    but <propfemale> put it in the toilet  haha buger head! so now <propfirst> is letting me use his old phone sense he got a new cooler one  the number is 918 716 8536  i get mine fixededed on the 1st  so i'll let you know when it's working!
