i'm so happy the <propfirst> pound is putting pictures of the animals online! i hope everyone saves an animal instead of going to a pet shop  http annoyed  www cityofterrell org animal-shelter htm#pet
got up at 4 for my first black friday and i'm officially done shopping for the month! yay! now it's time for my nap!
got a new pound <propfemale>! i think it's boscoe's love child!
thanks everyone!
thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes! i had a great day & don't want to work tomorrow!
so what do you do after you wake up at 4 am and your water heater has burst?
i miss having a boy cat! this skank won't shut up!
<propfirst> & dad are installing the new water heater! i'm happy & scared of the blow torch!
servpro ripped out all the carpet & crammed 25 fans and dehumidifiers in the house  it's sooo loud & messy we have to stay in a hotel for a few days!
i love snow!
i'm watching <propfemale> with the nerds in my family!
i just saw a commercial for gnomeo & <propfemale>! how do i not know about this movie?
dad just beat us on wii bowling & danced around the living room! he cracks me up 
it sucks that <propfirst> spun off the road but i'm glad he got to come home and play in the snow with me!
they've been trying to get <propfirst> out for thirty minutes with no luck  his car just keeps sliding down the hill  if this doesn't work the cops have to close a <propfirst> on 80 to help the tow truck get a better position 
ok he's out now but he's facing the wrong way  i'm praying he gets turned around without getting hit or stuck again!
<propfirst> just got antiqued in honor of tosh 0
the dogs got sprayed by a skunk this morning and now my house stinks!
our house has carpet again! yay!
we got our first fancy vacuum today!
