i've just gotta get my hubby to mow the lawn while i finish making food and straightening the last little bit and then we're all ready for <propfirst>'s party  5 smile 0 tomorrow at our place! let me know if you're coming so i can make sure i've got enough food!
last batch of blondies are in the oven and boy do they smell amazing! heading to bed as soon as they're done  gotta be up with the birthday boy and then spend the day putting finishing touches on his party stuff! i can't believe my last baby's turning 1!
"it's hard to believe that <propfirst> is 1 year old today  just a year ago i was getting very upset with my doctor because they kept telling me that he wasn't ready to be born yet  however, we were fairly sure that my duedate was wrong and infact i was overdue "
the party went well and the birthday boy is passed out in bed 
oh no   dorian's eyeing the leftover cake 
getting ready to have some friends over  probably going to set up the pool for the kids so that should be fun 
taking it easy today  might be doing something this evening but i'm so exhausted i really need to veg out for a while 
not even 5pm and i'm ready for bed  hopefully i can get the kids to bed and then turn in early tonight!
getting the kids stuff packed for a week at grandma's 
xander and triniti are at mom's for the week  <propfirst>'s in bed  hubby leaves for <propmale> in the morning  what on earth am i going to do all week???
"i need copies of the other photos that were taken at <propfirst>'s party so i can have a full album! send them my way, please!"
<propfirst> is shaking drops of milk out of his sippy cup onto his cereal before he eats it  lol 
<propfirst>'s getting home for the weekend tonight and we're picking the kids up from moms  it'll be nice to have a full house again!
"ok, we need to get our car fixed and it's going to cost $350 that we do not have right now  it's completely out of commission until we can get it fixed  please, pray that we can come up with the money "
getting ready for this evening  my little brother's coming over!
"had a good visit with <propfirst> and <propfemale>  now, off to get some much needed sleep "
car's fixed!
getting ready to <propfemale> out with friends
getting ready to go to j's dad's for the picnic and fireworks 
j's sick  sad 
almost over this illness   i think 
cleaning house and doing laundry 
"if you have ahusband that makes you laugh, that you can say is your best friend, whoyou want to grow old with, who you know will always be there to pickyou up when you are feeling down, who is your world, and a man you canthank god for every night, copy and paste this to your profile with   your anniversary date    july 31, 2004"
trying to figure out what to do for our 6th wedding anniversary tomorrow 
"well, today marks the 6 year anniversary of the day i married <propfirst>  i can honestly say i'm looking forward to many many more  smile "
spending a few days up at my dad's house 
back home now  it's good to see <propfirst>  smile  i really hate that he has to travel for work 
"i have carried a\child within my body  i have comforted my child upon my chest  my body\is not magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see a mother,\and there is no greater honor or blessing  make this your status if you\are proud to be a mother!!"
xander starts school in the morning  i don't know if i'm more nervous or excited  he's very nervous but is convinced that his ironman backpack is the coolest in existence 
sorry about not posting an update sooner  our internet went out temporatily but it looks like we've got it back up and running again  xander's first day went well  he's very excited about school and has already made some new friends that he wants to invite over to play 
xander was up before the alarm and clamoring to get ready for school so he wouldn't be late  i'm glad to see him so excited 
"well, xander got his first yellow card sent home today for pushing another child while standing in line  hopefully this doesn't become a trend "
it's 11am and i'm already ready for a nap 
2 days without a yellow card  looks like he's decided to behave lol 
had a blast at the renaissance festival yesterday  hopefully we'll get to go again in a few weeks 
getting ready to head up to the in-laws for a grill out 
getting triniti ready to go spend some time at her papaw's house 
missing my babygirl but i'm sure she's having a blast at papaw and <propfemale>'s house 
i seriously wish my throat would stop hurting and i would stop sneezing 
on 9-11-01 i was sitting in mr  merk's business law class when a <propfemale> came over the intercom to turn all tv's to a certain news station  i don't think i've ever heard an entire high school go completely silent before or since that day 
uh-oh  blue card today  sad  he'd better straighten up at school or he's gonna end up not getting his prize in 2 weeks 
he was good at school today  yay 
"well, xander got sent to the principal's office today for poking people with his pencil andcrawling under his desk  looks like he's lost his prize "
he was blue again today  what's up with him ths week!
xander's very excited  he's about to lose his first tooth 
xander was blue again today but it was only for talking too much instead of pushing other kids so this is at least an implrovement 
xander was good at school today!
xander's off to school  time to make necklaces with triniti while <propfirst> plays 
xander ended the week with a green card  smile 
"cleaning house, doing laundry, and getting ready for the weekend "
today is xander's kindergarten picture day  hopefully he smiles nice and sits up straight  <propfirst> has decided that walking is the way to go unless he's trying to  run away from mommy  then he drops down on all fours and speeds away  triniti thinks she rules the roost and is insisting on being called <propfemale> triniti 
"xander got 3 reen cards this week  that's an improvement  smile  his progress report was really good, too "
it would be nice if the sun would show up at some point  this weather's making me sleepy 
"xander and triniti are at the <propmale> evans farm festival with my mom  <propfirst>'s napping and <propfirst> is in the basement  wow, it's quiet "
"it's couples week  copy and paste when you got together   september 24, 2003   married july 31, 2004 "
it's hard to believe my baby boy is 6 years old today 
"it's mommy week! post this with the date you first became a mommy   ? ? october 18, 2004 ? ?"
"please put this on your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons  dragons are nearly unstoppable\and, in case you didn't know, they can breathe fire  93% of people\won't copy and paste this, because they have already been eaten by\dragons "
"to all of my friends who play wow annoyed \what's up with all of the fail tanks! that is all "
"your\son will hold your hand for only a little while but will hold your\heart for a lifetime  it's 'sons week' if you have a son that makes\your life worth living by just being around them, if you are proud of\your son, copy and paste this to your status "
happy thanksgiving everyone!
getting ready for the aho christmas party 
getting ready to head out to lunch and to the store 
snow day yesterday  2 hour delay today  i must say it's been nice having the whole family together for a couple of extra days 
i really need this weather to stop  j can't work when it's this cold so he's out of work until it warms up a <propmale>  we really need the money so   c'mon stop with this coldness already 
busy day yesterday  had christmas at mom's and then went out with j to see tron 
xander has had 2 green cards in a row  lets hope he's finally out of his rotten streak!
"due to <propfirst> starting a new job, we will not be able to do any traveling for christmas  <propfemale> christmas everyone  sorry we can't make it "
<propfemale> christmas everyone 
xander started yesterday with a green card and he got the homework award  lets hope today goes just as well 
xander got 2 green cards this week and the rest were yellow  good news is  yellow is the worst he got and the yellows were only for things like getting out of his seat once 
2 green cards so far this week for xander  he's on a roll  laugh 
"after watching several people almost wreck on my road, i am no longer questioning the snow day "
"my question is this   if school's closed, why on earth take down the posting when people are trying to get their kids ready for school? naturally we're going to assume (since it's no longer posted) that there is school!"
"a little boy in xander's class une playful ectedly lost his father on friday   please, keep this family in your thoughts and prayers as they go through this difficult time "
so the interview went well but the job isn't as flexible as i was lead to believe during the phone interview so we're figuring out if i am going to be able to take the job offer or not 
"dear snow, i'm sick of you  it would be in the best interest of everyone if you would just go away "
"well, i think we're all finally completely better so i'm scrubbing down the house today to get rid of all the germs "
i can't believe my baby girl will be 5 in 6 days 
triniti's 5th birthday is on monday but we're going to have her party on the 12th  probably at <propfemale> corral in the party room   lemme know if you're wanting to attend 
it's amazing how a bit of snow and clouds can make a person feel so overly exhausted 
happy valentines day 
lasagna's in the oven  breadsticks are ready to be poped in as soon as the lasagna's done  pecan pie and peanut butter and fudge bars are in the fridge  this should be a good valentines day dinner 
so far xander's doing really well with his behavior at school this week  lets hope he keeps it up 
so far xander's had all green cards this week  lets hope today is another good day!
i will be so glad when i get back in shape cause right now these workouts are killing me 
"??????????????? ????? ????????????????\it's daughters week! if you have a beautiful daughter that you\love more than you can describe, copy and paste this to your\status for a little while, but hold them in your heart for a lifetime!\??????????????? ????? ????????????????"
"the kids are mostly better from their colds, xander's doing really well in school this week, and <propfirst> was able to send in his resume for a very good job  so far, this week has been pretty good  now, lets just hope <propfirst> gets the job lol "
"aocdrndicg to rscheearch at cmabrigde uinervtisy, it dseno't mtaetr waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae  tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe  if you can raed tihs, psot it to yuor wlal       olny 55% of plepoe can"
<propfirst> has an interview today  lets hope it goes well 
it's absolutely lovely outside today 
he got the job and starts this week!
"husband and wife week-if your spouse is your best friend, works hard for you, who has been with you through thick and thin, who loves you when you're at your worst, and whom your are proud to be married to, copy and paste this with the year you were married; july 31, 2004 "
had a bad day yesterday and today's not looking any better  oh joy 
banana
i'm thinking of getting my hair cut  the uber long hair is driving me absolutely insane 
"xander's off to school so it's time to get the rest of the family ready to go grocery shopping and such  hopefully it stops being so overcast today, it's making me sleepy "
how in the world am i sleepy and energetic at the same time? this makes no sense 
"dear snow,\   it is a few hours until april   go away!\sincerely,\ohio"
"you and i wake up in a psychiatric <propmale> together  using four words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well  be a good sport and play along  four words is harder than you think"
it's scary to think that <propfirst> will be 2 in 2 months  when i realize things like this i have to remind myself that 3 kids is far more than enough     but i will miss the baby days 
it's a nice day so far  hopefully it'll get warm enough to take <propfirst> and triniti to the park while xander's at school 
another nice warm day  i wonder if spring has decided to stop teasing us and actually stay this time 
"ok, i love the warm weather  however, i am not in love with the fact that it's making my skin act like it's meant for a teenager "
i've either got a bad cold or allergies acting up and the kids are running wild today  haha go figure 
i just had xander pick out which of his baby pictures he wanted to send in for his kindergarten graduation slide show  it's amazing how quickly 6 years have gone    he was barely the size of a football when he was born and now he's nearly to my shoulders  i often stop and stare at him because he says some of the most astounding things  it's hard to believe that this super intelligent 6 year old is my son 
what a nice day today  i think i'm gonna take the kids out to play after i finish up the housework 
"a 15 year old girl holds her1-year old son; people call her a slut, but nobody knew she was raped at the age13  make fun of someone because they are fat, but you don't know they have a serious health condition that causes her to be fat  call the old guy ugly, but you don't know he got a serious face injury after serving his country    or saving someone's life  re- post this if you're against bullying"
"making dinner then finishing up laundry  probably playing d&d tonight, should be fun "
time to head to bed  yardwork and laundry tomorrow  hopefully i'll have time to squeeze in something fun 
"nearly done with the laundry and then hopefully i'll have some time to relax tonight  xander's spring break starts tomorrow, i'd better conserve my energy lol "
if i turn on the ac it gets too cold  if i turn on the heat it gets too warm and if i just turn everything off it gets really humid  grrrr 
i just made some of the best spaghetti with garlic biscuits  yum!
i know it's a nice day and all but could all of the motorcycles choose another road to go down?! hours and hours of pretty much nonstop motorcycle noise is getting really annoying 
"apparently, taking my one-a-day and then being around cleaning chemicals makes me queasy when neither of them do separately lol  how strange "
triniti's kindergarten registration screening is on monday  i dunno what i'm gonna do with my two oldest in school 
rain rain go away  i want my pretty weather back 
"to all my fb friends, in honor of mother's day i'm trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother and keep it there till may 9  i did and so have several others  if you will and like this idea, please re-post this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many beautiful mothers we can get on fb  happy motherâ€™s day to all beautiful moms there!"
i just got my first hand made mothers day card and gift from xander  i'll have to get out my camera and post some pics of it
