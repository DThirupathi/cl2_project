its one thing to mess with my mind but when you involve my two boys  that just aint right 
life sure throws some une playful ected curve balls sometimes
"i'll be your huckleberry  \ok now name the movie "
"please send your thoughts and prayers to the family of the 7 year old little boy that went missing from his school friday morning  hopefully , the authorities will bring him home safe and sound  i am only imagine the pain that the little boys parents are going through "
5 more school days then the boys are on summer break
people need to learn that if it doesnt involve them to keep their noses out of other peoples business 
woohoo!!!! off to go get mynew phone i can't wait 
thank god for my dad  i wasn't able to get as many fireworks for the boys as i wanted to  but grandpa came to the rescue  yeah for grandpa

wtf some people just don't understand a single parents point of view 
1 mom with 2 growing boys  what to do? oh what to do?
love this heat! hope its here to stay for a while 
tired of waiting for the phone to ring
as a parent i hope that they find whoever has or did something to kyron and fry the person  its tragic what's going on with the little boy 
the most enjoyable e playful eriences are often free  especially if you have kids 
yummy! red lobster for dinner someone loves me 
i am finally 100% free from the past
woohoo shopping trip with grandma today  just her and i just like old times 
"sometimes i think i miss my old life  then i remember all the pain, hurt and sadness  and i <propfemale> screw that i am right where i need to be "
bored out of damn mind
nothin like watching lonesome dove to cure a bad case of boredom 
headed to my cousins wedding  omg i am actually wearing a dress  today is gonna be a long long day 
when the people who matter most to you treat you like a second class person sometimes its really hard to look the otherway  especially when its family 
seeing pictures of people i care about from the past brings up lots of emotions that are hard to deal with  
life sucks someimes  it really sucks when you know what you want but can't have what you want 
i am so confused he says he wants me and wants to be with me  but he's not sure when he wants it  how hurt can i get in one night 
love all this sun  it means shorts and bathing suits  just if the tan would set in  than things would be all good 
why does he do this?
why does he say one thing than do the exact opposite  what does he really want?
after hope is gone than what happens?
gonna take the boys to the zoo today  pictures to come later 
"he's done it once again  what to do? oh, what should i do?"
so much for planning something for my birthday  it seems like everyone has something more important to do  so maybe life will just fast forward till after my bd
i think i am just gonna spend my birthday with my kids and call it good  them telling me happy birthday is one of the best gifts i could ever get anyways 
just got about 150 new pics posted  theres new pics of the boys in there  so if you haven't seen them for a while check them out  they are getting so big 
i don't know where i stand with you  and i don't know what i mean to you  all i know is that when i think of you all i want is to be with you 
woohoo the weekend is almost here
got to chat to an old friend for a few minutes today  it sure felt good to talk to someone from a more enjoyable time 
and the countdown is on  6 days and counting 
"how many of us really know everybody on our facebook friends list? here's a\task for you  i want all my fb friends to comment on this status about \how you met me  after you comment, copy this to your status so i can do \the same to you  you'll be amazed at the results you get "
the countdowns on   4 days to go 
some people are such cry babies

it's a new day - a <propmale> to make new friends or piss off a whole new group of people  it could go either way 
i am a mama bear   try to hurt my cubs and i will hunt you down and make you pay!
"don't underestimate short people, they are stronger than they look "
looking back some choices are totally wrong  but now there's nothing that can be done  just gotta ride it out until things can be fixed in a way thats best for everyone 
waiting till things calm down to figure things out 
mistakes have been made  now all that's left is to try and fix things some how  that way this can be fixed so my two little men are not hurt by this in any way 
excuse me     while i pretend to give a shit!!!
wow blast from the past  gremlins is on  i haven't seen this is years  good times good times 
it's sad when a persons indirect actions hurt more than their words do 
wow finally done trick or treating with the boys  they made a good haul  between the two of them they got almost 10 pounds worth of <propfemale> 
"thank you to all of the veterans, past and present  without their great love for this country none of our freedoms would not be possible  thank you so much to all those who have died or given pieces of themselves for the freedoms that we have everyday "
homeless go without eating  elderly go without needed medicines  mentally ill go without treatment  troops go without the proper equipment  veterans go without benefits that were promised to them!!! yet we donate millions of dollars to other countries before helping our own first! 1% will re-post and the 99% of people on facebook won't have the guts to re-post

"nothing like getting into the christmas spirit like watching \grandma got run over by a reindeer\"" and \""the grinch who stole christmas\"" """
my thoughts go out to the people in aumsville   people think think that tornados can't happen here but i guess today proves them wrong 
"if you have not lived my life, suffered my pain, enjoyed my happiness, walked my path, seen what i have seen, then you can't judge me or my pain "
"don't mistake my kindness for weakness, my ability to look over things as ignorance - but make no mistake, when i've had enough, i'm done!"
if its true that you are no better than the company to that you keep  i guess i am screwed!!!!
sad news!!! my plans for christmas just went out the window  sad cuz now i wont get to see my family on christmas 
just made my first ever batch of fudge  just waiting for it to set  i hope it to0urns out ok  but it will never be as good as my dads 
"thank god the boys like good movies  we all watching \dances with wolves\"" on cmt   such a good movie """
konner just informed me that for christmas he wants his two front teeth  so funny 
"everyone is equal  yeah right, that went out the damn window "
"if it weren't for my kids, i would totally skip christmas  it's just way to much stress for me "
sometimes it's nice to live with someone who can't keep their mouth closed with a secret  you are able to find things befpre you totally make a fool out of yourself
