necromorphs are great targets to get pissed off at and vent 
"admiral: lets see here  you're crazy, insane, annoying, you have ideas that scare people, and unlike most of us you think outside the box  me: and thats a bad thing how? admiral: its not  its just i kept hearing complaints about you asking people to do productive things, and that usually doesn't happen around here  anyways, log off for twenty minutes so i can talk shit about you  me: you suck "

"me: don't you just hate it when people get mad for trivial things? admiral: yeah, and since when do you use big words?? me: i always have  admiral: oh, well im mad at you now  me: dork   "
*sigh*

maybe if i watch doctor graystone get his ass beat like a bitch again ill feel better 
"admiral: okay this is what you do  get out of my face, take your head and slam it into the nearest door without getting a concussion (unless you want one) and then go sit in front of the tv and vegitate and dont think about anything but what your watching  me: do i have to slam my head into the door? admiral: humor me will you  and take video i have to see this "
what would be great at the end of mass effect is if shepard was walking from the wreckage of soverign and slipped fell and broke his neck  that would make for a very anti-climactic ending 
okay   how did radio shack get my damn email??
 annoyed 
atari: hey commander  me: hey <propfemale>  atari: why did you <propmale> name me that? me sad ause you talk a lot  atari: i do not talk alot  you just think that because your shy with everyone and the only person you ever talk to is admiral  hes a jerk anyways and no one cares what he says cause hes rude  me: exactly my point
