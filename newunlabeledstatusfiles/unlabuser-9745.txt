"so, this weekend i rode in a covered wagon and sat in the cockpit of a blackhawk helicopter   pretty effin' badass!"
"today n8 and i learned that one of the hazards of having a stainless steel carafe is that you can't see if you forgot to dump yesterday's leftover coffee    but why was i the one who had to learn that the hard way with cold coffee all over my toes, when n8's the one who forgot to dump the old stuff out?"
busy doing unpaid copywriting for a boyfriend who's obsessed with dreaming up the perfect sign to display college game day saturday morning!
"today i'm thinking positive: i am naturally good at stats  i don't need no \textbook\"" to show me how to do it """
i am going to ace my stats test today     and my leg isn't going to hurt anymore    and i have winning lottery <propfirst> to use!
"sleeping in 2 hours past my alarm wasn't how i wanted to start today, but i'm not sorry it happened "
"it took <propmale> 5 whole years to figure out there's a perfectly comfy bed to lay on in the middle bedroom of the house   5 years of <propmale> being right at the window when we get home  now n8 comes home, and where's dex?  down the hall, deep in sleep   really makes you wonder what goes on in that doggy's little pea-brain?"
"can we delay the 3 day weekend to next week? that'd fit in a little better with my schedule, kthxbye "
"bit the bullet, paid the $20 late fee, and applied to graduate in december   i am going to start requiring everyone to address me as <propfemale> <propmale>, political scientist "

"gonna eat low-carb as much as possible for awhile, so i got a shiny new grill griddle panini press machine thingy for easy indoor cooking of meat  very excited about it   time to shed the weight that's been creeping up since getting hurt in july "
someone needs to tell the people painting our next door neighbor's house that honda makes a quieter model paint-sprayer   keep thinking i hear a woman shrieking in terror 
"it might be time\to do a neighborhood intervention on fugly-painted houses  especially\green ones  first was an electric green with black trim house, next was\smoky green with disgusting yellow-beige trim (white would have been\gorgeous)  house # 3 is now lime green, trim tbd   oh yeah, and there's also a disgusting candy-banana yellow one down the road   i don't get it "
i heard my dog bark to be let in the house for the first time ever this morning 
"today i am grateful for how well thinking about what i do want (versus what i don't want) works on my focus and discipline, i'm grateful for my treadmill and for how adorable and cuddly my <propmale> is, even when he wakes me up at 2 smile 0 am for an emergency potty break "
"omg i love my new indoor grill   perfect burgers and chicken breasts in 20 <propfemale>utes (includes 10 <propfemale> heating-up time)  normally i have to wait 20 <propfemale>utes for n8 to even turn on the outdoor grill, then another 20 <propfemale> for him to clean it   !"
just found out electric six has canceled the rest of their tour   couldn't be more bummed 
wet weather= first giant trail of muddy paw prints going from kitchen to living room to living room furniture  so glad the couch is leather!
"today i am grateful for the yoga stretch that relieves my sciatic pain, and for avocados "
my boys are gonna walk me to the polling place in a few minutes!
"my doggy bled so i could vote   picked up some of the worst goatheads i've ever seen, in both front paws   sorry to the sherwin <propmale> for all the dog-blood stains on your sidewalk "
omg my neighbor is currently mowing the leaves in the street   i'm hoping he is just bored and looking for excuses to not have to help his wife with their in-home daycare   this is a whole new level of ridiculous 
"quote of the weekend:  \i put a hamburger in her tailpipe   not literally \"""""

5:16 am and i've been up for an hour   not sure whether i should be proud or sorry for myself 
still chilled to the bone from last night   sitting over a heat vent trying to thaw and make the journey to albertson's to replenish necessities such as coffee creamer and donuts 
what's better than a crappy broken dryer?  a crappy working one for only 60 bones bought out of a back-alley garden city business!
"getting ready to head over for tonight's <propmale> family thanksgiving dinner with my folks, then hitting the road for reno thanksgiving with the halls tomorrow!  can't wait! and just thin, after 6 years, this is the first thanksgiving nate and i will have ever spent together  aaawwwwwwwww   "
"just polished off a delicious diy version of flying pie's zambini pizza, now nate's at his xbox and i'm settling in for some netflixin'   tomorrow's saturday, right?  smile "
woke up with what appears to be a sinus infection  probably why i've had daily sinus headaches over the last week   ugh 
"sick as a dog, but the cold pills have greatly reduced my normal anxiety about driving in snow   nate said i have to take his truck today, and that he'd shovel the walkway and warm it up for me  smile "
"i wish stores would let you comment online about what you don't like about their clothes so they could offer better crap that i would actually be interested in buying   this would be my first post: no, jcpenney, i don't want any clothing with glitter or sparkles because i'm a grown-ass woman "
"just noticed there's a channel playing reruns of \martin \""      i can finally check that off the list of huge voids in my life """
"woke up early to \give myself the gift of aerobic exercise\"" but got distracted trying to self-diagnose my swollen tonsil  i poked at the tonsil so much that i gave myself the gift of a sore throat """
"on second thought, skipping my run this morning due to a <propmale> gut ache may have been counter-productive "
i am sooooooooooo ready to get my final over with  c'moooon 1pm!
"why yes, after sampling a cookie from each of the boise branches today, i do need a nap!"
new neighbors goin' in across the street   wonder how long before this couple breaks up and the dude's in jail  
"nate just got to be a \hero\"" to the new neighbor   poor kid locked herself out in her jammies with no shoes coat and nate found a window he could pop open and lift her into  we don't know if she has roomies yet but we're breathing a sigh of relief that she seems nice and normal """
yoga videos on netflix instant = perfect way to relax on a sunday afternoon from the comfort of my living room!
"all i want for chrismas is to watch christmas movies, listen to christmas music, and eat cookies "

just got back from walking <propmale> and bouncing rocks off the iced-over pond at veteran's memorial park   nate almost got one rock all the way to the other side   chilly but fun!
there's almost no mood nor headache that can't be cured by walking 2 <propmale> around the neighborhood with my boys 
"toddlers & tiaras: hilarious entertainment, with a good message  the message? i'm sooooo not ready for kids!!!"

"got in a 3 mile workout today, despite not having had a full day off since the 9th (and won't until the 22nd)   maybe those 15 yr old girls' energy levels rubbed off on me   "
"text from my dad: \yur mother has been txting me for the the last hour   she is txt crazy now \""  text from my brother: \""teaching mom to text  pretty sure i'm never having kids \"""""
"thank you, friday, just for being you  smile      now its time to decide if i want to push myself this weekend to get things done that i couldn't do last weekend, or lay around the house every possible minute "
i find it delightful that <propmale> loves steamed broccoli 
the upside of living next to an in-home daycare: watching two full-grown men blow kisses at each other from across the street  (disclaimer: they were trying to get their kids to blow kisses at eachother)
came home from work with piriformis pain  broken furnace ended up being an even worse pain in the @$$   i would from hereon advise all homeowners to never replace their thermostat themselves 
"just did an awesome 3 5 mile walk around the block  february, keep these gorgeous days a'comin'!"
