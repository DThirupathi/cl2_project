the weekend is calling my name   
"some people's status just amaze me sometimes  isn't it ironic that everything that you might have been looking for was right in front of your face the whole time and u never knew it?the quote of the night is, \don't look a gift horse in the mouth\"" """
can't wait to go home    
i miss her a lot  idk why     i just do 
less than two weeks to go   
this summer is not ending the way that i e playful ected   
"girl don't u know, ur so beautiful  i wanna give all my love to u girl  not just tonight, but the rest of ur life  i wanna be always here by ur side     -musiq soulchild"
i wonder if i did something wrong   
i wonder if she's ever gonna realize    
if you say so    
i'm so glad that i'm back   
i should've gotten her number    damn
can't wait for monday!!!
last night was legit   
i hope things go my way this time    
"when it comes to decision making, i am sorely lacking in judgement  i hope i make the right moves    "
doin some last minute packing    can't wait to get out of here 
second day of class  last cuts in six days    this is gonna be really interesting
can't believe its my birthday already    im finally legal lol
can't wait to transfer   
"practice went well, but i really hurt my knee  hopefully it's not serious "
1 day at a time  the end of the semester will be here before u know it   
i don't understand why everything always has to be so complicated    
fire drill at midnight  just got back to my dorm    this kind of crap only happens at hampton 
i don't know why i can't get her off my mind  this is not what i need right now     
its never gonna happen   
it's never gonna happen   
is jamin' to the new paramore cd    
had a good start to the weekend  smile 
we all learn to make mistakes and run from them with no conviction  we're just one of those ghosts    
why is my life so boring    
???    
that was a weird ending of the night   
8 1 2 more weeks    
i'm finally off of curfew  this weekend is gonna be crazy    
never got that skype chat  i'm hurt   
never got that skype chat  i'm hurt    
some random chick who lives in australia started talking to me on skype and started saying some really weird things to me     i don't know if i should feel shocked awed or disgusted right now 
"i can't believe i actually got in!!! cnu, here i come    "
say what u need to say 
sometimes i honestly feel like my parents' job in life is to make my life more miserable than it already is 
i really hope she doesn't   
i need a break from school   
gladly   
"i'm sooooo ready for the turkey, cornbread, <propmale> & cheese, little sausage wraps, stuffing and pumpkin pie    "
"i just wanted to let u know that i haven't forgotten, i'm just having a hard time figuring out how i'm going to settle the score   "
thank you for havin' my back <propmale> lol 
i can't wait to go home!!!
"if i don't see certain people over break, i'm gonna be highly upset    "
i wonder if anyone will call me and see if i wanna chill   
thanksgiving break was interesting 
"i really don't know what to think    ima try to let it go  if things are meant to happen, then they will "
"i just don't understand why the people closest to u are the ones who end up hurting u the most    is it really worth it? well on another note, i'm really anxious to find out what the future holds, if i have one at all  only god knows"
"so am i ever gonna get a proper response to that honesty box message??? just wondering lol  (haha jk, jk)"
"is she worth the time and energy that it's gonna take to prove that i'm the right guy? absolutely     now is the feeling mutual??? that's the million dollar question  chances are slim to none, but i can keep hoping until she tells me no "
only got a couple of days left    then the craziness begins  smile 
i can't wait for class to be over so i can go to sleep   
i can't believe i'm getting braces     annoyed 
1 <propfirst> 4:18
<propmale> 19:6
life is really interesting     u never know what's coming next and i like that 
i wonder how different my life would be if i had stayed in oriskany   
happy holidays
whats a good conversation starter for a girl u don't know???
lol    last time i checked it was girls are like buses    (<propfirst> feat  gucci   break up)
why is ashburn so boring???
u-m flint is lookin pretty good right about now    who knows  i might change my mind and go to raddy after all 
radford it is   
<propfirst> swift won album of the year over beyonce and lady gaga    what is this world coming to!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
i better not have class tomorrow  i'm sooooo bored  i wanna get out my house and do something as soon as humanly possible   
"somebody keyed the entire hood of my brand new car  u know what    i thought i'd be a lot more upset about this, but whats the point? getting angry and frustrated over trying to figure out who and why anybody would do that is futile    but if i do ever find out who did it, they will pay, and not in cash "
<propfirst>'s day sucks   
"i don't wanna hate nobody tonight, but they keep pushin' me   "
i got my first ticket today  on top of that i didn't have the money to pay a toll 15 days ago  i just remembered that i still haven't sent in my 75 cents to the v-dot  i was just reading the receipt and it said that after 10 days u have to pay an additional $25 dollars  i'm broke  not to mention that i haven't  told my parents about either misfortune and am probably going to catch hell    fml
loves <propfemale> devaughn

it's time for me to grow up   
"hmmmm  very, very interesting    "

"they say i was the obamination of obama's nation, well thats a pretty bad way to start a conversation    "
"to any one who has sent me a txt or called me within the last 24 hours: sorry i haven't responded, but i seem to have lost my phone "
"please start doin u, i've been doin me  im a staple in my city u can never ruin me   "
"â€œthe most terrible poverty is loneliness, and the feeling of being unloved â€�"
"â€œyou can close your eyes to the things you don't want to see, but you can't close your heart to the things you don't want to feel â€�"
words can't describe how amazing it feels to have the weight of the world lifted off of your shoulders   
just gotta stay on my grind   
i love the way u smile   
so whats the point of having a 4 day weekend if i have no one to spend it with? probably gonna be stuck at home playin cod or at work  very disappointing   
time to man up   
lmao
"hu game, then jmu tmrw     or technically today"
"i wish i could say whats really on my mind, but that would cause too many problems   "
"let's stay together 'til we're ghosts \i want to witness love, i never seen it close \yeah, but i guess i gotta find it first \that's why i'm really going off, fireworks\\- drake"
just gotta stay focused  i can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel    
why does fate hate me so much? just curious   
i finally figured out    its about time 
"wow, where do ppl get this crap from?"
leh go
"right place, wrong time = my life in a nut shell"
"i'm chillin', but my swag's on full attack    i just can't get her off my mind "
"i'm chillin', but my swag's on full attack    i just can't get her off my mind "
i just wanna know why this keeps happening to me over and over again 
<propfemale> waddell is so cool  smile

this has been an interesting night   
"life is like a balancing act between living in the moment and focusing on your future  you only live once, so make sure that you strive for both to the best of your ability   "
"ok <propfemale>, i get it   "
thanksgiving break is gonna be sooooo legit this year 
"so, its gonna be like that??? why am i not surprised    "
about to go black friday shopping    this is gonna be interesting 
"for once, i don't think things could be going any better  smile \hopefully i didn't just jinx myself lol "
i don't think i could put everything thats on my mind in 1 status so i put a video up instead  im gonna have to try this more often   
loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty    
"wow, really??? that was the last straw    "
the way i feel = beyond comprehension
i love how you can go from one extreme to the next in a flash  it's the story of my life 
all i want for christmas is you   
how does a phone just disappear out of thin air? this is ridiculous     i will be without a cell phone until further notice
