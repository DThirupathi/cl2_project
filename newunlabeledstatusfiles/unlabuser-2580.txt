quiz wars are so much fun    
what do you do when someone you love more than anything gets hurt by the hands of someone that claims love and adoration of the one you love? do you stand up knowing you or someone you care for dearly could get hurt? or do you let that fear keep you silent and obedient?

"the problem with love is, that you can love anyone you want, but so can he "
