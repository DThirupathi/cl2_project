everybody better be freaking careful  drunk punks are driving on the wrong side of the road 
i think i figured out the moonwalk   it hurts my toes after a while though 
"so, i woke up early to make some cinnamin rolls and what do i find? some freaking landmines left on the stairs for me to step on   i hate this dog   "
"burred, boord, boared, bored!"
trapped in my basement because my sister's party has taken over the house  so   bored   
got my feel-good music and my feel-good snackage   i'm chillin good 
just got a sweet laptop  it's crazy   but now it's time to get rid of all the bloatware 
up for hangin out tomorrow   you'll probably have to call and wake me up though 
just rearranged my room   my internal clock must hate me right now 
"i know that i almost have all the time in the world, but i still feel rushed "
"tired, bored, and i don't want to go to bed   weird "
"you know, you're not really \hacked\"" if you actually gave you're password to someone else   just thought i'd throw that out there """
just realized that today is the 4th   
you know you're lame when you would rather continue beating up your xbox to get it to work than pay for repairs 
"gah!, it just hit me that everyone i grew up with in the last few years is leaving!"
"heheh, my xbox is wrecked "
tornadoes!!!
holy crap! if almond snickers taste like heaven i can only wonder what normal snickers taste like 
   did i miss something? why is everybody turning into cartoons?!
