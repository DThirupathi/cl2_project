"dont live in the past or the future live today in this moment   its hard tho not to worry about the future about where we will end up, in school or not, have a job or not, be in a relationship, or even having a place to live  i have my future lined up but things happen and sometimes throw you way off into other directions"
i want to have a good day with <propfirst> smile 
"people are always in a rush to get older and once they are older they wish they were younger, i say live your age im not in a rush to get older nor do i want to be younger  i will be turning 18 next month it doesnt feel like much but for my mom and the eyes of the law its a big step"
"i get my car soon but the thing is i dont really care if i get it, right now id probably only use it to see my little sister, to help <propfirst> and to go to school"
i miss him and love him more than words can e playful lain
time can break us or heal us  i pray that it will heal us
i hate to say this but im so glad to get these fuckers locked up and out of my life for good  now i can move on and not always worry about my safety

"will he make me feel safe, protect me from the demons in this world, hold me when im scared or crying    "
