"not only successfully engaged the entire fish sorting staff in the fish dance, but also managed to call fish from the sky in the process"
"that was the third person to compare my dancing to lady gaga, good thing or bad?"
"thank you everyone for the birthday wishes, and thank you to the people that planned the party for me, i'm sorry i wasn't home to enjoy it   i promise i will be back soon though and we will do something epic to make it up    love  you guys"
