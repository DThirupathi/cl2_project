super sweet weather today
i spent 32 dollars in gas today and i have to fill up before work tomorrow  what's the point of even having a job if it goes straight to the tank? i made 234 dollars just in hourly in 2 weeks  after barack obama took some taxes i was only given 120  that  is  gay 
the government is shutting down? my 9 year old brother pouts and shuts down too 
saw <propfirst> last night  i think i might have a new favorite movie  dude is hilarious 
if your hungry and happen to be near a tgifridays then go cuz they have a huge part of the menu that comes with $10 gift cards for a $9 meal  it ends may 15

yaaaa    about last night lol
so it's been about 3 weeks so i'm not surprised i lost my wallet  just awesome   
bow-chicka-bowow-watcha gonna say!
the best part of spring break  i've finally gone to bed earlier than 2 and woke up later than 7 
there's something special about today but i just can't quite put my finger on it 
i have a new respect for apple  i put my headphones in the dryer and they still worked 
i was on my way back from delivering pizza and i passed this guy riding a bike and trying to drink a water bottle at the same time  this dude hit something and did a motocross front flip landing on his face and soaked himself with his water bottle  i had a very important meeting to be at so i couldn't stop and help
