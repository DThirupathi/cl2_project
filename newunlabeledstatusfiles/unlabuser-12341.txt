a word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice    
"people say good people don't know what temptation means  this is an obvious lie  only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is     a person who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later  that is why bad people, in a sense, know very little about badness  they have lived a sheltered life by always giving in "
"see, the problem is that god gives men a brain and a penis, and only enough blood to run one at a time   and even then, the blood is biased   "

protip: never interrupt your opponent while he's making a mistake   that'd be rude 
"everyone has the ability of making someone happy, some by entering the room, others by leaving it  then there is me    i come in the room, grab some food, and then leave the room "
"the truth many people never understand, until its too late, is that the more you try to avoid suffering the more you suffer because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you in proportion to your fear of being hurt  so what do we do? anything  something  so long as we just don't sit there  if we screw it up, try something else  if we wait until we've satisfied all uncertainties, it may be too late "
