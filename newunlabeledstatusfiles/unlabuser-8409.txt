some people should learn to keep there mouths shut if they dont know what the fuck their talking about!
so to set the story straight since some bitches think that they know everything (yeah this is aimed at you)  first off we did get suspended but it wasn't because of what you heard about (e playful   we made a porno or something [where the fuck do you get that from])  the truth is   yes we did make a video but it didn't have anything like that in it  we got suspended because honestly we cussed a lot in it
