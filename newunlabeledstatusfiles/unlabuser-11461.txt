i tried but you failed   
you cant always get what you want 
i dont need you to agree with my choices but i do need you to respect them 
i gotta make you see theres no one else here no one like me 
its my dads birthday today and the packers play the vikings couldn't ask for a better sunday   well     wish it was a little nicer outside butcha cant have it all 
i think its funny on all the news feeds that matthews is returning for tonights game   vikings fans are the first to post something   and then they continue to say why is he playing hes just going to get hurt again   or somethin along the lines of how gb will still come up with an excuse for not winning   well ya must be concerned if ya looked to see if the big boy was gonna play or not          
favre needs to put that gb jersey back on atleast then he'll be throwin to the right team 
is headed to the store to buy a box of klenex for all the vikings fans i come across today 
i want you to want      me     wait whos writing this? i want you to leave me alone  yup that sounds better &hearts;
well this should be interesting let the mud bowl begin come on shell lake whoop some (facebook edit)

sometimes a girl cant be tamed she needs to find someone just as wild to join her in her adventure 
come on over drink my beer waste my time tell me lies i wont believe kick me to the ground and kiss me when ya get me down if ya think ill fall for that again 
my life and what i decide to do with it is none of your business anymore  you made that decision  deal with it 
so apparently this is how it works for some people    they want the person they like to think they are happy with someone else    way to rock that shit! fail
"i respect your opinions in life, your choices dont you think its about time you respect mine! back the f--k up b---h!"
i dont put up with crap and i watch my 6 if that pisses ya off and makes ya hate me too bad 
you dont get another <propmale> when its over its over  do the things you want while you can 
you go down on your knees decide you've had enough  you get mad you get strong whipe it off then you stand 
say what you mean to say dont sugar coat the truth  dont pretend its somethin else you need when its 1 thing you're after

she likes deer stands beer cans she baits her own hook when she fishes 
if we spent just half the time caring for ourselves as we do trying to hate and ruin other peoples lives we'd sure be a hell of a lot happier! maybe ya'll should give it a try 
if you try sometimes ya just might find you get what you need 
"country strong, hard to break and i wont stay down long "
