life kinda really sucks at the moment
look i am really struggling at the moment   i am doing everything i can to save money but i still don't have enough to buy food   my frig is pretty empty and so is my pantry   ugh living on your owns sucks sometimes 
"sorry everyone  due to the fact that i can't afford nothing anymore i had to cancel everything at home  so no tv, home phone or internet for me  since i can't get to the library as often as i like anymore i am deleting all online accounts except my email "
ok i am going to try this again
this seems so much more complicated than myspace
yup like myspace better 
it might just take awhile  i like the layout of myspace better 
ahhhhhhhhhh why is life soooo confusing?
well i am home today because i woke up with a severe asthma attack and had to go to the hospital  wow i hate being sick 
i feel like shit  i hate being sick  it always makes my asthma flare up   jeez 
well i am finally starting to feel better  i can breath again  oh yeah  so not looking forward to the snow mess we are getting this monday  again yuck 
i started working over night this week  today is day number two  it sucks  but atleast i only do it for a week 
i really hate when my heart gets played with  why must you continue to stomp on it  what happened to all the nice guys in the world?
sorry if i am not the girl you use to know  people change deal with it 
why yes it is indeed snowing here again 
so the weather has been wonderful all week  spring is just around the corner  yea!!!
this week has been crazy  first i had to work in another store that was soooo horrible  then my friend passes away  i have trouble sleeping  i met someone that is totally awesome and he breaks his collarbone  ouch

totally bored 
i so need a new profile pic  need someone to take it though  i don't like the ones i take 
it is hot as all hell today

when your lies come back to bite you in the ass you should be looking at your own mouth because you were the one who spouted the lies  nothing like biting your own ass 
i feel horrible today 
so totally happy  i got awesome news today 
oh it is sooooooooooo hot outside  yuck 
i really hate not having a car  walking everywhere sucks big time 
sorry i haven't been on here in awhile  i hope everyone is doing good  happy holidays 
lol if you haven't seen me at walmart it might be because i don't stand still for one minute   it has been soooooooooo freakin busy on the front end i want to cry 
its all good though after this day is over i have two days off in a row  i am sleeping those days away  i need it 
ah to have two days off in a row  i don't know what i will do with myself 
i hate snow 
i really don't feel like working today  wish it was tomorrow cuz i have off that day  come on monday  hurry up and get here 
"i am soooooooooooooooooooo fucking sick  i have a sinus infection so bad, i have a headache, my teeth hurt, and my ears hurt  i can barely talk  i have to keep my mouth open because if i close my mouth it hurts really bad  i am on antibiotics, but i don't know if i will be able to work tomorrow   sad "
my fever is high at the moment  i am sooooooo hot that even my eyes are burning  this really sucks 
"why am i soooooo sick? i think i am going to throw up, my stomach hurts so bad  my throat hurts and i can barely talk "
"i did go to the doctors  i have a severe sinus infection  the pressure in my sinus' was soooo bad  i had a headache for two days, my teeth hurt(i could close my mouth), and my ears hurt "
i am slowly getting better  yeah i hate being sick

today is moving day  totally excited  i still have a couple trips to make 
i moved to taneytown 
i get my car in two weeks  yeah car!!!!
<propfemale>  smile 
i really hate being sick  why me 
the doctor thinks i might have diverticulitis  i have to get blood work and an x-ray tomorrow to confirm  my abdomen hurts so bad 
well had to go to the hospital for severe pain  it isn't diverticulitis but they are thinking it is ulcers now  so monday i have to set up an appt with a gi doctor  i'll keep y'all posted 
i hate my life  like i really need stomach ulcers now  it's bad enough i suffered from stomach problems all my life  i don't have a gallbladder or an appendix anymore  it should have all stopped dammit  so of course i am loopy right now because i had to take my perococet for the pain 
i am finally starting to feel somewhat better  can't wait to go to the doctors friday  hopefully he has something to tell me 
ok people i was right  i had to take a pain killer after work today  walmart is killing me and we at work have named it the blue death  tuesday i get my endoscopy done to pretty much confirm that i have stomach ulcers 
well people i said i would give you an update when i got my endoscopy done  it's not good  well i don't have stomach ulcers  which is good i guess  but come to find out my stomach is not digesting the way it is supposed to  i apparently still had food in my stomach from the day before  now mind you the last time i had eaten was like more then 12 hours before the test  so that doesn't sound to good to me 
i got my car  yeah!!!!!!! i got a 2008 nissan versa  this car is awesome 
oh and another update on my stomach  i go the 24th to get a 5 hour test done   sad  i will let you know what happens when i go back to see the doc about a week after the test is done  ugh i just hope it is easily fixable 
another update  i had my other test done on thursday  well it took four hours for my stomach to fully empty  now i have to wait till april 6th before i go back to the gi doctor to get some kind of diagnosis
