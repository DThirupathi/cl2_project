"okay, fyi to everyone who i didn't text, i am extremely tired, my body aches, i am depressed, and 10 days late  between that and hypno-therapy i am pretty much not really up for a lot  don't get me wrong, i love you all, i am just, snapping a lot    i am sorry"
why is it that someone always has to tell you who you are or what you feel    i swear to god i know myself better then anyone else   scarey thought actually
"i don't have the strength to lie anymore i've spent my life taking all the wrong doors i think i have the answers questions remains, still here on the outside covered in pain  so magnify the light that shines threw my window i can see so clearly in your eyes, justify the night and oh baby let it go, need to feel you near me no more lies, bring me to life, bring me to life bring me to life with a newborn heart"
"so i <propmale> out with lime and she recorded her voice for her ringtone   and for all text messages saying \bubbles my bubbles\"" for my text    i just got a text and nearly jumped outta my chairs  """
it going to be a long night    at least i have tons of my online college & therapy work to catch up on i've been slacking for a month  
"i don't have the strength to lie anymore i've spent my life taking all the wrong doors i think i have the answers questions remains, still here on the outside covered in pain  so magnify the light that shines threw my window i can see so clearly in your eyes, justify the night and oh baby let it go, need to feel you near me no more lies, bring me to life, bring me to life bring me to life with a newborn heart"
god damn it i cant stop crying agter therapy
heh eating ravioli ouuta a can with garlic and black pepper    and actually thinking it tastes good    weird
i am sorry my love is completely meaningless cause i am not who you think i should be but that doesn't mean i love you less
feels so much better after venting to <propfemale>! thanks <propfemale>
"got a call from my brother <propfirst>, <propfirst> missing please pray  i'm panicking right now"
if you love me prove it if not go away i dont need people purposely wasting my time
"i am not prepared for today, at all    i am outta it and go two shoots today with no idea what to where    bebekah"
"damn this hurts a lot, but anyways new pictures what ya think? me i am undecided, but i want everyone's opinion"
"i want to write you and tell you i am sorry, but it'll do no good   why try when nothing will change or get better"
i gotta get out of this house for a bit i can't breath
"got into a fight over <propfirst>, started crying, made the mistake of unblocking my phone, now i still upset over worrying about my stepdaughter, listening to whispers in the dark which is the only thing comforting me is that song     something wrong if that is my comfort  if you know the story behind that song and me, you'll get it why it shouldn't help me"
"you know, i am pretty bless, i have an amazing god, that given me some of the best friends that stupid by myself for every war i fought     <propfemale>, <propfemale>, brannon, & <propmale>  not many people can say they have 4 good friends "
"so, this is like <propfemale> right? i have a month of minimal work then i much have to get slammed? lol guess it could be worse but everything this week  tomorrow my lightest day    at least the green tea helped my nausea "
going to bekah's
im dating bekah now i belong to her no one else
i have no idea where i would be if i didn't met <propfemale> hill in march of 2009  we've been throw hell together (and plus some) and she really is an amazing friend and i love her very much  for better or worse she's my lime  
"i had a random memory tonight     all i gotta say is      purr     god i miss that  night all, it is way past my bed time "
"sometimes it takes a moment to realize that what you think you want isn't healthy, and there is nothing that you do about it, other then to just living your life and enjoying your friends, and just, move on   "
"all the words in my head, thinking of everything i want to say, but somehow it doesn't seem relevant in my life  i have this bad idea from straying from where i need to be,"
"i went to a church by me and let this little boy play with my phone    sorry to everyone he called   he managed to call someone i didn't want called that not so understanding    heh    on a side note, i am watching <propmale> now which is like the best along with leverage"
"i am putting down my sword and shield, i am tired of fight this war, i shouldn't be fighting with someone i love over something so trivial and stupid and i wont do it   fight all you want, but for me, i am done, i love you and you mean a lot to me   that i wont continue the fighting"
i either got the flu or got myself so upset that i made myself sick    but i am sick either way    and wish i could just cuddle up with some green tea and hate like the rest of the world doesn't matter other then the one or two people
has just installed the 'my kids' application
i like it by the door
"\her feelings she hides her dreams she can't find she's losing her mind she's falling behind she can't find her place she's losing her faith she's falling from grace she's all over the place\"""""
"   the look-alike meter off     there no way <propmale> can look more like <propfirst> by -24%    and <propfirst> looks more like him by 16%, have they seen my kids?"
"i don't wanna sleep, blah, the nightmares are bad, heh    stress   "
thinks this is completely pointless to try at somethings anymore when it clearly doesn't matter
i am completely and totally in love     and it completely and totally doesn't matter   
beh
"im the type of girl that says \what did i do now\"" and honestly have no idea why im in trouble     is that bad"""
"i love you <propfemale> hill get better soon please, you don't even look like you, i am praying for you and will see you in the morning at 6am! i love you my lime"
i just realized how much i changed    and how much some people mean to me    i am so odd
i am not a morning person    
"not sure why my heart been racing all day and why i feel so bad but when i feel asleep i had the best most vivid dream that i was actually in the arms of the guy i love and everything felt so real    i didn't want to wake up  but i got forced to not only wake up, but to eat subway too  i guess me sleeping throw my phone for 6 hours scared someone i miss him so much & i love him  my heart still racing though  damn it"
ok so the rest of my day i am wearing my special upset tshirt and hiding in my bed    i hope
having a blast at cowboys!

"had a bad day but ya know what it's going to be okay  i got the most amazing people there for me every step of the way, rather its my fam & friends, <propfemale> hill, <propfemale> <propfirst>, <propfemale>, <propfemale> ganger white or at the family center,  <propfemale>, <propfemale> & <propfemale>  i grateful for them being there for me   sorry i am distance when i am upset"
at the hospital with lime    spending the day here with her    get better soon bekah i love you
"i cant fall in love cause im already in love, and just because he is physically not beside me doesnt mean i love him any less"
"amused    not mad just amused    i guess in all honesty things are changing so fast for me, and then i turn around and listen to someone going off (phone wise), and really some people never change  and am content to know that very soon there involvement is changing and they are to blind or stupid to see it"
something wrong with saber
i need to find quack-quack for <propfirst>    *she called crying for losing him* and get saber better   and get <propfemale> safe     among many many other things
"jez    for him not talking to be, he is sure in my dreams a lot    so much for forgeting"

"how could i give my heart away all over, when you taken everything left of me that i had to give you never said it's over when you disappeared, all through the night all alone in my sleep, and i wish i could let you go, well it's finding that i can't live if i don't"

"2 more days then fri, sat, & sun off then mon tues <propfemale> then done with training    not like i am not done with cbl's already but hey"
"i am going to bed early tonight, keeping my bedtime and waking up for work before the sun wore me out and it's not good for my brain,  all i can think about is the things i know i can't say, it kinda sucks   i do better fulling rested in distracting myself"

"wow, i am tired, but it feels so good to be back to work,  odd concept but things seem to go so much fast & oddly mentally i am better, busy has i can get but mentally i am ok"

"we'd give my life to protect you, but yet you insist on hiding and lying to us, how can we be a team if you wont open up  i hope you realize how disappointed i am in you, where ever you are    your just like the person you hate, your just like him, just running and hiding, and yet we love you both til death"
"god damn it, i got you outta my head til i heard this damn song, why does everything have to be so complex, can your stay outta my head? heh sadly can't even blame you, you did disappear"

"your so far away but so close in my heart, i'm in love like nothing ever changed, maybe that is just how it's meant to be, i miss you more then you realize   i know i fell in love much harder then you did, cause it's not that easy for me to leave, or to forget you  but then again, girls are more emotional then boys  i have my life, but nothing can take your place, my love~"
