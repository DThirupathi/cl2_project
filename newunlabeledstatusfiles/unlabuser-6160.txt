"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear  while you humiliate, offend, and insult her, there's a man wanting to remind her how beautiful she is  while you hurt her, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away  while you make her cry, there's a man wanting to see smiles from her     please repost this if you are against domestic violence and mental abuse"
