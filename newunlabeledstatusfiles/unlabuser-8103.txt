not the best odea to go to bed at 7 smile 0am on new years day    but it was the most fun i've had this year   
my minds an open book yours to decifer    have fun 
"after watching the nfc championship i hoped the vikings would win but i think its for the better they lost favre looked exhausted, i don't think he would have survived the super bowl "
with football almost over and no pittsburgh team left in the picture all i have to say is lets go pens!!!
two in one year one a friend the other an aquaintence please god no one else 
i am the most social antisocial person i know  how does that work?
if being random was illegal i would be americas mosts wanted 
snow shoveling    what a pain in the back 
"the super bowl, the holy grail of sporting events  only problem it not a cup so technically wouldn't the stanly cup have to be the holy grail of sporting event?"
i acctualy want to go back to school! the snow needs to either stop or at least snow less 
epic free for all airsoft battle with any and <propmale>    i won!
will this snow ever stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
city and state authorities say they dont know where to put all this snow    i do  one word vancouver! !
"\nuf everybody i know you cant believe jamaica we have a bobsled team\"" -sanca (cool runnings)"""
"friends, you love them, you hate, and you put up with theirs quirks, but you would'nt trade them for anything "
lifes more fun if you know were your going but not nececarily how to get their  you need to pick the rout you think is best 
"so aparently falling six feet and catching yourself has the same results, to a lesser extent as hitting your head off the floor    minus the whole bruising issue  thanks to everyone that checked to make sure me and <propmale> were ok i realy appreciated it "
"i don't think i remembered what my house looked like in daylight, just twilight and darkness    i have'nt been home before 8 for the past two weeks "
"opening night of \beauty and the beast\"" went great  had a blast cant wait for tommarow and sunday!"""
theres nothing like going to your first track practice of the season and learning your swimming    and then realiseing yiu dont have your swimsuit  uhg
legs are so tired i cant feel them    until i move them  so can i get away with saying i cant feel my legs?
"daylights savings time and me have a love hate relationship    love the sun being up later, hate it coming up later    oh and the whole loose an hour of sleep thing is not the greates to, especialy when you realize that it is 12am when you think its 11pm "
"so sucessfuly managed to suprise myself, and the reat of the track team, by running a 30o in 42seconds    yeah im not a sprinter and that was better than some of their time where did that come from?"
so just found out today that the 300 i ran was 2seconds slower then thans    what have i gotten myself into now?
"so, basicaly i've been told by every coach that i've gotten stronger and faster  looks like this year i'll be a multi event person  jumper and a sprinter "
"so apperently must be doing alot better to every coach for track  i've always jumped, but now i will sprint and i guess be tested to see if i can run the 800  i notice some difference but not this much    im not used to the attention!"
"saturday playful ractice at 9am home by 12, hopefuly  agenda for rest of day, relax and recover!"
theres nothing like running out side and have a lightning bolt light up the sky to make you turn around and run back inside    especialy when <propfemale> are te tallest thing out there 
night time sharpens heightens each sensation  darkness wakes and stirs imagenation   
close your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth and the truth isnt what you want to see  in the dark it is easy to pretend that the truth is what it ought to be 
there's nothing like haveing that strange feeling if being watched only to turn around and and find that you are 
pointless day of school tomarrow  first 2 hour late start then one hour athletic early dismissal  woohoo 5 hour school day    then probably 5 hour track meet
