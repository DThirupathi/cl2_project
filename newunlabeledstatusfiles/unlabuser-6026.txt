"overthe last year, i have used facebook to hold some pretty controversial conversations about religion, politics, and history  i am greatful for all of the people who have been courageous enough to share their oppinions, intelligent enough to defend them, and understanding enough not to demonize those with other views "
is anyone else watching and laughing at the speaker of house's reactions to the president  this mess is funny 
"is he gonna do it, is he tearing up? nope back to lookin salty"
"i am looking forward to voting for him again, not because i am overly blinded by his charisma or color, but because i know what to e playful ect from him  the president cares and is working to get things done  no matter how you view his policies, you have to believe he cares, and he does what he says "
"i feel bad for representative <propfirst>  he had to follow president obama with this crap  i would have rather him just say \ no comment\"" or cosign with the president   step your speech game up gop"""
"one of the great things about the us army officer education system is our opportunity for interaction with other officers around the world  at this time, i cant help but think of my former classmates and instructors in australia, pakistan, lebenon, egypt, and all over  we see things on the news and forget that there are real good people fighting to hold their worlds together "
"my prayer is that god would build me to be a man whose deeds change the world, and whose words lead others, in this generation and those to come, to do the same   "
"happy black history month everyone!!! this is easily my favorite time of the year, not because it appeals my enhanced sense of militant pride, but because the dream of dr woodson is still alive today, telling us that the greatness of the least of us is the greatness of all of us  \when you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his actions\""- dr cg woodson"""
"i have decided not to share black history nuggets to celebrate black history month  i will instead continue to share so great quotes from figures in black history  while i love the many great deeds done by our ancestors, i believe their words, or motivation for those deeds is often lost  the greatness of the persons deeds is often just an extension of their character "
"\somehow we are going to have to develop a concept of enough for those at the top and at the bottom so that the necessities of the many are not sacrificed for the luxury of the few   service is the rent we pay for living  it is the very purpose of life and not something you do in your spare time\""-marian wright freeman   i love this month!"""
"as the agitation which culminated in the abolition of african slavery in this country covered a period of fifty years, so may we e playful ect that before the rights conferred upon us by the war amendments are fully conceded, a full century will have passed away    we have undertaken a serious work which will tax and exhaust the best intelligence and energy of the race for the next century\-timothy fortune"""
"\the south's historians served the cause of southern nationalism with more lasting effect than did its armies   southerners must win with the pen what they had failed to win the sword   my challenge was to eave into the fabric of american history enough of the presence of blacks so that the story of the united states could be told adequately and fairly \""--john hope frankin"""
watched a speech by fdr yesterday and was reminded why he was my second favorite president  oddly enough my favorite shares his last name
"some times i worry that deep down im a villain  why are my favorite characters in movies, the ones i identify with most, the bad guys (hannibal, the joker in dark night, and <propfirst> corleone) watching the godfather, and lovin it as always, even though they say some foul mess about black folk "
"in every race, in every nation, and in every clime in every period of history there is always an eager-eyed group of youthful patriots who seriously set themselves to right the wrongs done to their race, or nation or sect, or sometimes to <propmale> or self-e playful ression  no race or nation can advance without them --alice dunbar-nelson"
"the great thing about valentines day is that it isnt just a celebration of love right now, it is a celebration of what love has always been, its a day to appreciate all of the lessons, all of the memories, all of the power  to that aim, happy valentines day to my great thing, the sweet in my tea: mrs, <propfemale> <propmale>  to my first <propfirst> :rev <propfemale> <propmale>  and everyone else who has invested in me "

"the protest in egypt, libya, tunisa, yemen, and bahrain teach us a few things  1  diplomacy is not easy  being a friend of the nation can sometimes pit you against your own beliefs  2  every human being wants a voice, regardless of their culture or religion  3  barack obama did more in spreading democracy in the middle east with one speech than <propfirst> bush did with two wars  the pen is still  mightier than the sword "
"pessimism is at its core cowardice  it requires and risk nothing  it offers only the obvious possibility of failure  however, optimism is a continuous e playful ression of mental courage  it requires the vision to see the potential in all, the compassion to relate to all, and the sacrifice of hoping for the best, when the worst is so prevalent  today i want to encourage as many people as i can, be optimistic and smile "
"attacking cultural issues with the power of the purse under the auspices of fiscal responsibility is both immoral and ingenious using dollars to fight battles that your rhetoric couldn't win isn't new  i do find it funny that people  believe that cutting money to poor people to pay for tax cuts to <propmale> people is right  part of me is mad at the politicians, but the real in me says \hustle well executed\"""""
"so proud of my dog  he ripped a pitbull off of a shepherd puppy who was being attacked  then just pinned him  while i still think he is a jerk sometimes, i'm proud he is a leader dog who protects the small ones  good job boy!"
just watched precious for the first time   wow   
"\let racism be a problem to someone else   let it drag them down  don't use it as an excuse for your own shortcomings   all work is honorable  - gen c  powell"""
"1)it aint as bad as you think  it will look better in the morning \2)avoid having your ego so close to your position that, when your position fails, your ego goes with it \3)don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision \4)you can't make someone else's choices  you shouldn't let someone else make yours \5)don't take counsel of your fears or naysayers \6)perpetual optimism is a force multiplier "

"felt so hype about my new stuff, i grabbed a sigma shirt, my sigma belt, some blue and white and1's, my new sigma jacket, and my new sigma chain just to go to the lab   thats right, almost 9 years in and still dressin like a neo!"
"today is a great day to attend the university of north <propfemale> at chapel hill  they won the acc title and smashed duke  if you know me, you know how much, i absolutely hate that school (only like coach k and the colors) thanks tarheels for giving me something to celebrate"
"it is a sad day to love <propfemale>  not just because of the brazen attack on worker rights in wisconsin(again hustle well executed) but mostly because of these un<propfemale>n hearings on the radicalization of <propfemale>n muslims  if anyone has to e playful lain how this is offensive to humanity and completely opposite to the foundation of <propfemale>, there is allot more we need to be ashamed of   some times there are no words "
"psa to dog owners: if your dog is under 3 lbs it is a small dog and needs to go to the small dog park  also, just cause i dominate my dog, doessnt mean your dog gets to mess with him  you are very lucky i didnt let him go and eat your little dog when your dog started trying to bite mine"
"today my little sister is 27 and my god-son is 12  its funny because people used to think <propfirst> and i are twins, and they say christian is the new and improved model  coincidence that they are both born on the same day    i think not  happy birthday <propfirst> and christian! enjoy your day!"
"my first battle <propmale>, my first psg gets his long overdue promotion to e-8 ( considering 8 years psg rated time, 3 years rated 1st time, and four msms) he taught me how to excell in the army, and that the right thing sometimes means pissing people off  thank you msg s c faulk and congrats  you are the standard"
"after reading about deaths and violence in every corner of the world thanks to my 20 news apps, i can't help but wonder: why is so little effort placed in the development and spread of non lethal arms? why does violence have to end in death and destruction? what if we went to war with only non lethal tools?"
