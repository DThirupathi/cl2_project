back in oneonta   
sometimes i just hate everything about life   it might not be so bad if there was actually anything to do in oneonta

"one second its warm and <propfemale>, the next its pouring rain   oneonta "
sometimes i feel like an angry old man in a young man's body 
back in ossining
we're all trapped on earth and there's no way out   
i'm bored and tired 
back in oneonta again 
"you know its funny, these people go to sleep    they think everything's fine everything's good     they wake up the next day and they're on fire!"
"back in ossining, going on vacation on the 14th, then back to school!"
sometimes just being alive pisses me off

"go away, sore throat "
"even if i found true happiness, i wouldn't know what to do with it "
i should be doing something  there is nothing i to do   
"do you doodle?  do you want to see your doodles on a  big wall with a bunch of other doodles?  let me know, the deadline is creeping up "
