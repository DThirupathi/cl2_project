"if your mom is or was your hero, your best friend, or just the best mom ever, if you are blessed to still have your mom or if she is waiting for you in heaven, paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your mom, and that you love her dearly  you can replace a lot of people in life, but you only have one mom"
"this weather is too cold, too snowy, too winter!"
"brother's week! if you have a brother who has made you laugh, punched you, stuck up for you, drove you crazy, annoyed you to no end, hugged you, watched you succeed, saw you fail, picked you back up, cheered you on, made you strong, and is someone you are very proud to have in your life, tell them  love you, <propfirst>  (aka sparky) "
