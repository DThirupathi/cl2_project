"when some1 tells u 4 so long that ur not beautiful, or u have nothing 2 look @  when some1 tells u 4 so long that ur stupid, ur a bitch, ur this and ur that  when that some1 is some1 who is suppose 2 love u 4 all time, how do u react? what do u do? what do u say?? what do u do when u feel that u want 2 go on with ur life, but they don't?? so many questions, yet no answers, what is the question, & what is the answer??"
here we go again!!!! nother 1 on the way too!!!!
"<propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i can not change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference "

"poetry is in essence just how we feel & act  our thoughts r written down though not always xact  poetry has a deeper meaning than just what is said, to understand poetry you must read betwen the lines to undrstand the meaning hidden  yes i am having some thoughts that mte be coming out, but maybe i can change u+i  change ourselves  don't love you anymore, stopped loving you ages ago  now your just a habit   "

"have u ever wished u could b some1 else? not necesarily another person, but that u had been born in a different state, different time period, different country, different origins? me, i'd like 2 have been born a cherokee maiden, in the state that's now called oklahoma, in the 1800's  i've always admired the cherokee nation, & almost wrote a story about the trail of tears  i still have it thou i've never finished it "
isn't ironic how u go about ur life never really seeing people for who and what they r?? the ones u think r ur friends end up losing touch with u & the ones u haven't seen in 10 15 yrs r the ones who can change ur life  people u've never met can say 1 little thing & it changes ur perspective about life & the way u always thought & lived 
"what do i do and what do i say? the things i feel just won't go away  in one way you tell me you love me, and another way you tell me you want out  you throw ultimatums at me when i am who i have been and will never change  you demand this, you demand that, you want this, and you want that  what about me? i to have my wants, my needs, but you've forgotten those    "
"man what a f$&%ed up day     i woke up in a good mood than i got a phone call that sent my mood straight to hell  had a massive headache for almost the entire day, then spoke to some really great friends & now  well it's ending on a good note again  yeah for me!!!!!!!!"
"what u think u no is never true  what u think is truth is really a lie  do u ever really no anything about ur significant other? does he she ever really tell u whats on their mind? or are they telling what they think u want to hear? life is full of many dirty little secrets  & i believe that behind every door is just another secret  we may not always want to hear the truth, but i do believe the truth will set u free "
"well i finally did it   i got my pics up like every1 has been asking 4 like 6 months now!!!! its just the begining thou so bear with me!!! & to those of u who haven't seen me in awhile yes i colored my hair, and yes im wearing makeup!!! hehe   "

i read something the other day that has stuck with me  it's from proverbs 31 & it reads: a worthy woman   strength and dignity are her clothing and she smiles at the future  just wanted to share that little tidbit  makes u think is there a worthy man????
