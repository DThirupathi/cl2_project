"my horoscope is so true everyday: you are likely to distance yourself from others now, feeling the need to withdraw and reflect  your thoughts are inclined to be heavy, critical, and pessimistic at this time, so it would be good to realize that you are only seeing part of the picture, and perhaps seek the advice of an older, e playful erienced person who has passed through some of the challenges you face "
"i'm totally in this mood:this is not a period when you feel like pushing your own interests forward in which you are especially energetic or full of stamina other people's concerns and needs receive more attention from you now,& you are more inclined to do something which serves others,perhaps a group you are associated with cooperating w  others for some idealistic purpose is very satisfying for you at this time "
