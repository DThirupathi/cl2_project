has 4 kids running around the house   playful   add the two dogs and listen to the insanity  good thing i have coffee   smile 
took connor to his first dentist appointment today  he screamed his head off while kicking and hitting  it was quite interesting  all the dentist did was look at his teeth and said she was done  i thought they cleaned teeth still  maybe next time 
"is blah   i want to go do something fun with the kids because <propmale> is off today, but it's cold and raining   i have no motivation to leave the house "
is annoyed   anja decided to have a party with the garbage all over the house while we were sleeping   what a mess!
"i left <propfemale> out of her cage when i went to the gym this morning, like i do most mornings and she destroyed <propmale> ramsey's book  it wasn't even out, and i was only gone for an hour! so much for a total money makeover  she also ate all of the paperwork from our driveway that we had done in april  i'll never know why she specifically went after those things, i had a perfectly new yellow pages sitting next to them  ugh!"
"i'm watching the news and it's 34 degrees outside with a \feels like\"" of 23! no wonder i'm freezing after my morning run """

"so, i was dreading seeing the dentist today, but tomorrow will be worse  i have to have all four wisdom teeth removed at 9am  the surgeon told me that i won't want to do anything for the next three days besides sleep, and i won't be able to run for the next week or two  the only reason they have to be removed is because my mouth is too small for them  (really, my mouth is too small?)"
"is in insane amounts of pain  the surgeon had a hard time getting the teeth out, said that he doubts i'll ever have osteoporosis because how incredibly dense my teeth are  he ended up leaving some roots in because he just couldn't get it out  i will possibly have some nerve damage, he saw touched the nerve & said that it may leave my jaw numb  he hopes that if i have nerve damage that it will be better eventually "
"just saw the dentist because of awful pain& a crooked mouth that i couldn't open wide enough for a toothbrush  he said that i'm healing recovering faster than he e playful ected  the pins&needles that i feel where the nerve damage was done is good, that means the nerve is fixing it's self  he told me to find some hard, stale bazooka bubble gum&chew on it to get my jaw working again  that's good news, i guess "
"happy thanksgiving everyone! i'm thankful for many of the usual things: family, friends, house, situation in life, my dogs, and plenty more  i'm especially thankful for the newest development in my life         my mouth doesn't hurt at the moment! i still have numbness, but i don't have awful pain   laugh "

any police couples out there want to go on a date night next saturday night: to go shooting and out for pizza? shielded hearts has organized the evening and there are a few spots left 
"things i have learned tonight   don't cross your fingers while shooting a gun, <propfemale> forward, ear protection is important, don't point down when pulling the trigger, gun powder and shooting can start a fire, lasers on guns are nice, gun powder makes hands feel dirty, and most importantly casings are very hot when they land in one's cleavage, cover up the puppies so they don't get a bullet shaped burn "
"even though i can't see it, even though i don't always understand it   i will walk by faith and give thanks in all circumstances   this is god's will and not my own "
