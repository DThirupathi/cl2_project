"when i breathe my last few breathes of life, will you be there? when my last sight is determined, will i be seeing you? if only you knew how much you mean to me  if only you felt the same  somehow, your words don't hold the pain mine do, the fear or the joy  its as if you were a doll  just sitting there with that damn smile  but in the end, you will never know "
"when you feel like your gonna break into pieces because of a dream, thats when you need to wake up and cry or its gonna haunt you forever  i did that today, i felt the pain rising but not the happiness  seeing him walk away was the hardest dream i've had  maybe i should let go? that's what i've been thinking   but i just dont want to  i've waited and waited, now i love him too much "

too much drama  i think my head might e playful lode  lol bright side? i get to see him all weekend appearantly  smile  yes! movie marathon  i want my <propfemale> to come toooo     sad  she cant though
"you gotta love the fact that when you get your hopes up, you break down when they are destroyed  tears come and go  same as boyfriends  their never forever like they tell us all the time  never say forever to me   because your a liar once those words reach my ears  it wont last as long as i thought it would  we wont have time for it to last  i'm sorry    i wish it was different "
"we got to pretend we were on a slave ship in world civ  it was interesting imagining the horrid smells, feels and ways of that ship \but honestly, you gotta feel some pride for those who did manage to live through it all  they were strong spirited "
when your heart is completely ripped out of your chest with your own strenght    somethings wrong  when you feel so sick to your stomach your about to pass out before you even wake fully up  somethings really wrong  these are the signs of a heartache  something i hate so badly and something that makes me hate myself even more   annoyed 
when you cant think or talk of that person without crying    you truly are head over heels  when you see that person in the hall and so much pain hits you all at once but then you remember that its over    you just stand there and force tears back  because your stronger then you were before  you will get through it all  with a fake or real smile 
"it kinda makes me irratated how guys in trigg, if you break up, they just keep going  like you never existed  it gets under my skin  but guys in clarksville are amazing  smile  i can't wait to be in clarksville  new beginning  but i'll come back to trigg    sometimes"

" laugh  listening to sexyback  my dog is actually howling to the song   smile  \when your life is as crazy as mine, thats when you should go get your head checked lol \\ima be at hamfest! ohhhhh yea!"
"its funny when you look at your cat laying down in front of you, then look down at the computer  five minutes look back up at the cat and the new puppy is trying to <propfemale> it around like a toy   surprise  that poor cat "
when you dont know your relationship with the guy you like  thats when you need to put your foot down and figure it out quick  or your gonna get hurt 
when you tell yourself you wont miss any of it  then you compare it to your current home and area  you start to wonder if it all even mattered  if all those 2-3 years in trigg were really worth while  the guys you date dont matter in the long run  the people you befriend end up hating you over bullshit drama that they started themselves and the world you came to know shatters with a light touch of his hand  help
