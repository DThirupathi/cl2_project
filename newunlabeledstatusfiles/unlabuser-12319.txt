"live as godâ€™s obedient children  donâ€™t slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires  you didnâ€™t know any better then (1 <propfirst> 1:14)  so many times in this life, we are tempted by this world   but we must stand strong against satan, and not let him take back control of our lives   living by our own desires instead of godâ€™s will for us, will only lead to destruction "
"got some baking to get done for tonight, it's going to be awesome!!"
"watch out for false prophets  they come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves  by their fruit you will recognize them  do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?(matt 7:15-16) so many times weâ€™re reminded of this in the new testament, and yet there are still so many out there  beware of their false teachings and man made ideas because they are not of jesus "
"the bible tells us that god is love, and as surly as he loves all of you, so do i  iâ€™ve always had a great compassion for other peoples lives, showing them the great love that we share with our lord jesus christ  true love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance "

"a beaming sunrise buries the night  the setting sun destroys the light  then she says, baby, iâ€™ve gotta get going  cutting each other without even knowing  she sees a million stars like holes in the sky  all godâ€™s tears for her, they cry and i am in her rain "
"then jesus told them â€œthis is my commandment: love each other in the same way i have loved you  there is no greater love than to lay down oneâ€™s life for oneâ€™s friends â€� (<propfirst> 15:12-13) coming this sunday, witness the <propfemale> of godâ€™s one and only son  in the whip, the hammer and the cross  learn the true meaning of the crucifixion, and everything jesus went through, all because of his great love for you "
who wants to go the good friday service tonight at new life assembly with me?  it starts a 7
"everything jesus did was very purposeful  he embraced and loved the cross because of what it meant  he suffered all the torture that came with it, willingly  everyone e playful ected something different to happen? why did he not call a legion of angels to save himself? with god donâ€™t get disappointed when things donâ€™t work    out the way you think they should, there is a resurrection coming!!! jesus something different!"
"easterâ€™s all about the resurrection of christ, freeing us of all our sins  2 corinthians 5:21 says â€œgod made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of god â€� man how cool is that, tomorrow is going to be awesome!!! praise god, the lord almighty!!"
"welcome victory day!! we wait quietly before god, for our victory comes from him  today we celebrate the resurrection of christ  he died so that the sin of the world may be lifted up, and set us free  he left us with a giftâ€”peace of mind and heart  and the peace he gave us is a gift the world cannot give  our hearts ache, but we always have joy  we own nothing, and yet we have everything! thank you jesus!!"

"if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path  and be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself  share in each otherâ€™s burdens  if you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself  you are not that important (galatians 6:1-3)"
we know what real love is because jesus gave up his life for us  so we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters  if someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows no compassionâ€”how can godâ€™s love be in that person?
"while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens us  many christians out there read their bibles without spending anytime in the word  because of this they think theyâ€™re better than everyone else, because their heads are full of knowledge, but their hearts are empty  how can you have faith, if you donâ€™t have love  if they would only stop and listen to the word of god, putting it into their hearts "
is super excited about being the newest member on our youth leadership team  just another way the lord has blessed me; the ability of reaching others and touching lives 
"then jesus said â€œcome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and i will give you rest  take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for i am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls  for my yoke is easy and my burden is light \ (<propfirst> 11:28-30)"""
"looking out from his throne, the father of light and of men  chose to make himself known and show us the way back to him  speaking wisdom and truth into the hearts of peasants and kings  he began to unveil the word that would change the course of all things  the word is alive and it cuts like a sword through the darkness  with a message of life to the hopeless and afraid  breathing life into all who believe "
what this world needs is not another one hit wonder with an axe to grind another two bit politician peddling lies another three ring circus society what this world needs is not another sign waving super saint that's better than you  another prophet in an armani suit what this world needs is a savior who will rescue a spirit who will lead a father who will love them in their time of need that's what this world needs

"this morning at breakfast we were discussing a little passage from <propmale> 13 smile 1-33  in it, the pharisees tell jesus to â€œget away from here if you want to live! harod antipas wants to kill you!â€� in response jesus answered â€œgo tell that fox that i will keep on casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and the third day, i will accomplish my purpose â€�"
"have <propfemale> in all you do, for in time all will be revealed  you may be on a <propmale> road in your life  but those willing to wait, will find the smooth pavement that lies ahead  god blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation  afterwards they will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him  have faith in god, and everything will turn out as it should, according to his will "

"president obama has decided that there will no longer be a \national day of prayer\"" held in may  he doesn't want to offend anybody  where was his concern about offending christians last january when he allowed the muslims to hold a day of prayer on the capitol grounds  as a christian american \""i am offended \"" if you agree copy and paste no matter what religion you are"""
"jesus is the most normal christian there is  jesus is the example, not the exception  all the wonderful things he did back then, people say canâ€™t be done today  but i say if we just have faith in god, we can do them all  jesus tells us in <propfirst> 14:12 â€œi tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works i have done, and even greater ones â€�"
"there is pain and sorrow everywhere! running away from your problems solves nothing, without faith, youâ€™ll be heading into the unknown, where youâ€™ll feel all alone and scared  so rejoice in our confident hope in god  and instead of running away from your troubles, try turning towards god, for he loves you so very much  holding you tightly when things get rough "
"no matter how bad things get, you shouldnâ€™t run away from the situation  this solves nothing! instead be patient in trouble and keep on praying, for the lord is always there  he hears our prayers, and comes to the rescue every time  he is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble "

"lord, give you unfailing love, the salvation that he promised you  then youâ€™ll be able to answer those who taunt you, for you trust in his word (psalm 119:41:42) jesus says in <propfirst> 14:1 â€œdonâ€™t let your hearts be troubled  trust in god, and trust also in me â€� and in <propmale> 7:9 the lord tells us â€œunless your faith is firm, i cannot make you stand firm â€� so just <propfemale> in there!!"
"people need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness, so there is no cure & it's not contagious  they only want what we all want, to be accepted  most of you probably won't copy and paste this  will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour? it's special education week   and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding"
"the purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith but some people have missed this whole point they have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions they want to be known as teachers of the law of <propmale>, but they donâ€™t know what they are talking about, even though they speak so confidently"

"â€œphysical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come â€� this is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it  it is why we work hard and continue to struggle, for our hope is in the living god, who is the savior of all people and particularly of all believers  (1 <propfirst> 4:8-10)"
"never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him respectfully as you would to your own father  talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers  treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters  (1 <propfirst> 5:1-2)"

"everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure  but nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences are corrupted  such people claim they know god, but they deny him by the way they live  they are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good  (<propmale> 1:15-16)"

"now we see things imperfectly as in a cloudy mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity  all that i know now is partial and incomplete, but then i will know everything completely, just as god now knows me completely  1 corinthians 13:12"
there is nothing that our god cannot do  he will do everything if you dare to believe 
"consider it a sheer gift, friends, when tests and challenges come at you from all sides  you know that under pressure, your faith is forced into the open and shows its true colors  so donâ€™t try to get out of anything prematurely  let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way  (the message, <propfirst> 1:2-4)"
