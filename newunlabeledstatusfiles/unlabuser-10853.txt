sitting at drill ready to go home
"its not what im thinking that really matters that much, its what im feeling that effect my thinking that matters the most"
being bored sitting in class hoping mr  <propfirst> reads this and gets on to me for using facebook in school cause i have a couple of things to say to that guy      
its easier to denounce the evil doer than it is to understand him      
"on a road trip having fun, i hope we don't have car trouble"
"what's in your head can sometimes drive you crazy, but what's in your heart will always drive you crazy   \                                     <propmale> turner"
why is the world so good to me right now? but before why was it so bad to me? why will it be bad to me again? and why will it be good to me again? i wish
it would just stay good to me till the day i die
headed on a overnight fishing trip with my girlfriends dad
"today is my last day home for awhile, fixing to ship off to ait, goodbye all my friends ill see you when i get back"
"headed to camp robinson in little rock, arkansas"
in ait at fort sill missing home already and but loving the military food
"sitting at ait being bored missing home, wondering when the porch swing falls from weak supports do you put it back up or do you let it stay down"
"i'm tired of being in this place, it is really starting to mess with my head and everything back home is changing and i can't do a single thing about it"
just woke up realizing i feel asleep talking to <propfemale> on the phone
"been waiting on a cab for two hours, finally got one and now i'm headed to a <propfirst> <propfirst> concert"
"my phone has been shut off but for some reason i can still receive facebook messages and reply to them, how weird, i miss <propfemale> so much  sad "
"people who i thought were friends are going crazy and accusing me of things that i would never do, what is this world coming to when people cant even trust their own friends or when friends make stuff up because they need some serious mental therapy?"
thanks to everyone that wished me happy birthday the other day!!!!!!!!!!
happy veterians day everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"need a good job, anyone know of one?"
