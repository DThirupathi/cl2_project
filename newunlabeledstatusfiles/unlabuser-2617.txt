"thought i'd check in before checking out for the night, especially since i'm off tomorrow   not that i don't relish my monday work schedule, cause i do   but a break from the norm is a break just the same   and shakin things up a little bit never hurts!  "

"getting ready for long day, closing opening   but there's pool to look forward to!  sorry for the error with the iheart app, why don't we all pretend it's our birthday!"
"it's pool night  yay!  playing on local turf, just a bus ride away   peace out!"

"gets to sleep in, that must make it quiz night!"
"okay, had enough already   peace out "
"gotta go, peace out!"
"it's my day off and i have a cold   it's the type of cold that's easier to work with than be at home with   miserable, needless to say "
my mind is blank  that's all   just blank!
good one sis!  and yet i'm still dazed and confused!  so i'm off to the one place i think most clearly   at the diner til further notice   
"is looking forward to a day off tomorrow, i get to sleep in, yay!"
"thanks for all the birthday wishes!  yes i am celebrating, but i still refuse to open the mail from aarp!  getting ready to grab my cue and run   already got lei'd by <propfirst>, what else do i need?  my mini-me is strapped to the post at the diner so that i can't fall over, i'm good to go!"
"happy birthday <propfemale>   i'm still glad you're older and i still refuse to open the aarp mail!  got your card, thank-you, <propfirst> thinks you sound like mom (it's the accent)  enjoy your day!  love you!"

"once again, still up   good thing i'm off tomorrow today!  not caring to play in my own sandbox anymore, wanna play in someone else's sandbox   yet it seems to be so far away, and then again, maybe not   too conflicted to make it quiz night   slow but steady wins the race, right?!"
"my prayers are for avi <propmale> <propfemale>, who really needs them right now!"
"it's been a quiet day off, guess i needed that   my sandbox needs fresh sand and imma gonna get it!"
"finally has a date to get fresh sand, and yes i'm headed south!"

guess it was quiz night   i'm done for now   
i just wanna know how come i've got almost all my family here and my niece that deleted me is the only one to call me to let me know that my sister is in the hospital and not doing well   what is up with that?  are you guys there   or what??
how come it seems that even though family should be sacred   no matter what   it doesn't quite seem that way?
i'm very disappointed   in all my family   i am!
"okay, an update for my uninformed family   dawn is not doing well   her heartbeat is finally coming down from the 151 that it was at   her sugar still isn't good   the blood coming from the tube isn't coming from her lungs   or she'd be dead   they're still not sure where it's coming from   she's not coherent, but <propfemale> thinks she saw head movement   and yes, <propmale> is not there but <propfirst> is"
<propfemale> is still critical   she is holding her own at the moment   the bleeding has stopped and they're bringing her sugar down as gradual as possible   her ammonia and acid levels are still really high (like off the charts) and they're trying to understand why   she's not in a coma but comatose   there is body movement but no acknowledgement   my sister <propfemale> is there which can only help her   we're still praying!
<propfemale> convinced mom to break the rules so that she could talk to me   she was quite coherent and assured me that she's not giving up the fight   they let her have a little ice cream and her diet coke and then she ate some dinner   they've removed all restraints and with assistance is going to the bathroom   yay!  the power of prayer!  i love her and i love you all!  love 
talked to mom   they're looking for a bed downstairs to move her to   she's content to stay til they let her go   brenda fixed her hair for her and she looks much better   she's eating and taking herself to the bathroom   you can call her directly: 703-664-8602 and please do!  love 
gone fishing   yay!
