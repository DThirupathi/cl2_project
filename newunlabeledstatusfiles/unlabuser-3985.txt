"â€œit is as true now as it was then that no matter what tests show, very little of what is taught in school is learned, very little of what is learned is remembered, and very little of what is remembered is used  the things we learn, remember, and use are the things we seek out or meet in the daily, serious, nonschool parts of our lives â€� ~john holt -author of how children fail"
