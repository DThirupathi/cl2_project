"i can't stop this road i'm on, i guess i just have to keep going until the road runs out  then pick up the pieces "
"i'm not all sweet sugar and <propfemale> people make me out to be, i will surprise you  i will never be the \easy\"" girl you want me to be """
"everyone's a version of themselves depending on their surrounding company  so let me be the first to ask, who are you?"
missing something  sad 
still getting hell for not being what they want 
it's been exactly four months  ;>
had the best time at zombie prom! can't wait to do it again with my girls 
i never could decide whether i was a purple parrot or a silver snake   
it's never too early to drink a beer  ;>
isn't it time to run away???
i'm in for an e playful erience tonight  something tells me this could be epic  ;>
"getting ready for <propfemale>'s party  {wondering where all those badfish are   } >,<"
"i'm in recovery mode  tired, not feeling good, just waiting for him to come make it all better "
"you can't put all your faith into forever, just follow your heart and trust in yourself "
"had terrible dreams   marriage and debauchery, and so much else  glad i'm awake now "
"tomorrow i'm 19, things should feel better "
"to everyone who gave me a fantastic 19th: thank you, it was definitely one of my best! ;>"
"for some reason, i'm on edge like a mother!"
i feel rather wrong right now  like i'm being screamed at from all angles  i can't stand it  i can't bring myself to do all those little things i need to  what's wrong with me??
"i'm so excited to get away a little this spring break  lately, i haven't been myself "
i can't stop this feeling or these trains of thought  i need to pull myself out of this 
"you: are jealous because, i: am going to the river "
i hate what i am going through  i loathe remembering  i despise what you have done 
"can't seem to get rid of thia feeling, can't seem to be myself again  i don't know what to do when there is no one to reach out to who is going to really be the one to help "
"they blazed a trail i dared to run  but i need another, and i can feel this soul is bleeding "
i want to remember to remember to forget that you forgot me 
"   what a rush, a reminisce, cold crush "
"you see inside, you see love, you see one in a million  <<that's the sweetest thing anyone has ever told me, thank you <propfemale> "
"i don't know why there are people who pretend to be in your life for you, but really it's only whenever they want to be "
just want to hear that special something   
i need some change  i need a little variation in my life  excite me?
"same old symptoms, does this make me addicted?"
not sure what my state of mind is anymore   
"lucky i can take care of myself, can't always depend on everyone else "
"if i could coddle the infection, they could amputate at once "
this amount of frustration is what causes problems 
you'll never guess the proposition i got today   really makes me think  o o
"deep in quicksand, dive in the shallow end, break my neck, now i'm never getting up again "
it'll be a miracle if i survive without the scars of destruction 
"my mind seems a lot calmer today, i hope this is a new phase "
this is a rather destructive new <propfemale> 
this is an <propfemale> for me  i will be selfish in my descovery of self  the time is mine to live  finally 
"got a secret, can you keep it, swear this one you'll save? better lock it in your pocket, taking this one to the grave "
"these thoughts have me in a stupor, can't believe these thoughts could be my own  but you know, this is me and i'm facing that and realizing that maybe change is necessary  i have some truths to spill in time, are you ready?    am i??"
"flick on, flick off my switch  i don't e playful ect to feel regret for this "
"feeling anti-social as of now, we shall see   "
"i'm pretty sure i hit a wall  a big, brick fucking wall "
"shivering and shaking, feeling all around terrible  i feel unsatisfied "
"not only am i sick, my dog is missing  not only is my dog missing, i am falling down down down an emotional hell hole  i hate that he doesn't seem to care, i hate that no one seems to care  i hate that i just made myself sicker by going out in the rain to look for my dog  i hate that i will never forgive myself if he doesn't come back, or if he isn't found  i hate hating, but i am emotionally out of control "
"i have to find a way to make it to the <propfirst> reggae fest, any ideas?"
my mommy passed away une playful ectedly this morning    this is what it means to be truly heartbroken 
i'm going to run so far that no one will find me  i'm going to run so far that i'm going to find her  i'm going to run 
thank you to everyone who has been there for me through this  it does make a difference 
someone needs to let me rant at them  someone needs to here my ramblings  someone needs to hold me back because i am so close from going over 
my family is falling apart and everyone has their opinions of me  want to see them come true?
"i want you to know that there is so much you don't know  and every day that passes with me withholding myself, i ache a little more  but truth's can't be spilt because i have to be the glue that holds things together "
when life is hard you have to change 
wherever the fuck i want   
i've come to the realization that i am no longer grieving or coping  i have turned it all off to be the strong one  so   where does that leave me i wonder   
"gonna throw down tonight, time to put em up!"
"there is this knot of doom growing by the second in my gut  i am going to the beach with my family in honor of my mommy, i hope this goes away and i find some peace  i can't handle people pushing me right now, i'm e playful loding already "
"i was actually able to be happy for a few hours, until people brought my world crashing down even harder than before  worst part is, i let them  this is the longest anxiety attack i have ever e playful erienced  i'm really actually very scared "
"three hours of sleep in two days and all i can ask myself is, \how's your heart lately?\"""""
how much more will it have to hurt before i find my peace?
what if i'm just one of those stars that burn out too fast?
"i'm torn between people telling me i have to graduate, and people telling me that i can't  well, let me show you assholes what i can do  and then let's see if you can catch me once i run away from this life "
"this feeling in my stomach must be unfufilment, unhappiness, and general frustration "
"everytime i think i can breathe again and that i'm not about to lose my mind, something sends me right back to that place  i want to shed this life like an old skin, find a whole new way "
"i've been blank lately, absolutely blank "
"if you can destroy me faster than i can destroy myself, i invite you to try  i'll even award a prize "
"and i'm breaking down and i want to share my secrets and you couldn't care at all  keep shutting me out, i will tolerate it for only so long "
"my mother, my mother, she held me when i was out there   "
"through every <propmale> above the trees, within my stomach scraped off my knees, i drink the <propfemale> inside this hive, you are the reason i stay alive "
"now watch what you say because they'll be calling you a radical, liberal  oh fanatical, criminal  oh, won't you sign up your name? we'd like to feel you're respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable "
i'm on this non stop roll (decent?) into   insanity?
no rest for the wicked 
"shaking, mistaking, forsaken, it's killing me  wishing i could change, but i've always been this way  if you leave now, will i drown?"
i want to know why there always has to be this disconnect between me and the world 
"can i get better on my own or will i just get worse? i've survived by myself before, but do i have it in me to do it again?"
"there's something coming, you can feel it in the ground  it's rising like a stain in our unsespecting minds "
"alright, well it seems i'm always going to be playing someone's game  push me  push me  push me "
nothing is sacred anymore  nothing is special  worth is non existent when you are talking about me 
"i can hear you in a whisper, but you can't even hear me screaming "
"i wanna run away from this awful place in my mind, i don't wanna do no more time  i'm burning up, from this fire in my soul, i'm burning up   "
"every day feels like the last, and nothing changes in the way this feels "
finding myself in another breakdown  knees to the floor and a whole lot of heartbreak 
i am not here  i'm not listening  i am in my head and i'm spinning 
"i feel like i am losing touch with people  call me, text, miss you all   "
"there is a feeling of insanity and a feeling like okay  in between the feelings, thoughts, mental breaks, and stints of numb blankness, there is the lonely and dull ache there is constant confusion  it gets worse before it gets better and im scared to see what my worse is  i can embrace this decent with open arms but sometimes i want to fight it like all hell "
"i'm a graduate now! walked across the stage, things are starting to look up some "
"i have a job interview in an hour, wish me luck!    but it's for a sirver position, i don't know if i want to waitress  oh well, i'll see how everything goes  good choices, right??"
it's hard trying to stay positive; who knew motivation was such work?!
sometimes i feel so out of place in my own life  i'm tired of being pacified and reassured only to be left alone again to the horrrors that can be my mind 
time to go preach to the choir 
i don't think i got the job   sad 
fuck 'em 
"i didn't know it could feel like this  i didn't know, but everyone warned me  yes they did "
i'm nice and sunkissed now  ;>
my heart is desperately trying to escape my chest 
we're like sugar gliders!!!
"last night was one of the best, craziest nights ever!!! tonight will be good too  ;>"
"i think maybe it all is worthwhile   by the way, <propfemale> streep is amazing, i think i could idolize her  ; )"
i'll pay when tomorrow comes today 
start by starting 
to forget ourselve - and pretend all is well  there is no hell 
it ain't ever going to feel this good <propfemale>  ;>
i am finding you are like protection; when did you become my safety?
here i am depression; i'm dancing through your gardens of heaven and hell 
it won't be long now    everyhing is so close to changing  i am so close to the edge  a new war has begun  new lines are being drawn  and i still don't know which way to go 
a new leaf? or just an aultered one?
"i am a strong, independent woman  i need to learn to love myself alone and not depend on the love of others "
"apparently, i am not being sensible "
"i am in a state of hedonism  i have found that a sort of hysterical calmness has come over me  oh, and he left me today "
"i just declared my new singularity  it doesn't feel real though, and i don't know what i feel about it "
i never knew it could hurt like this    i never thought you'd break my heart 
"i am not ready to consider my options, i want to stay in this place for a while  i don't want to have to do anything but be "
"when you hate it, you know you can feel "
"i just can't stop crossing lines, can i? i won't stop, will i?"
"and by the way, by the way, don't say i didn't warn you that i'd always stay the same "
i'm trembling from the inside out  this can't be good 
"there is nothing like a kindred spirit to make me smile and appreciate life, if only for a little while   wink "
"when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never  because when you dance with the devil, the dance may last forever "
"try and shrug it off, shrug it off, shrug it off  well, it's only skin  now you need to understand there is nothing fake about this  do i need to let you in?"
"as to why most of you have been neglected: i have had a split from reality, gone through a period of psychosis, broken most of my rules, and now i am looking at all the little broken pieces of myself strewn everywhere  once i figure out how to put myself back together, and how to leave the house, i will be back to the <propmale> you all know  my mom's memorial service is this saturday, for anyone interested "
"the monster is clawing at my door, it wants in  and i want to let it in, relent  i can't open that door again  not too far  wait, not at all?"
"i know that i'll have regrets, but that's the price of one more lesson learned "
"someone just opened my eyes: i've been running my whole life, but i don't know from what "
sunday night: terrible fuckin' idea 
aries are an entirely diffferent entity of beings designed to e playful ressly fuck up my world 
"you can call this, the begining of the loss of control "
road trippin with my two favorite allies! the beach calls the fish and the fungus is among us to boot!
i'll tumble for ya   
my skies are falling  
"i'm not claiming i have no blame in this love of a mess, but i am claiming that you have more "
"once i had the one, the love that i thought would never be  now it all falls apart one by one  i watch my walls crumble, i see my city fall, i feel it all  where is there to go now?"
"long story short: i broke my phone and now have a new one  but when i broke it i broke it beyond redemption so my contacts could not be recovered  so please send me your cell digits, etc "
i hate when you realize that you have forged a connection with something fleeting 
"i mean it, i really did lose all of my <propfirst>, please send them to me  lol "
if you talk to much my head will e playful lode 
"so when things go wrong cheat, lie, and make a fellow human being feel like shit  that's what every one else is doing   "
evry date night ends up   not being our date night  we shall see 
it's all rock n' roll until bridges begin to burn 
"pull me    pull me on out of this tree, i'm stuck up a branch waiting  clearly caught between two things unclear, to me   "
"i can say the most epic things  damn, people need to listen to me more often! i will enlighten you  lol    {but really }"
"disgusted, sick to my stomach, and my skin is crawling  lucky i don't know where i stand in the eye for an eye debacle "
aren't you high enough?
waking up is knowing who you really are  i've been sleeping so long now   
and it all came tumbling after   
"'cause you make me feel like a dog, you can see my emotion  is this for real? i'm a girl sinking deep in the ocean "
maybe i am making some more big mistakes   
it's that magic combination that let's me breath again  it's my own 11:11 when my sight goes red  it's my little haven when you don't answer  it's my salvation from it all 
"it\comes crashing down before you can even tell anything is wrong  and\when your heart is surprised like that, well does it ever fully recover?"
my heart is breaking and no one is to blame but me 
"i can love ferociously, be wounded easily, and be wrong when i am not  i can be right when i am wrong, i can be misguided, i am human  but i love  i love even when my love isn't recognized for what it is "
dealing with constant on and off migraines and a sickening feeling in my gut  life  is this it?
"with each day that passes by i pray to god that i will never forget who you were to me, and what you meant  i love you, and loved you even when i thought i didn't  i feel your spirit inside of me and i know you watch over me  i will see you in another place, some day  i'm not going to let you down mommy "
"i to want take my head and cut it open extra wide  want to examine all the thoughts that seem to cricle inside  electrocute my thoughts or put my self on stand by  i'm so over, i'm so over   "
"he loves the muted version of me, not me as i am "
"when you almost hit bottom you never forget the feeling  you never forget the sour taste in your mouth and the dead look in your eyes  you change, everything alters, and bits and pieces remain even as you claw your way back  and when people look close enough, sometimes they can see it too "
"hey you, miss  blue    getting those feelings again  man i need a little escape  need to run away just a little, maybe just for a day  just need the things i used to have  miss the people "
"i have things to say, and people are beginning to listen    maybe they were all along "
more and more my friends build me up  you've given me what i need to find my voice 
"here all your walls surround me, they're closin' in, they blocked my sight  the violence around me found me when i could not fight  {you push from the inside   you push from the inside out   }"
i crave catharsis and i have been nailed to the cross long enough  i don't owe anything anymore  i set myself free 
inhale  deeply  hold  exhale  repeat 
"this has been a trying week  trying, but not so bad  progress? i am thinking so! ;>"
i feel so disconnected from what i am connected to 
"i am facing myself with honesty, and i will eventually face it all head on  i have truths to speak  and you will listen  do you know your own truths?"
"i'm sorry i didn't make it out tonight, a lot of bullshit was going down  i am okay, no worries  just stressed and have a lot on my mind  i am really sorry i missed your birthday nessa, i promise to make it up to you  everyone else who was there, i'm sorry too "
where is your will to be weird?
sometimes all i really want to feel is love  sometimes i'm angry that i feel so angry  sometimes my feeelings get in the way of what i really feel i needed to say 
she wasn't happy  she isn't happy  she doesn't know how to be happy anymore 
let the children lose it  let the children use it  let all the children buggie 
who needs reality when i can paint the finest of delusions!
"i'm gunna take up disc golf, presenting <propfemale> and i as: tee-bird and the banshee!"
"i don't want to grow up, bring me all the toys you can find  you don't want to grow up, you can be my partner in crime "
"i'm swinging like a whistler monkey from my broken chandalier, nibbling on glass so you all can k*ss my ackabakamysodakrackamygtomybootyhole!!!!!!!!!"
"having my quality time with my <propfemale> cat  we can talk for hours and never get close to finishing, i never run out of things to say to her  i continue to bear my soul and everything i am to her  this is feeling at peace "
i am bored by the chore of saving face and if it is your disgrace i must now embrace then so be it!
i just can't focus on anything   
how very special are we? for just a moment to be part of lifeâ€™s eternal rhyme  how very special are we? to have on our family tree mother earth and father time 
"well, i got through my mommy's funeral in one piece somehow  thank you all who were there in rememberance of my mommy and also for my support  i love you all "
my feelings are playing hide and seek  i'm questioning whether or not this is healing   
the steady change of the clock keeps my mind locked as the chains of thought keep me here 
"i came as call\\i came as flat\\i came too soon so i came back\\i came as flowers\\i came as nice\\i came as dirt and i came as it's price\\it takes a long time but god dies too\\but not before he'll stick it to you\\i don't know but i been told you never die and you never grow old"
"it's just that lately i like blanking out, i'm falling into all of the things we aren't allowed to say  so baby girl just shake it off, there is still so much time to play "
"you can't change where you've been, i need to learn to own up to it and embrace it  i think i am getting there, a little regression, but i'll be there one day "
"so as you push of from the shore\wonÂ´t you turn your head once more\and make your peace with evÂ´ryone\for those who choose to stay\will live just one more day\to do the things they should have done\\and as you cross the wilderness\a'spinning in your emptiness you feel you have to pray\looking for a sign that the universal mind\has written you into the passion play"
had the best halloween night at the bonham yesterday with my people  ;> thanks and love to all 
reading the lost symbol by <propfirst> brown and trying to forget to think 
"i'll always remember you like a child, girl "
"runnin' in the shadows, chasing that element that seals my chain "
"you are on my mind so steadily, as those particular phonics touch and caress my memory "
"i feel so clear today  the pieces to my recovery are seeming to fall into place without provocation and i am seeming to fall into place with them  one step forward from here on out, backtracking no longer holds that special appeal "
"she's just that forever love that can't leave, and neither can i "
i feel like i was laid out and splayed open  i feel oh so responsible because i promised to never let you down 
happy birthday archer!
"i am so completely sore from last night, i feel like i need a week to recuperate  but at the same time the night was totally worth it  couldn't pass up giving archer's cynical ass a good birthday "
happy birthday to my sissy! going to give her a good night! ;>
i really want to say   i think i've had enough  
scars will heal soon; the dregs in us spent the earth down 
"sad eyes like sharpened daggers, you'll never walk only stagger  sad eyes, quite cryptic  bye "
"by now i should have somehow realized what i'm not to do  but maybe i was going to be the one to save you, and i was supposed to  but even though you once called me your wonderwall, i didn't listen  now who's paying the price?"
if i could turn the <propfemale> in time than i'd rearrange just a day or two  close my eyes  close my eyes  close my eyes 
"in your words, oh, truths that hurt \barge your way back to heavens door "
"<propfemale> christmas to all of my near and dear loved ones  i have just finished filling the stockings, and i can't wait to see smiles!  annoyed  i love you all "
"still recovering from the holidays, not to mention the previous few days of trying to recover from them  tired  unfulfilled  unhappy "
"just when i think, i've got you in safe keeping\thatâ€™s when your memory, it comes round creepin'\well it's an ache i can't shake\it's creeped down deep down to my core\but babe i can't fake it, i can't take this heartbreak\anymoreâ€¦ "
just what i saw in my old dreams were the reflections of my warped mind staring back at me   
"how do i feel for thee? your smile brings disease  'cause we're young, fell in from the stars   "
"i've been giving all i've got  i've been putting up a fight  i've been giving everything, but i ain't got you "
i live  as me  i die 
help! i'm alive  and my heart keeps beeting like a hammer   
being strong 
i'm gunna be gone with the wind once this all hits an end   
and just like that  she was gone  
"if i consider all of these days lost, then what days do i have? this, whatever it is, means something "
"i'm content  ;> thank you <propmale>, <propfemale>, and <propfirst>; i love you  you crazy f***s save my life "
"i'm stressed out, and this is a fucking life trial for sure, but i'm alive  i am alive and thankful and i have hope "
"it's been forever sense i updated this   i miss you all! and thank you for everyone who has been there for me in one way on another, i really do genuinely appreciate all of you "
i've shot away my gun shot hopes   
people that are over the bounds of sanity have it easier in the sense that they don't have to make a choice  making choices haunts me and the tolls they bring are a personal debt 
"they say be afraid, she's not like the others, futuristic or other  different dna, they don't understand you  she's from a whole other world, a different dimension  she'll open your eyes, be ready to go, she'll lead you into the light "
