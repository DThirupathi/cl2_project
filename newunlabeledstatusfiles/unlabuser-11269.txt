"i'm really hungry, but too lazy to fix anything  oh well i guess "
"i should be cleaning the kitchen, but instead i'm sitting at my computer doing nothin"
wishing something good was on tv late at night  -cartoons again-
up and down all night tonight   wish i wasn't so exhausted i was afraid of missing my alarm 
"loving life again after a year  yay, <propfemale> is great!"
looking forward to seeing a movie with <propfemale> tomorrow  yay life really is back to normal 
wondering whether or not i want to attempt to round house kick for jen   and craving going to see another movie 
"i know i should go to bed now, but i don't want to at the same time  going to anyway  tomorrow the real fun begins! only 6 hours to wait "
"sad that this is my last night to visit my bestie, back to the real world tomorrow, plus a super long drive "
lazy day today  tomorrow i clean the kitchen!! if i keep telling myself that maybe i'll actually do it 
feeling out of sorts   just watched the new episode of warehouse 13  now i think i'll read a book and zone 
i'm hanging with jeannette   lord what torture  -shoots self in the foot- no the pain of being with her is worse  jk jk   i'm having a great time 
trying to decide if i want to go out or not   i don't think i will 
finally able to log in again! how happy!
imagines the way i feel now is like the air being let out of a balloon when it gets poped  going to go to work now   hopefully somethg good and or interesting happens along the way  i could really a pep boost or a good laugh right now  -sigh-
going to go to bed now   many errands tomorrow

wishing inspiration wwould just find me   i feel stupid today
i slept way too long yesterday  now i'm wired at 2 am  i hate messing up my sleep schedule
"considering signing up for the 30 dollar writers workshop, but i really don't know that i can spare the money right now "
i have learned my lesson fron now i will fully read all polcy agreements before i sign up  hidden fees just blow 
sitting in biology right now we are making fun of the athrax scare  good times 
i'm blonde again that means i'm allowed to be stupid  hahahaha!
"wishing that money and time difference didn't matter, and could go wherever whenever "
pretty happy  the sword of truth season two is only 2 5 weeks away 
i hate construction  i miss taking naps  they are making me actually wish for winter so they'd go away!
can't believe it's time to schedule for new classes already 
"saw paranormal activity   it wasn't bad, but it was boring "
"going to write a tragic song about my life and sell it to the highest bidder  i've got some pretty intense feelings right now   i think the finished product will be a master piece  it's going to be titled \looking for a lost happiness\"""""
not going to do anything the rest of the night 
"i had to pay 160 dollars, because i had to get my car towed and all because ou has a swine flu breakout on campus  they had to disinfect my car before they would tow it, and then the charged me for the extra \work\""  is it my fault the swine flu got to ou?"""
sitting at sips goofing around  today has been a good day so far
"tomorrow is mom's cleansing ceremony  i'm happy for her, but i sure don't look forward to sitting through mass  her dinky class had better let out around the same time, or i'll find it difficult to keep on a happy face  she is halfway to becoming catholic  -in the name of the father, son, and the holy spirit, amen-"
"i got the radio job interview  i'm not sure whether or not i'll get the hire, but it sure would be sweet to work for a radio station  everyone cross your fingers for me please "

i am becoming obsessed with yet another video game  i think i need help  curse you dragon age 
"i hate it when the weather changes all my plans  i'm all packed and ready to go, but i'm stuck "
youtube in black is pretty cool  i like it 
considering if i would rather read or play a video game 
annoyed that people who get annoyed by me just drop the entire subject  just because i thought to add something to what you were saying didn't mean i didn't want to hear what you had to say 
"i'm ready to get my paycheck as of this second   another two days to wait, but i need money now "
today is going to be one of those days were i do things that are irrational  i should just stay in bed 
i'm loving the improved weather 
"why oh why does sprints customer service have to suck so bad? yes, i do want to pay in full, but i don't want to pay next months balance  ~someone needs to visit the wizard of oz~"
i'm not feeling like the greatest person right now  why does the way i feel often mean someone is going to be upset with me  i am torn between a sure thing and life's big adventure  which do i choose?
doughnuts do cheer me up  especially fresh doughnuts that are homemade and warm  i get the feeling i'm being bribed 
for whatever reason i can't load apps  hmmmm

"today has been almost perfect, and what makes it even better is i get tomorrow off to just chill  yep living the good life  lol"
"i need more to do   i knew i should have put some stuff off until later, damn my impulse to just get everything done as quickly as possible "
"zach might be having surgery this week, because the last time he saw a doctor they gave him a staph infection  even more reason to hate hospitals "
"i really just want to be able to soak up the nice weather, i hate that i just don't have time this week   sad "
just felt like announcing that i am such a <propmale> dork 
time to relax  checking ticket prices for a cruise this summer  i'm loving my good luck of late   smile 
i think i'm going to go see kick-ass now 
going out to enjoy the weather 
sometimes it's a good idea to not get your hopes up 
i'm upset that the trip i planned to see zach a week sooner fell through  -sigh-
extremely tired  going to see <propmale> of persia later  i hope it's as good as it looks 
i'm so not a happy camper right now  -grumpy face-
i finally got around to doing laundry  amen for clean clothes 
"lots of changes the past couple months, and even more just around the corner  soon i'll be able to set the date for my wedding "
7 years later and i get a full day off on the fourth of july!!!! i just wish i wasn't still so sick  sad 
"i can't believe i'm thinking this, but i'm ready for summer to be over  i'm bored of the heat "
"why does there need to be a reason to bake a cake? why can't the reason be, because i like cake?"

"hard couple of days, but on the bright side i finally got an ultra sound "
very sick  going back to the doctor tomorrow  hopefully i'll be better soon

i love it when zach does something une playful ected for me out of the blue  he made what could have been the worst day yesterday so much better 
"playing fable iii   fun as always, but a bit depressing "
i finally had a day off where i didn't have to run errands or do chores  it feels great to get to chill out 
"yea, i'm set for the christmas season  bring on the holiday cheer  smile "
"i love the snow, but i sure hate ice  ick!"

"i set up an event for my baby shower in feb  if you want to come, but i didn't send you an invite please let me know  it will be in wv "
"watching it snow for the 17th day in a row  waiting on my advisor to call me back and let me know that everything updated correctly this time, so i can order my books  then i'm going to take advantage of what time i have left to work on getting to lvl 85 "
"question of my week   can i make it until friday with what gas in the car now? -crossing fingers- i think i can, i think i can "
excited to get started in the teaching program!
"yea i will be up for the total eclipse of the <propfemale>  i do have to work the next morning at 6am, but seeing that i'm pregnant i'm up a million times a night anyway, so i may as well enjoy seeing a coppery red <propfemale>  lol"
i want to wish everyone a <propfemale> christmas  be safe all  i likely won't be on the next few days 
extremely stuffed after two days of huge meals  now i am ready to veg out 
i took too long of a nap yesterday and now i can't sleep  i really hope this doesn't throw off my entire routine 
"it was a long day at work, after sleeping on the couch last night  i really hope tomorrow goes better "
the sudden nice weahter was great while it lasted   welcome back snow and cold 
starting a collection of baby stuff already 
i miss having time to take a nap   ugh ugh 
i have come up with an invention  i hope it turns out to be worth it 
this is the last week before my third trimester begins  not too much longer now  i can hardly wait!
very sad to learn that borders will likely disappear this year  i will miss it greatly   so many borders memories  -sigh-
i didn't get enough sleep last night  i think i will try and take a nap soon  the meds the doctor gave me have a drowsy effect 
"i really wish the puppy would calm down already  all scamp does all day is whine, unless you give him never ending attention  you don't actually have to play with him you just have to let him attempt to tear apart everything in the house while jumping on and off your lap  he really is a sweet dog, but a little too high energy for me right now "
"less than a week until my second ultra sound appointment, and less than two months until i finally get to see my little boy  i'm super excited!"
"ended up having to go to the hospital today, and i was told it seems like i've only got another two to maybe three weeks until my baby boy will be here  i'm ready for the baby, but i'm not ready for the labor   "
"waiting for zach to get back from <propmale> hortons  i might be going south to newark again today, but my main focus is to finish pre-washing baby clothes  i can hardly believe i'm so close now!"
