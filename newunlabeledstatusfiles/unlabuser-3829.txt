how can you not want to be in your childs life??    dead beat daddies you reap what sow  so don't be mad when your child begins to despise you because you weren't there when they needed you most  i'm glad i can be there for mine  sacrifice does not go unpaid  god sees all and he doesn't like ugly  so do what you gotta do  time doesn't cost but time lost will cost you everything 
much love to my single moms out there doing it  i thank god for mine!!
paying bills   at least i can  thank god!!
just ate enough to feed a somalian village and bout to fall into the usual thanksgiving coma  praying god blesses all to be with good friends and or family!!!
monday after a 5 day weekend   draggin   
it's too darn cold outside!!
i am soooo tired     
happy new year!!!
just wanna thank all my friends for being my friends  it's nice to know there are people out there whose lives you've touched and who have made an impact on me in one way or another as well  through losing touch and living life we can all still stay connected with one another  peace love and prosperity to everyone in 2010  may god bless all you put your hands to and may you do exceedingly well in all you endeavors 
i need insects for my zoo  someone gift me some please!!

"i need 6 bricks, 4 harnesses, 2 nails and 7 boards to finish my stable  any and all help is appreciated!!"
my eardrums have fluid behind them so my hearing is diminished  it's like wearing earplugs all the time  it's really annoying     huh   wha'd you say!?!?
i have a wonderfull and amazing woman for a girlfriend!!! she's an awesome mother and friend!! you know when you come to that fork in the road theres is no wrong or right choice  later it may feel like it but you learn from that choice right?  so when i came to that fork in my relationship life    i'm glad i chose her and fell that was the last fork i'll ever come to in that respect!! i love you baby!!
"please copy and paste this into your status if you know someone or have been affected by someone who needs a punch in the face  people who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many  there is still no cure for someone who needs a punch in the face, except a punch in the face, but we can raise awareness   "
good morning all    it's gonna be a good week    i'm out on vacation the rest of the week so i can spend some time with my daughters for spring break  just bought a car that runs like a champ  man i tell ya god is goood!! praise the lord!!
"our god is a god of hope, forgiveness and second chances    is there a need in your life for any of these? take it before the lord in humbleness and watch him work!!"
nothing like a 7 mile bike ride to get the heart going    next week shootin for ten!!
do not let doubt control you  doubt gives birth to fear and when you're afraid   you run  if you do run run towards god who is there for you to strengthen you  don't ever think that you've fallen away from god and that he doesn't want to bless you and be there for you  nothing you can do will ever seperate you from gods love!!
good night seattle!!!
god is soooo good  i love how he tells you what you need to hear right when you need to hear it!!! i love you lord!!!!
the first step in healing is forgiveness   god commands it   70 times 70  praise the lord!!!
this is the day that the lord has made!! i will rejoice and be glad in it!!!
"first night back at choir practice!!! feels sooo good to be back in the house of the lord  thank god for his mercy and his grace, his love and his favor!!! i give him all the <propfemale> and honor!! thank you jesus!!!"
braveheart is a classic!!!
"beautiful day in seatlle, at the zoo with my family, wish my girls could've been here though!!"
gos is a god of second chances!!! and third and forth and so on  that doesn't mean you continue to live a sloppy life  but instead it should push you to set the bar high and watch god help you reach the heighth at which you set it  all the while knowing he will be there to pick you up should you slip and fall!!
done with another busy day of work   now off to the house of god for a little praise and worship!!
god is good all the time and don't you forget it!!!
