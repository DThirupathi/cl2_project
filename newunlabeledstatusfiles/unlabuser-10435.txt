after about an hour of unhooking and hooking wires talking to a gentlemen with an accent that was difficult to understand sometime it was decided that the dsl problem is not my modem but the phone line   supposed to be fixed this evening between 4-8   my computer is completely stressed out
dsl is still down - after leaving work early so that i could be home on time at&t didn't even show up - no phone call no note nothing   i have never had trouble with at&t before and am very dissappointed in them right now   trust me there will be a tirade of words this am
