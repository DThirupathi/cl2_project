is there anyone going to heritage's homecoming that would be able to have me spend the night afterwards so my parents don't have to stay up late?
i just realized    if i'm texting someone and i make a very noticeable typo i will send a second correcting said typo   
"jealous! of what exactly? your total lack of class, your small mindedness and ignorance or the fact you have all the looks and personality of a boiled potato!!"
"like for a drink\[] monster - your sexy\[] arizona - your cute\[] coke - your pretty\[] pepsi - your funny\[] apple juice- ugly\[] sprite - i like you\[] diet sprite - i used to like you\[] mountain dew - you should inbox me\[] minute maid - your a-m-a-z-i-n-g\[] <propfemale> ale - stranger\[] fanta - we should talk more\[] red bull - i love you\[] slushie - we should chill\[] four loko - i'd kiss you\[] coca-cola - hmu\[] water - ehh\[]powerade - make this your status so i can like it"

to everyone who gave blood today y'all are awesome  i mean seriously donations like the ones gave today saved my life march freshman year    i'm glad to have made it through that    it was scary and without that donated blood i very likely would have died    
i may be insensitive with my words but i'd rather tell you like it is then lie to your face 
i'm still not ready for the homecoming dance lol
soooo tired but i had a lot of fun last night at home coming  laugh

i hate it when people e playful ect me to be a mind reader     people need to tell me what they are thinking if they want  e playful ect me to know 
well so much for making up my mind    back to the fence    
bleh  i had a weird dream again     weird 
if i can't make up my mind how can i tell people what's on it?
i keep having weird dreams     subconscious stop beating around the bush and get to the point  or at least make it clearer
how do you e playful lain how you feel when you don't even know why you feel like you do?
well g'night fb  hoepfully i'll get some sleep with my weird dreams i've been having
i just cut my index finger doing the dishes because no one told em that the lid to our round casserole dish was chip and sharp    
be nice   you might just be the best part of someones bad day!

people should know by now that if they have something they want need to say to me they should just say it  if your honest with me and were honest the whole time i won't be bothered  not only that but i'm not easily bothered by things so just say what your going to say  i'm getting sick of the bush beating people are trying to do when dealing with me 
i found out three things today that i kind of wish i didn't    i'm not sure who to react to two of them    
"you're in a horror movie annoyed 1)decides the creepy house is safe: <propfemale> barnes\2)always has your back: <propfemale> rose\3)the smart one of the group:  <propmale> dabbs\4)the first to go missing: <propfemale> lamb\5)has a dark secret <propfemale> heywood\6)gets murdered, saving you: <propfirst> hess\7)the first to scream and fall helplessly while running: j <propfirst> hughes"
