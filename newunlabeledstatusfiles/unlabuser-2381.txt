"wow, i sure love to come home to bird corpses lined up on my front porch waiting to be buried    yep, it's spring alright, and the stupid birds are hitting my windows   "
today i messed up at a 4-way stop and stopped when i had the right of way  so i panicked and hit the gas too fast trying to make up for my ill-timed stop    the old man walking on the street i was heading for just froze and stared at me like i was the scariest thing he'd ever seen in his life  i'd consider my first drive a thirty minutes well spent 
"you have me very, very worried  you know who you are "
that's it  my life is complete  i have found a song about a girl name <propfemale> that i actually like and isn't about schizophrenic stalkers or flowers 
"no, i refuse to believe it  he's a ten year old fish, i was convinced he was going to live it forever "
