beleive and then you will see  but if you thirst to see without beleiving then you will not ever see 
got to get to work <propfemale>n   arent i <propfemale> fortunate !
two things i really despise: when things are repeated to me several times after you already told me what to do  and when doors are slammed  uuuggghhh so irritating  gosh!!
forget about the stars  shoot beyond them  beyond the universe if possible  all it takes is a little bit of faith and a wholee lot of persistence  just beleive in god!!
i sometimes hate the existence of fb  it doesnt let me do what i sshould be doing  lol
my life isnt like yours and yours isnt like mine  what works for me isnt always going to work for you  and my shoe isnt always going to fit your foot or your's isnt going to fit mine  so your e playful eriences are different and i go through things differently than you do  we are all unique and we all suceed in different ways in the right time 
oh god please give me <propfemale> because i really need it right now  its one thing after another and they all come at once  why is that?  please no one answer that 
"thereÂ´s a hole in my heart that can only be filled by you, and this hole in my heart? canÂ´t be filled with the things i do?"

sometimes you worry for how you are going to succeed in life  for how you aare going to make things possible  but what is destined to be yours will happen regardless  just need to put a little bit of an extra effort and strive longer with gods help 
"when life gets rough, pain gets more painful, water is up to your neck and we think we will drown   he is there with us, he has everything under his divine control   just trust him! he is the <propfemale> and <propfemale>, the god of wonders, the only one "

psalm 56:10 in god have i put my trust: i will not be afraid what man can do to me 
there are times in life where there are things that you want to let go of <propfemale> bad but then there is that something that jusst doesnt permit for you to do so  as much as you try its like you keep pulling it back towards you  you hold on to those emotions that should no longer be sitting there  its tiime for it to stand up and leave  ?
haha i just find it very humorous  cant help but laugh  why does it matter?
ok so i came to this  little conclusion   when i make mistakes i appreciate them more than when i have success   because of the fact that the mistakes that i have made have led me to success! thanking god for choice that i have made! love you my father!
ooooohh how i love technology! its so great and convenient! = )

"so i ask myself    why care about what others think or say, if whether i do good or not they will still speak, so then i think to myself   i really dont care what others think or say of me, because at the end i only care about god's judgement, his thought is what really counts! his approval is required! = ) love you my father!!"
i guess that certain things that happen that you might think are not so great are actually great  things get worse before they get better  even though there are rough times right now things are still going great thanks to god!he knows what he does! = )

"ok so another random thought: \ so i dont like when people try to be like others and they put their time and effort into trying to be that  i believe that you cant perfect anything better than just being yourself  so instead of wasting time of trying to be like someone else i believe that you should start putting time and effort into building your own characteristics up\""  just my thought """
