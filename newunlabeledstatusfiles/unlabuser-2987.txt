<propfemale> christmas to all and to all a good night   happy new year everyone 
"is alive    ? kh bbs is insane, but aqua is amazing "
"hates new facebook  god, why do you keep drastically changing?"
"i have 200 friends? lol, what?"
"feels like she has been under attack thanks to facebook events  but is thankful for all of the birthday wishes, and will try to get to every comment individually   laugh "
can't wait till school is over so prop guns can be made for fanime  (well at least a pistol and a knife) 
officially was not meant to hold a cal id for more than 5 mo -1yr 
"misses sex & the city, her cats, and her car  ><"
hates that she is kind of ocd because this gun would be made so much faster   annoyed 
"still not done with foam prop gun pattern because of ocd attention to detail, but the barrel has been sketched "
has completed the prop beretta pattern and has traced it onto the craft foam; tomorrow she had better not cut her hand with the box cutter 
the profile pict has finally changed! now featuring <propmale> langdon and <propfemale> dyer 
is excited that <propmale> langdon and now <propfemale> dyer will be at fanime again! and also wonders if they'll feel like she is stalking them as she will turn up as sheva again    
"fanime: \friday- j-pop inspired (ie  namie amuro)\sat- sheva alomar  love \sunday -sheva alomar (re gathering ftw!)\mon- normal clothes"
jury duty is boring  that is all 
is about to kick into ax mode 
"for all intents and purposes, my psp is dead  it turns on, but the speakers don't work and now it barely reads my games, not to mention the battery will shut off if i touch the umd door wrong  :tears: but <propfirst> is excited for <propfemale> vs  capcom 3 and street fighter x tekken "
has replaced her old dead psp with a new one thanks to mom  :heart:
bleach 414 = wth  ><
"technically hasn't started the <propfemale> fang cosplay, but is already overwhelmed by it  god, cornrows!"
is leaving for hawaii at 12 surprise 0 and will have no internet (unless a certain hotel has computers) so don't comment unless you can wait till friday  evening 
is home and happy to see her kitties  but will miss them when she leaves in a week 
"is in berkeley  call, text, or fb if you want to <propfemale> before classes "
just realized the reason a cosplay friend hasn't added her yet is because she couldni't be searched for on facebook   annoyed 
?taku takahashi = musical genius 
annoyed that <propfemale> seems to think <propmale> people spending money will end economic crisises 
just shared a plane ride with the cool kids from st  mos  i'm looking at you nghia-piotr trong <propfemale> and <propfirst>   >d
fang stuff has been purchased  20% still needed for costume 
has ip fang photos on the iptouch that facebook won't let me upload (???Â´)
believes fanime 2011 will see her with more than 10 safety pins 
booo new facebook  one more day  all i wanted was one more day  
jun is in my tekken tag 2! yes plz!!  laugh 
thanks for all of birthday wishes everyone!
