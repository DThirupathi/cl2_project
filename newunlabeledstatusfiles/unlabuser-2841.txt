the last dying minutes of the year   
"?????????????????????????????????????\?????????????????????????????????????\?????????????????????????????????????\?????????????????????????????????????\?????????????????????????????????????"
school starts in 3 days   
"one shall not know anger, nor hatred, nor love "
"there is no emotion, there is peace \there is no ignorance, there is knowledge \there is no passion, there is serenity \\there is no chaos, there is harmony \there is no death, there is the force "
"love is a raw emotion  if you fall in love, it will dominate your <propfemale> forever "
"by loving everything without attachment, you will find peace "
"there are always two  no more, no less: a master and an apprentice "
has chronic depression   sad 
is furious at himself for not making what he should have on the math crct!!!
had an awesome day at school!!!  smile 
nooooooo! nooooooo!  crying 
"someday, you'll be sorry!!!"
"is e playful eriencing a shudder of electricity through his whole body  it's more of somebody's presense that's making me feel this way   someone une playful ected  someone who i'd never thought, i'd run into while holding a <propfemale> wars novel  someone whose mere presense and sight made me run quickly and listen to the jedi code, telling me to be mindful of my thoughts   her name, i can not mention "
adventure  heh! excitement  heh! a jedi craves not these things!
"into exile, i must go  failed, i have "
"has failed  sad  i must understand that a jedi is a jedi, first and foremost, and only  for a jedi to divide his attention between the will of the force and the will of others is to invite disaster  if only i was a potential padawan while i was a young child and not admitted late   sad  the attachment to an individual is growing stronger inside of me   and i can't stop it   sad "
omg  my friends went from 91 to 89  another individual blocked me  screw you people!!!
"there is no escape  don't make me destroy you   luke, you do not yet realize your importance  you have only begun to discover your power  join me, and i will complete your training  with our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy "
if you're not with me   then you're my enemy!
"obi-wan: it's over anakin! i have the high grounds!\anakin: you underestimate my power!\obi-wan: don't try it  \anakin: (screams)\obi-wan: you were the chosen one! it was said that you would destroy the sith, not join them! bring balance to the force, not leave in darkness!\anakin: (screams) i hate you!!!\obi-wan: you were my brother anakin  i loved you "
"anakin: you turned her against me!\obi-wan: you have done that yourself!\anakin: you will not take her from me!\obi-wan: your anger and your lust for power have already done that  you have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now   until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy \anakin: don't lecture me obi-wan  i see through the lies of the jedi  i do not fear the dark side as you do!"
"anakin: i'd much rather dream about padme  just being around her again is   intoxicating \obi-wan: be mindful of your thoughts anakin, they betray you  you have made a commitment to the jedi order, a commitment not easily broken "
"darth vader: obi-wan never told you what happened to your father \<propmale>: he told me enough! he told me you killed him!\darth vader: no  i am your father  \<propmale>  no  that's not true  that's impossible!\darth vader: search your feelings, you know it to be true!\<propmale>: nooo! noooooo!"
don't underestimate the force 
"mace windu: i am going to end this, once and for all!\anakin: you can't  he must stand trial!\mace windu: he has control of the senate and the courts! he's too dangerous to be left alive!\anakin: it's not the jedi way  he must live!\palpatine: please don't!\anakin: i need him!\palpatine: please don't!\anakin: no!!! (slices off windu's hand)\mace windu: (screams)\palpatine: power!!! unlimited power!!!"
"yoda: not if anything to say about it, i have! at an end, your rule is! and not short enough, it was  if so powerful you are, why leave? (activates lightsaber) \darth sidious: you will not stop me! darth vader will become more powerful than either of us! (activates lightsaber) \yoda: faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the force "
"anakin: it wouldn't have to be that way  we could keep it a secret  \padme: then we'd be living a lie  one we couldn't keep up with no matter what  i couldn't do that  could you anakin? could you live like that?\anakin: no  you're right  it would destroy us  \\me:    and it did "
"darth sidious: lord vader  can you hear me?\darth vader: yes, master  where is padme? is she safe? is she alright?\darth sidious: it seems that in your anger, you killed her  \darth vader: i? i couldn't have! she was alive! i felt it!\darth vader: (damages everything around him with the power of his rage and grief)  noooooooooooo!!!"
"mace windu: you are under arrest, my lord!\darth sidious: anakin, i told you it would come to this! i was right  the jedi are taking over!\mace windu: the oppression of the sith will never return! you have lost!\darth sidious: no  no, no, you will die! (blasts force lightning on mace windu)\darth sidious: he's a traitor!!!"
"you have failed me for the last time, admiral!"
"obi-wan: i have failed you, anakin  i have failed you  \anakin: i should have known the jedi were plotting to take over!\obi-wan: anakin, chancellor palpatine is evil!\anakin: from my point of view, the jedi are evil!\obi-wan: well then you are lost!"
"darth vader: i've been waiting for you obi-wan  we meet again at last  the circle is now complete  when i left you, i was but the learner, now i am the master  \obi-wan: only a master of evil, darth!\darth vader: your powers are weak, old man  \obi-wan: you can't win, darth  if you strike me down, i shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine "
"palpatine did horrible things to him  made him suspicious of his friends so they wouldn't be friends anymore  made him kill younglings so no one would ever trust him again  made him alone  made it so nobody else in the universe understood him   except palpatine  i bet, just before he became darth vader, he probably hated palpatine  but palpatine had worked it out so that he was the only one anakin skywalker had "
"a jedi is a jedi, first and foremost, and only  for a jedi to divide his attention between the will of the force and the will of others is to invite disaster "
"do not see a lightsaber duel as a choice between winning and losing  every duel can have many, many outcomes  when you concentrate solely on winningâ€”in lightsaber duels as in everything elseâ€”you sully your victory  winning becomes worse than losing  it is better to lose than to win badly  and it is always better to end a duel peacefully than to win or lose "
"learn to recognize when speed is not important  race when being first is important; move at your own pace at all other times  it is not necessary to always strike the first blow, to provide the first solution, or to reach a goal before anyone else does  in fact, it is sometimes vital to strike the last blow, to give the final answer, or to arrive after everyone else "
"the acceptance of others is not a guarantee  like everyone else, a jedi is accepted or not based on his behavior  the jedi who believes that he is more important than others only demonstrates that his opinion is to be ignored "
"i wear my robe so that i am warm; i <propfemale> my lightsaber so that i am safe; and i keep enough credits for my next meal, so that i am not hungry  if the force wants me to have more, it finds a way of letting me know "
"empathy is a jedi trait  empathy leads to understanding, understanding leads to compassion, compassion leads to love  there is no place for love for a sith  only hate "
"i crave only power and purpose  with power, anything you want or need can simply be taken  with purpose, life has meaning "
"age is indeed a curious thing  as i grow older, i see less clearly in the dark, but i see the dark more clearly "
"failure has a thousand e playful lainations, success doesn't need one "
"who's the more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows him?"
"it is not enough that i succeed  everyone else, must fail "
your anger gives you great power  but if you let it   it will destroy you 
"the sith rely on their passion for their strength  they think inward, only about themselves "
"always two, there are  no more, no less: a master and an apprentice "
"deliver more than you promise  the best way to be always certain of this is to deliver much, even when you promise nothing "
hey! this rocks! hey!
"until the possible becomes actual, it is only a distraction "
"when you look at the dark side, careful you must be   for the dark side looks back "
"listen to the force, cade  a jedi's first concern is to preserve life "
"fear attracts the fearful, the strong, the weak, the innocent, the corrupt  fear  fear is my ally "
"strong am i with the force, but not that strong  twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall  that is the way of things   the way of the force "
"ulic qel-droma: master arca, freedon nadd was a jedi  how can a jedi, trained in the ways of the light, fall victim to the dark side? \arca jeth: it has happened more than once  fortunately it does not happen oftenâ€”ulic, my sonâ€¦pray that it never happens to you "
"nadd spoke of the ancient sith foretellingsâ€¦that the dark lords will come again  i heard similar stories from the jedi holocron  these prophecies chill my blood  there may be something to themâ€¦but the future depends on us  we jedi must cling to the light  the light is our strength and our ally  with the light of the force, the jedi will stand foreverâ€¦remember, ulicâ€¦where there is lightâ€¦there can be no darkness "
at last we will reveal ourselves to the jedi  at last we will have revenge 
"here i stand, helpless and left for dead   sad "
"jedi don't friend sith who are obsessed with the dark side of the force  if they want to start arguments over the force, they're on!"
screw palpatine  may he rot forever in the netherworld of the force 
obi-wan   promise me you will train the boy  he   is the chosen one  he   will bring balance  train him 
all this thought about the galactic civil war and world war ii has led me to asking this question: who was worse: palpatine or hitler?
a jedi does not cling to the past 
"if <propfemale> wars didn't exist, then i wouldn't give a hoot about youtube "
i'm not a perfect person  there are many things that i wish i didn't do  but i continue learning  i never meant to do those things to you 
"the force is what gives a jedi his power  it's an energy field created by all living things  it surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together "
"there are many realities in the universe, some of them quite harsh  one reality that is inescapable is that there is nothing more valuable than a friend  more than food, more than shelter, and more than weaponry, an ally can save your life "
duel of the fates 
across the stars
battle of the heroes
anakin's betrayal
the imperial march
"apology accepted, captain needa "
"i don't have the answer to why he turned  i can only ask myself that question, over and over again "
"every second, you are closer to death "
she actually still exists!!! (not that i thought that she didn't still exist)  but i saw her!!! for the first time in months!!!
"it's better to never start something, than to start it and never finish it  once you start something, you must finish it "
"obi-wan kenobi: why do i get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?\anakin skywalker: don't say that, master  you're the closest thing i have to a father "
"you know, don't you? if the jedi destroy me, any <propmale> of saving her will be lost "
"anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader "
"is once again depressed, alone, and   screwed!!!  crying "
"don't go  your presence is soothing  your absence is distressful  but yet, you refuse to notice my presence and leave me   alone and depressed   crying "
i'm sorry that i hurt you  it's something i must live with everyday  and all the pain i put you through  i wish that i could take it all away  and me the one who catches all your tears  that's why i need you to hear  i found out a reason for me to change who i used to be  a reason to start over new  and the reason is you 
"i sense much hatred in you  much arrogance  you tend to cling to the past and focus very little on the present  you lack compassion  you lack empathy  you lack sympathy  or is it just towards me? all of your hatred, your lack of compassion and sympathy  is it all just towards me? i don't have the answer  i can only ask myself that question, over and over again "
"is e playful eriencing panic attacks, stress, depression, and headaches   crying "
miss  arrogant-lady  stop tormenting me  the mind can only take so much 
poison in my bloodstream  suffering on my mind  pain and grief in my heart  tears on my face  death in my future  here i stand now   helpless and left for dead   crying 
"do a thousand good deeds and people will forget them  do one bad thing and people will remember it forever, and you will be hated forever  but you will never be remembered or liked again for all of those thousands of good deeds that you once did  leaving a bad lasting impression of yourself on others can destroy you  never make this mistake, as i did  it will destroy you, as it does me, a little bit each day   crying "
"attachment clouds my vision  people act irrationally and unpredictably when they are emotionally attached to another person or an object  that irrational behavior causes pain, regretted acts, and more irrational behavior when the person or object is threatened  i must come to my senses  i must be more mindful of my thoughts, because so far, all theyâ€™ve done is betrayed me   sad "
"things that are on my mind: \\people just ain't no good  a thing that's well understood  \\the emperor is not as forgiving as i am  \\i hate you!!!\\please don't!!!\\no!!! *screams and cries*\\scarred forever   "
"please say something to me  you can't be silent forever  i sense your presence fading   fading  i have said it many times: i'm sorry that i hurt you  it's something i must live with everyday  i don't know what i have done to you  i don't know why you won't speak to me  these are things that i can only ask myself, over and over again   sad "
"<propmale>, you do not yet realize your importance  you have only begun to discover your power  join me, and i will complete your training  with our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy "

"secrets are dangerous \secrets are difficult \secrets can kill "
"8th grade <propfemale> has revealed its true identity  it's no more the calm, serene, peaceful, and welcoming class that it was during the first couple of weeks of school  it is now a stressful, scary, difficult, and panic-inducing class "
i still have much to learn 
"i am a math teacher  i am a banana  only one of these statements is true and the other is a lie  i don't have yellow skin and i'm not a good source of vitamins, so my inductive reasoning says that i'm not a banana  so if i'm not a banana, then i must be a math teacher "
<propmale> + charter internet = peace of mind and success ?

i am disabling all communications with other living flesh  no one talk to me  i'm inferior 
independence is the key to success  dependence leads to failure and betrayal 
i don't get how people use safari on a pc  it's so slow!
what?! i spend the weekend finishing all those math assignments and (even though i made 100s on three on them) they didn't raise my grade by even a point?!!?!?!? what's up with that?!
"reading logs, a shakespeare play for an abstract, the elizabethan fair, hard stuff and stupid careless mistakes from me that gets me a sucky 94   yep   i'm screwed "
"no matter how hard i try, i still fail   "

theta sessions are very good at replacing 4 hours of sleep  <propfemale> sessions are excellent at rejuvenating the body with 2 hours of sleep  i think i've solved my sleep deficiency problems   
"wise men profit more from fools than fools from wise men; for the wise men shun the mistakes of fools, but fools do not imitate the successes of the wise "
"if you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another <propmale> for you  what we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down "
i daresay one profits more by the mistakes one makes off one's own bat than by doing the right thing on somebody's else advice 
strange  i had a dream about the former person i liked  what could this mean   ?
it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving

"lifted head fog, increased mind power, neural pathway growth, improved study, and lasting energy "
i am a failure that made a 26 on an assignment

"wow, it's almost 5 am and i'm still up practicing for the word parts quiz  after this, i think i better go and consolidate my memory "
i'm going to end my friendship with a lot of people 
what the crap?! i cannot have an 83 in social studies! not social studies! one of the most freakin' easiest classes! that's it! i'm such an idiot failure! i got a 26 on an assignment!!! why!? and people actually made a 100 on that?! that's it! i've had it! i'm never going to recover from a sulky mood until i get my grade where it should be! here now official: nobody talk to me ever again!
"you're the weak one   and you'll never know love or friendship   and i feel sorry for you \--<propmale> potter"
i'm screwed 
i've just made my desktop more aesthetically appealing 
capital punishment is the cruelest and most painful thing you can do to someone  i can't think of anything that hurts (physically) more 
"dumbo is like the most annoying show!\--<propfemale> english"
i'm sorry pillow  you've drowned in my tears     crying 
"it is not our abilities that make us who we are, but rather our choices "
the magnificent power of the subconscious mind 
google chrome uses too much memory   or maybe it's just the extensions 
"ticked off that i made an 80 on the radical e playful ressions task, but satisfied that i have a 95 in math "

ms  mcneeley is an awesome teacher  she gives a taste of what real life feels like and not the laziness and stupidity we've grown in  the proof of that are all the people who insult her and the work she assigns in their statuses 
i'm screwed! d:
"people absolutely positively hate me from the depths of their dark souls! and that's the truth! and yes, one person does count "
success is 80% mental and 20% physical 
"i demand to know how you can get a 70% as a grade for having the minimum required content for an assignment! if you're not given the maximum work you can do, all you have left to work with is the minimum! if i have the minimum required content why the crap did i make 70 and not a 100?! and it's a freakin' summative grade!"
i am a stupid failure face who apparently doesn't do enough work and receive enough self punishment 
i'm totally pissed off! i'm a failure that can't retain or comprehend anything! i make terrible grades and apparently don't try hard enough!
all that we are is a result of what we have thought 
"wow  i slept from 3 pm to 11 pm  guess i'll just do math and other schoolwork for the rest of the night  this is how i spent my life on saturday, march 12, 2011 "
"only those who dare to fail greatly, can ever achieve greatly "
"today on march 14, 2011 is the final release of microsoft internet e playful lorer 9!!!"

nightmare upon nightmare   what's happening to me?
i am a left brain thinker 
internet e playful lorer 9 is stupid  you can't even use it unless you have a graphics processing unit  stupid unstable buggy browser  such a disappointment
