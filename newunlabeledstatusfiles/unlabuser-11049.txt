i dont know what to do anymore  i dont really want to be here i dont really want to be in this much pain    but the only think i can do is smile and pretend my hearts not breaking away  heart-broken 
i love him    he loves her    she loves he    im stuck on the outside of everything that was once mine
"no one will get this right  my middle name______, my age_____, my full birthday_____, who's the love of my life______, my best friend___________, my fav color_________, my favorite food_______, my moms and dads name___________  put this as your status see who knows you best ?"
when i see it   it breaks my heart and you dont even know     heart-broken 
"and when i think about it my heart feels like it has stopped beating  my stomach feels like its not even there and my chest wont take in any air    when when i acually see it and know what it is my heart stops, my stomach e playful lodes, and my chests stops moving once and for all   and alll because of you"

"why is it that everytime i look at him, when i see his face, or even his picture, my chest hurts? why is it that when i heard about him talking to other girls i start to cry? why do i have to suffer  by seeing what he truely is   why couldnt i believe the lie? why is it that im still in love with him    and im not aloud to know why   ?"
