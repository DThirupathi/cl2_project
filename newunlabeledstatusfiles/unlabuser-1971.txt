is grounded and i dont know why    
"potrei parlarti ancora (di me)  delle lacrime che ho pianto,  di quel sorriso spento che,  nasconde centomila incognite,  di occhi estranei si di te   ,  di come avrai potuto fingere     ti prego resta qui     continuo a chiedermi,  continuo a illudermi,"

lets commit the perfect act of love  i'll give you my heart if you give me ours  because that is all that i have left to give you  ~quote from my poem  smile  ~
"love is strong, but it's also weak  when you let some one in, you open yourself to pain, but that pain isn't always bad  it lets you learn, and helps you grow  thereâ€™s only one down side     if you let the wrong person in you lose yourself and your ability to love again "
rest in peace <propfirst> <propfirst> <propmale>  i will always love you  you were my first love now your my first death of this year  i just hope this isn't true that i have lost you

"if you love something set it free if it dosen't return it was never meant to be if it does love it and treasure it forever i dream in darkness i sleep to die erase the silence,my life,my burning ashes "
"i wish this day was over! i got punched in the eye and arm then i had a tennis ball hit me in the arm and then i was freakin kicked  what have i done wrong to desvere this? plus,gerald wasn't there  *sad face*"
"find a heart that will l?ve you at your worst,and arms that will hold you at your weakest  love "
"whenever i cry and somebody asks me whats wrong and i say nothing, i want them to look me in the eyes and say: tell me the truth "
dad is being horrible today  i already got yelled at three times  i really hope he will be nicer when <propfirst> comes over  he better or else 
i'm over this pettiness  i know i was probably the cause of most of this so whoever is my enemy i wanna apologize for anything and everything i have ever done to you  i really mean this and everything i'am saying comes from the heart i know im stupid and cause a lot of lame things that hurt people but you know what? i'm human and i know i will do alot of those things because humans make mistakes 
i feel better about being the bigger man and apologizing to every single hater and enemey for whatever the hell i did to them yeah i know i screwed alot of people over but thats because i'm human and humans do alot of stupid crap plus every1 has probably told someone a secert to someone else everyone is pissed at me whatever i'm so over the petty drama that happens over a mistake 
i'm very tired and i don't feel good i hope tomorrow will be better today was amazing!
hanging with <propfirst> and <propfirst> tonight my parents are like being wayy overprotective they seriously don't trust me at all oh well    such is life 
doesnt feel too well after him breaking my heart into small little pieces i give him everything and now i'm left with nothing i'm dying on the inside just remember i will always love you <propfirst> <propfirst> neace and i will always wait for you 
this feels sooo horrible this dying sensation that my body is going through i have cried for many hours straight and i think i will be doing it again today how did my life go from very good to horrible in a matter of 1 second?i really need him i also don't think he gave me a real <propmale> 
i know what i have to do today might turn into a very good thing 
today feels like a weird ass dream i'm soooo scared to wake tomorrow and find that all the stuff that happened today was a dream that would be horrible and i would burst into tears i also might just go insane    oh wait i think i already have gone insane   
"take me in, cuddle me, hold me, kiss me and sweep me off my feet pick me up and lift me to the <propfemale> while i look down upon your pale white skin in total awe,put me down so i can look up to you like a god while you dominate me, push me onto the cold green earth with a passion burning so deep in your eyes your hair sweeps on and all over my chest, that soft hair that somehow carries a flame "
ur arms r my castle ur heart is my sky they wipe away tears that i cry u make me rise when i fall cuz everytime we touch i get this feeling and everytime we kiss i swear i could fly cant u feel my heart beat fast i want this to last need u by my side i feel this static and everytime we kiss i reach for the sky cant u hear my heart beat slow i can't let u go want u in my life 
i'm really tired and bored all i want is him next to me   meh today is boring 
why do i smile at the sound of your voice?why do i let you take over me as if i had no choice?why do i let you touch me in places never touched?why do i like to have you around so much?why do i melt at the tenderness of your kiss?why do i feel like i could live forever like this?why do i put my heart in your hands?why do i answer to your every demand?
"so sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left i know that i can find the fire in your eyes i'm going all the way, get away, please you take the breath right out of me you left a hole where my heart should be you got to fight just to make it through,'cause i will be the death of you "
wonders what he is feeling and thinking when he is around me he has me <propfemale> scared and has me asking questions right now 
bored and i really wish i was hanging out with him today but oh well maybe i should get my haircut or chill with my bestie 
"im gonna smile like nothings wrong, talk like everything is perfect, act like its all a dream, and pretend its not hurting me"
i'm sad and scared i really hope he doesn't break my heart into another million pieces if he does i'm not sure what i would think or do i love him with all my heart but if he wants to be a loner than he can his happiness is worth my depression 
"u said the l word something forbidden for me\&yet u lie to me with a smile why do i feel so compelled to wait?my heart feels so heavy & so filled with sadness\a feeling i have never felt covers me&it seem to be suffocating me tears run down my face in rivers i cant help myself\i want to fall into the darkness\i feel so shattered all because of u\u said u would never hurt me but remember i told u,u would hurt me "
wants to know what he was thinking i really think he is afraid of commitment   or am i really that bad of a person?  annoyed 
"i'm in that \i don't know\"" mood where everything makes me mad or depressed it sucks when you are thinking about that one person who broke your heart into a zillion pieces but still love him more than ever """
"thinking of you where ever you are we pray for our sorrows to end, and hope that our hearts will blend  now i will step foward to realize this wish,and who knows  starting a new journy may not be so hard  or maybe it has already begun  there are many worlds, but they share the same sky  one sky- one <propfemale>"
"i just don't know what to do anymore,\my heart it aches, my heart it's sore \i love you more than you could know,\and i don't want to ever let you go \so even if i'm just a friend,\i'll always love you until the end "
my parents take anything as something sexual   great for me   not i totally hate people and the world right now 
i want my nemo back its killing me to see him act like nothing truly happened between us sooo much on my mind   off to the world of my thoughts    
trying to convince my parents to let me get a tattoo for my birthday or something 
"when i'm alone my emotions and thoughts come to the surface i hate when that happens \still trying to convince my parents to let me have a tattoo for my 16th birthday or something   "
i feel like i'm missing something maybe its just me   oh well 
too much on my mind i just really cant get anything or anyone off my mind what is up with that i wonder?trey's party was amazing!
"i loved him,i've bled for him i've even given alot of time to him   maybe other things too he treats me like i'm a dog now i'm going to ignore him or at least try to i'm going to get over him and move on in my life   because i can say this:it wasn't meant to be if he is going to screw with my mind and rip my heart into a zillion pieces i guess i was never good for you, <propfirst> <propfirst> neace  "
my mommy and i gotz matching rings today! they are silver bands with <propfemale> in them! so pretty feels crappy since i dont know how long   
"darling what is going on?\honestly that never happened \lying is your favorite passion \leave me, go where you belong\higher heels and lipstick napkins \dying is your latest fashion "
i'm soooo screwed! i feel like i'm going to bomb all my finals and be a freshman again    2013 looks like its turning into 2014 for me
