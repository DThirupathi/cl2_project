"thinks exercising outside is completely different from exercising inside  i thought i was going to fall over yesterday, got woozy and a bit nauseated  evidently i need to wait even later   sun-going-down later "
"my poor daddy is sick for the first time in about 18 years   poor daddy! unfortunately, i have to avoid him like the plague  i don't want to take risks with my moronic immune system!"
"nearly read an entire novel in one day  sometimes i manage to finish them, but my poor eyes starting killing me "

wants to cook now but has to wait until tomorrow  must remember to take the phyllo and pie crust dough out of the freezer tonight! mm   pie made with homemade pie crust    however slicing the pears will take forever  sigh 
"my pear pie recipe made me end up with two pies  but hey, too much pie does not exist! store bought bottom crust + homemade upper crust = deliciousness  and zomg phyllo is evil!  oooh i'm going to steal <propfirst>'s theme  <propfemale>'s advice for the day: to peel fruit for a pie use a vegetable peeler  instead of slicing fruit with a knife use a grater! much more e playful edient and it comes out splendidly "

getting sick this often again worries me  i can only hope the past has not come to haunt me 
"is still making it work though a wrench has been thrown in her plans  (finals conflict, the only reschedule time is at 8am saturday morning  i have to be in class at 7 smile 0   which means i'll have to wake up @5am to get my ass to uga on time ) oh, joy  at least my research paper is 95% complete   just need methodology  that'll take about 30mins  sigh "
three down and one to go  the soci one will take the most time   i'll have to get at least a third of the study guide and reading done today    at least i'll be free after tuesday  waking up @5 sucked and espaÃ±ol casi me matÃ³    -__-  vamos a esperar que apruebe
