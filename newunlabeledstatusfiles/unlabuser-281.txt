"if you learn anything in life it should be that you learn who you are inside  always be who you are and don't let anyone change that  we are perfect in our own ways  and no one should try to change that  we can't be perfect in others eyes, but we can be in our eyes"

today is going to be a great day for me
saturday is almost over for me  been a pretty good day  hope everyone had a good day today
the past is the past  and i'm happy to leave it there
going to a revolving restaurant today with my grandparents in cinci  i'm excited
watching my little baby sister  so cute when she smiles  smile 
another chapter of my life  last time i'm going to be 15  i had a great year being 15  learned a lot and e playful erienced even more  time to start the next chapter  wonder what the first line will be     smile 
finally 16  taking my permit test tomorrow  hope i pass
"\are you ready to hear me talk non-stop for like five hours tomorrow?\"" -julia\",05b6398b2e9a94394257f63bdc248311,today is the day i pass or fail my permit test 
i got my permit  i can drive now
just took <propfemale> home  it was a good day
first time driving today  wasn't bad at all 
happy thanksgiving everyone  time to eat till we get fat lol
about to eat a lot of great food my mother made  i'm going to gain 40 pounds today lol
if you can't let go of the past then you can never reach the future  that's why everyday is a gift because you know the past but not the future  live everyday like it's your last
if you had one wish what would it be   
am prob  going to <propfemale> out in the park with a really good friend  can't wait
i just had a great time with serenity today  she is amazing and a great friend  i can't wait to <propfemale> out with her again
got back from the football game  had a great time with my friend <propfemale>  but <propfirst> county lost  that sucks
everyone wants to fall in love and be happy  but what they don't know is happiness comes from inside of you  try loving yourself before another person
i promised to be there for you  guess i still am  i promised to never hurt you  guess i didn't  i promised to always love you     haha sorry i lied  wish you could see me now baby  im doing really good without you  smile 
im starting to really like this girl  and i never thought i would want to date again  but i keep thinking about her 
ugh i hate homework  really dont want to do it
my future is mine  ill never give up on my dreams  people may knock me down  but i always get back up  what doesn't kill us makes us stronger 
trying to find a job  i want to work now  could use the extra money
another rainy day  but i like the rain  it's relaxing and peaceful
you know that everyone gets their heart broken  it happens to the best of us  but i've found that you can't cure a broken heart  i found that the easiest way to stop the pain is to let go of the past  it's one of the hardest things to do
my life is a roller coaster sometimes  think about the top thrill dragster  thats my life lol  i go up and down  but sometimes i get stuck up at the top  thats always fun lol
today just keeps getting better and better  not!
its been a long day  cant wait for friday  heading to ohio and hunting for ghosts  going to be fun
going to watch <propfemale> play basketball  the ghost hunting all night  yay!
"i got a tape recorder, a camera, two flashlights, and magnets  i'm ready to catch me a ghost"
i'm at the haunted hospital  time to find me a ghost
this place is so creepy  you get cold chills down your back  i think this is a really haunted place
well we are taking a little break  nothing has happened yet  trying to talk or get touched by a ghost  but just creepy feelings so far 
got really weird chills in the old operating room and the 7th floor north  only two places that happened  also a door slammed for no reason on the 7th floor  weird
okay i think i just talked to a ghost  i was in the lobby and i heard a knocking sound  and i asked if anyone was there and to knock again  it happened again  and i keeper saying that for a while and it keeled happening about 2 seconds after i said it 
then i said keep knocking and i got louder till it was like someone hit a table with their fist  and we went to the next floor to see if anyone wad above us  there was no one      
i really wish i could read peoples minds sometimes  to see what they are feeling so i can understand what they want from me
there is not much to do at 2 in the morning
its sunday  school tomorrow ugh!!
i can't wait for this week to be over  i love being able to sleep in all day
"if you had one wish, what would it be         "
its almost friday and im really happy  can't wait to sleep in 
i take life to serious  i need to stop caring and have more fun  lifes to short to let people get on you nerves lol
"hey, remember me?\\we used to be best friends \i'd love to talk to you  don't ignore this \i just want to know how you're doing and how your life is going \\let's chat it up  <propfemale> jeffies a k a my ex  its been 3 weeks since i talked to her  she pushed me out and now she wants me in  welcome to my life lol  sorry baby but i told you that you would live with your mistake  smile "
going to a christmas party with some friends  going to be a crazy night knowing them lol
write me a question about anything and send it to me and ill answer it
i am really bored  idk what to do this weekend 
its so stupid when people on fb delete you for no reason  i dont get it lol
haha okay well idk how that other status got up there by i spy  but i didnt write that lol
really these dang things need to stop changing my status 
dailybooth is so great  i love it
heading off to the mall  going to buy me some stuff
no school tomorrow  lets kiss summer goodbye
people can be hateful  but people can be kind  i have talked to people around the world  and no one is alone  because people do care out there  and they do have your back
people have some dark pasts  some unspoken words that have changed their lives  they cant run from it  it controls them  but the one thing im trying to get them to do is to stop running and fight  control your life  dont let your past control your future
well idk what to write tonight  umm we have no school again  and im just going to relax again tomorrow 
we will have school tomorrow i would say
another snow storm tonight  i will prob see you all after the new year's lol
what is pain of the body mind and heart? is it a reaction of the brain? is it longing for something gone? or is it what makes us human? pain shows we are alive  and what doesn't kill us makes us so much stronger  everyone knows the sting of pain
life takes you many places  you can go into your worst nightmare or into the best dream  you can live life or let it control you  take everyday as a learning e playful erience  and never forget your dreams  they are what keep us going when everything seems lost
i learned a lot over the past couple of months  i learned how people really can be  how they can say to your face that they are playing you and how they can quit caring for you in a split second  but not everyone is like that  the most important thing i learned in these last couple of months is that i am who i am  and that im perfect the way i am because no one is truely perfect 
its been a really good day  can't wait to see what tomorrow holds for me
i am so bored right now  there is not much i can do at 12 smile 0  comment if you want to talk
really don't know if coming to fb for advice is good but i really need it  my ex keeps texting me and i haven't talked to her in over a month  she acts like she cares but im scared of getting hurt again  what should i do!!???
<propfemale> only if you could read this  im never texting you back  you will never get the pleasure of talking to me  you lost everything with me  everything is gone  and im happy you didn't waste anymore of my time by dating me  thanks love
does anyone know if we have school tomorrow?
another snow day  just relaxing all day
"why is it when you want someone they don't want you  and then when you moved on, they want you as a friend even tho they hurt you?? i don't get it  i told you that when im gone im never coming back  so quit texting me!! lol"
does anyone know where to find the stuff for the musical? its on who's teacher <propfemale>?
im am going to suck at the musical
"\yea we're heading for a heart heart heartbreak and i don't ever want to hear you say  don't say you love me don't even  don't say you love me your leavin\"""""
goodbye everyone  i heading to <propmale> soon  going there for christmas and the new year's  i wish you all a <propfemale> christmas and a happy new year!!
im in florida now  we just got to the resort  this place is really nice  oh and meryy christmas in a couple of hours everyone 
<propfemale> christmas everyone  im heading off to downtown disney  see ya  smile 
<propfemale> christmas still  just got done from downtown disney  it was really fun and im having a great time  sucks for all you in the cold lol  its great and warm down here  smile  
been shopping all day  ut is so crowded down here  but tomorrow should be fun  im going to <propmale> potter
you know for it being florida its kind of cold  its been <propfemale> witch makes it cold  i want it to warm up again lol
if we lose ourselves in this world then we can never stand out in a crowd  we before a rain drop in the wide open sea  we can never lose what we are  no matter how many times we get kicked down  lets all become the rainbow and not the rain drop
i am so tired today  i got back from islands of adventure and happy potter and it was crazy  but it was worth it  today was a really good day  and i go to disney tomorrow  can't wait
whew disney has been a fun and packed trip  so since tomorrow is magic kingdom and the new year's celebration i got a question  im in the place where wishes come true so tell me your new year's wish people??!!! message me it or comment on my status  whats your wish      
well i prob won't be on this tomorrow so happy new year's to everyone  i wish you all the best of the last day of 2010
if you had one day left to live what would you do? would you go party and blow all your money? would you go cry? be with your loved ones? well me i would go lay down on a beach somewhere and listen to some good music  and watch my last sunset over the waters of my life
"we all go through life searching for something  we try to find the thing that will give us eternal joy  we feel the need to be happy even if our world is falling apart around us  that's when we hold on to that thing we searched our lives for, and we never let go"
no matter what happens i know that i will be okay  i have been high as the clouds and i have gotten shot down and destroyed  but it made me stronger  i've had a lot of mistakes in my life but i learned to be a better person  and i hope that i will be that great person to someone special one day 
\this is now, that was then\05b6398b2e9a94394257f63bdc248311,i just got done trying out for the musical  i hope i get a good part!!!!!
we only live once  so shouldn't we do all we can to make this one life great? you don't need money to have a amazing life  all you need is family and that love of your soul mate  the poorest people can be the happiest  isn't that what we all want is happiness?
well hasn't been the best week but at least its friday 
we risk everything to get what we want  we throw it all on the line and hope for a good outcome  yet sometimes its not what we want in the end  so we try again and again just waiting for our <propmale>  and when that <propmale> comes we give it all we have and more  thats the beauty of humans  we never give up and never stay down
"we all have a reason for being alive  some say we are here to do something good for the world  well i know what my reason for living is  im taking all the anger, the hate, the pain out of this world  im going to start a storm that can never be stopped, and it will ripple through history  this world will become a better place for my kids  we can all start the storm togther     who's with me!!!!"
all i ever do is to try to make others happy  i bend over backwards for them  then i get told i'm not good enough  well i'm done making others happy if i'm not going to get the respect i deserve from them 
as i look up at the <propfemale>s tonight i will see your beautiful eyes <propfemale>ing down on me bc you will be looking at that same <propfemale>  yet after being so long away from you i won't know how to feel  i lost everything for you when you walked away  so tonight when you see that <propfemale> just know i'm doing great without you
i am so bored today
idk what to write on fb anymore  im running out of my good stuff that i write  anyone got any good topics for me to write about next??
oh parents  they are the best and worst things teens know  but even after the fights and yelling they are still there for you  and you got them forever  they will never turn their backs on you  so they are not so bad lol
well im saying that we won't have school again tomorrow 
hey our first video for magic bums will be on youtube later tonight  i will add the video on fb later when its up  hope you all enjoy it
so who thinks we have school tomorrow?
i am so mad!!!!!!!!!! ugh
life is a party  shouldn't we stop caring and let go of our problems  we need to enjoy the better things in life and stop worring about the little stuff  im bad about this a lot of time  but im growing up and making myself a better person  so im going to party like its my last day on earth  no problems no worries  smile 
hey everyone  i would like anyone that sees this to type in magic bums on fb and like our <propfemale>  thank you
hey everyone  we are trying to get more people to like magic bums  so please type it and and like our <propfemale>  thank you  smile 
"even after all i went through with you somehow my heart has survived  yet i feel sometimes that part of it never came back to me  when i gave you my heart you kept part of it after i was gone  and even tho i will never go back to you, you are still my first love  you got that much of me"
well if i could tell the future i would never tell anyone what will happen  life is a mystery that we try to find out  its like reading the last <propfemale> of a book before you even read the first one  we write our own stories  and we write the ending to that story
"i don't know what happened  but really i don't need to  so many unspoken secrets  lost hopes  broken dreams  lonely nights wishing for a better tomorrow  losing more than just a friend  its all a lesson we must learn one day  people will come and go  and if they go then i have learned that they usually they don't come back  its part of life, love, and forever"
"i am a child waiting for the day to mature into a real honest man  i'm no where near perfect but i know my mistakes  i've moved on a learned the lessons of life  still so much i don't know, but it's a part of growing up  im young but i'm going to try to be the best young man i can be  no one is perfect even if we try to be"
"frozen tears falling down to the earth  covering the world with a white calming snow  all the broken dreams and hearts are so beautiful to us  we watch it fall, we wonder, we see  yet we let it fall forever  we see it and do nothing  we see peoples broken dreams and hearts and do nothing  we need to stop watching the people fall and be there with a helping hand and catch them before they hit the ground"
\i don't mind spending every day\,05b6398b2e9a94394257f63bdc248311,ugh tonight im feeling down  i hate being sad  and i wish people wouldn't make me that way
"the most powerful words are unspoken  words just ruin the meaning of feelings  words can lie, they can hurt, they can kill  unspoken truths are powerful  and no matter what, words are just words  they are meaning less "
haha i don't understand myself  i go from being sad to happy in an hour or so  nothing can keep me down for long i guess lol
the packers are killing the bears so far  i hope the packers and jets go to the super bowl 
if i go a 100 days without you then it makes up for the wasted times i spent with you  i learned that love is a game that i only played  and now i see the errors i made bc i found someone who can do it better than you  and all i say now is the past is the past  and i have a bright future to head into  smile 
deca regionals have been cancelled because of snow  it has been moved to febuary 7th  tell everyone you can
whap homeworks sucks lol
<propfirst> county schools have a one hour delay friday
life is not always the best for anyone  yet we still keep going  it's an up and down ride  but after all we do we are happy sooner or later  and i am happy  i got people around me who catch me when i fall  and i got someone to fight for now  life is just perfect tonight
ugh im in a bad mood tonight  this sucks
"anger is a powerful drug that takes over your body  it controls you and hurts the people around you  if you can't control it then you destroy everything that gets in your way, that includes loved ones  make sure your smart when you get mad and don't take it out on the people around you  love not hate  peace not anger  heal not destroy"
well im going ghost busters tonight lol  back to the haunted hospital to get that ghost  who ya gonna call tonight? <propfirst>!!!!!! lol
haha nothing better than being up at 3 am listening to 3 good looking girls on the phone lol

well i'm watching my baby sister  and she is being good so far  dinner party later on  and idk what else lol
there really is nothing good about goodbye  but sometimes you need to know how it feels to leave and get left  we just need to say goodbye sometimes  and when we do we leave everything behind  there is nothing good about goodbye

"q and a, inbox me"
"q: question why are you so stupid? answer?? \a: wow gabby  umm idk why  your just a crazy sister"
many times in life you have to face things you never thought you would have to  you have to push yourself harder than you ever had to and sometimes you get down and think you can't go on  thats when we look up to the sky to find strength  and thats when we feel his helping hand push us along  thank you god
love is a crazy game we play  and in the end we are usually all losers  but we start again till we find the one that is worth giving a life too  its a crazy game
we all know how pain feels  how it is to be alone when your screaming for help  we all know how hard rock bottom is  but we don't know how to help people  we don't help we break  we destroy and not fix  but we know how bad it feels to be hurt  so why do we hurt others if we know how bad it is??
home is the place that will never leave your heart  you always know where your home is  its the place that when you come back to it memories flood your mind  its your safe heaven from the world  its the place that made you who you are      
"q and a, inbox me"

as the rain falls and the thunder rolls i look back to a time of sunshine and bright blue skies  as the storm rolls over our lives we wish for bright skies and happy sunshine  but with the rain we feel alive  so what about the storm? its what keeps us alive and breathing  it can't be all sunshine and bright skies bc grass can't grow without rain and neither can we
i live a life that is full of the une playful ected  i go through everyday never knowing what will come next  ive been through heaven and hell yet all i want is to see what comes next  i know my past but not my future  and all i can say is here im come world  get ready for me
writing my deca script for state  going to make this the best thing i have ever wrote  state and nationals here we come lol
as i'm writing this i'm looking up into the night sky and i see a different world  the sky has bright stars giving me light tonight  and i look back to my dark past  but the night is my past  and the stars are the light showing through it  so what's this mean for me? i guess it means ive been okay without you  and my past will be morning soon  so you never will cross my mind or heart

\chelsea, chelsea\05b6398b2e9a94394257f63bdc248311,"i live a life full of wonder and mystery  i find happiness in small things, and the big things don't bother me  its all just a game we play  its called life, so play your cards right and watch your dreams come true"
"i made a promise to myself and the world that i will change it  i want a better world that my kids can live in  i would rather die a good man than live as a bad one  its my dream and i hope you want that dream with me  i might not be able to change the world alone, but a million minds can change it for the better"
"i hold the keys to my dreams, my hopes, and my heart  we all hold the key to our futures  and whether we give those keys away is up to us  but before you give it away just ask yourself one question? is the person worth it  "

"question: if you could tell the world one thing what would you say? \i would say time moves fast  and in a blink of an eye your life has passed by  live everyday like the last and enjoy every second of your life because one day it will be gone     love life"
"we all hate for things to end  we see people leave, we see people who die and are gone  we see the world change  and we live through it all  even with the tears we remember those days  \i know now that what goodbye stands for      its just a see you later  smile \everyone is family and nothing can change that  no distance, no ocean, no time will ever change it"
i want to see the world  i want to climb the tallest mountain and swim the longest ocean  there is so much to do in a life time and i want to do it all  i have this life for a reason  and im going to take advantage of it all  i mean we only live once so lets have some fun  smile 
okay im trying to get a group together to go to the vans warped tour on auguest 2nd  if anyone is interested in going please message or comment on this  i need to get an idea of how many people want to go
"we all have someone we depend on  it could be a family member, a friend, or a boy friend or girl friend  but do we ever think we can depend on ourselves? whos the person saying we can keep pushing on? whos the person who when we get kicked down they say stand tall? you want to know who that person is? it's you"
i love how everyone on fb can e playful ress themselves and tell the world what they have to say  its a way for people to break free and let their voice ring
kentucky really needs to stop shooting 3s  they keep missing

i really love my job  gold <propfemale> might not be what a lot of you think of as a good job but the people up there are great  and i love being up there  so i love my job and i get money for doing something i like  pretty great
people come and go  you go through life and see over a million people  and only a few become true friends  i have learned from wiser people than me that if you keep one true friend through your life then your lucky  friends that are true are hard to come by so try being one
haha there is like no one doing anything tonight except for the people going to prom  this is a sucky saturday for anyone who is not going
like this and ill rate you
the good life is watching your dreams come true and having a life that you love  you don't have to be <propmale> and famous to have a good life  the poorest man can be the happiest  it's all in what you do and who you have behind you
"you were my only one  but here i go screaming my lungs out trying to get to you  you are my only one  i let go but there is no one that gets me like you do  you were my only one  \-yellowcard "
someone give me a topic to write about on my next status    first 5 topics i will write a status about
love is a powerful force that can not be destroyed  only time makes it grow stronger  its a bond that can never be broken  and if love is based on a lie then there will always be one broken heart
"its never to late to change the wrongs  its never to late to make amends in your life  nothing is forever but that means that feelings are not forever too  its never to late to fix the broken past  and its never to late to fix a broken future  you just have to try and see the wrongs and mistakes  no one is perfect but it makes a better person out of you if you fix what you broke, because its never to late"
