"why? i notice a lot of people - da, mostly - complain when an artist puts up a picture to support japan  they say that they should be donating rather than drawing  why complain? just like a singer shows their support by writing a song, an artist shows theirs by drawing a picture  it doesn't mean they're not trying anything  it means they want a public way to show their support  so shut up and stop complaining "
