la cerveza mas fina 
indyyyyyyyy! (<propfemale> jones marathon)
"agrees that the fisherman's memorial has great firework acoustics  good friends, too "

stewing

home sweet juneau 
napping 
got a stellar review at work and an early raise!
is teetering 
doesn't feel so lonely now that it turns out the entire state has lost at&t service and not just her  bonus - now the phone is adamant that it is in fact 12 31 1999  turns out time travel isn't so elusive after all 
's combination adrenaline caffeine high is wearing off  uggggh 
is a slug  or at least slug-like  with less energy 
is on the upswing from a stupid chest cold  why do illnesses happen over 3 day weekends?
is amazed by life's hairpin turns 
needs cheering up 
best  homemade dinner  ever 
is thoroughly not amused by the little rebellion her body is staging 
"is emerging from the bed cocoon after 3 very uncomfortable days  alas, she has not transformed into anything remotely butterfly like "

19 more work days for the state and then i am free!
has only a little more than a week left in juneau  how did the time go by so fast!

has only four hours left of driving before getting to stop - at least for a few weeks 
"is appreciative of tulsa's efforts to become more like juneau with excessive rain, but nobody does rain quite like southeast alaska  good effort tulsa, good effort "
"is feeling the kind of melancholy that leads one to think that posting song lyrics as a facebook status is a good idea  don't worry, though - she'll spare you    this time "
is back in detroit    4000+ <propmale> later  smile 
very much appreciates the birthday well wishes and hopes everyone else's july 31st was super swell too!
"finally conquered the travesty that is \relational aesthetics\"" and can move on down the preparatory reading list! here's hoping the next book turns out more readable """
"assisted in razing a wasp metropolis  the dazed survivors are buzzing from ruin to ruin, unable or unwilling to accept their dispossession  thankfully, none have connected us to their calamity  they outnumber us by a lot "
finally booked her flight to iceland london! late september couldn't come too fast 
is getting progressively more nervous that her visa will not arrive in time for her flight  but on the bright side    fresh apple cider doughnuts!
finished (except for a few minor details) her first garment today! this sewing thing is turning out to be pretty cool 
student visa? approved 
is on her way to london!
i like it in the closet 
"never knew how much she appreciated the existence of kinko's until now, being in a situation where she has to print out a form, fill it out, and fax it internationally with some urgency without the foggiest idea where to do it  how does london get by without kinko's?"
"has had pretty much the most frustrating, infuriating, week of her life  i'm not sure what london has against me, but i would really appreciate at least one thing being smooth and easy rather than having to fight over every stupid detail "
"moves into her new wandsworth flat tomorrow morning, barring disaster  knock on wood "
is all moved in!
is feeling really positive about her first two weeks of the master's degree - now to see if i still feel this good about self-directed research for nearly a month and a half   
"wonders: is there an auditory equivalent of \voyeur\""?"""
"saw two plays today - both well done, but one left me thoughtful and amused, the other disgusted and annoyed  i'm really happy to have the opportunity to see plays every night nevertheless, but i almost wish i could have switched the order and ended on a good note  or skipped the second one altogether "
"re: committing to vote - i applied for an absentee ballot - apparently on time, too - but having never tested the mail service from alaska to london and back again, and having not yet received said ballot, i make no guarantees on my vote counting  i will do it, nevertheless! i appreciate everyone's enthusiasm though "
"got her ballot! here's one more for mcadams, heading back across the pond on monday "
"finds it terribly sad that every time it comes up that she's lived in alaska, every single english person brings up <propfemale> palin  without fail "
"finally saw show(s) tonight that made the many (many, many) duds worth it  thanks, belt up theatre company and southwark playhouse - if anyone still has a <propmale> at the triple <propmale>, i say go for it "
"here's to an ine playful licable fireworks show over my house for the walk from the bus stop tonight  i have no idea what we're celebrating, but it lasted exactly the duration of the walk  i could do without the smoke and sulphur smell on the street, though "
is using up her very last emergen-c and hopes her impending cold bug whatever realizes that she means business and gets out of town as a result 
"really entertaining show tonight  surprisingly, because if i had to classify it i'd probably characterize it as a really solid high school show  but very enjoyable nevertheless  how had i never heard of pins and needles before? odd to see it for the first time in london, super cheesy faux 1940s new york accents and all "
"<propmale> river: breathtaking  phenomenal  amazing  it was a pretty empty house, too  i wholeheartedly recommend it, though with the caveat that it was pretty harrowing wrenching  just when i was starting to wonder if my not liking so many shows in fact was pointing to me not liking theatre anymore, it's nice to be reassured that it isn't so "
was reading articles about the possible extinction of redheads  related article? tigers in the wild facing extinction  rawr 
"got a part time job! not a regular one or even a super well paying one, but still! and another interview on saturday!"

"no illusions that my profile picture will have anything whatsoever to do with child abuse, but can't resist a good shout out to captain planet and the planeteers  they just don't make 'em like they used to "
went a little crazy today and bought a cheap pair of roller skates on ebay  my theory is that they will arrive the day the ice returns   
completely exhausted 
"had a flippin wonderful day  productive and saw two shows  salad days may be my new favorite musical  relentlessly charming  and <propfemale> was terribly poignant, touching, and funny  well done all around!"
i find the degree of impunity with which <propmale> mail feels free to leave my packages with neighbors somewhat disconcerting  shouldn't i have to authorize that or something?
"saw a billboard on the train with a woman with shredded paper piled up to her eyes and a caption to the effect of \need a better job? take an office skills class!\"" and was thinking about how much more fun it would be to be immersed in shredded paper professionally than doing data entry  clearly i am not the target market """
"finished audio editing much earlier than e playful ected and decided to treat herself with a trip to the british library to work  pretty all around terrible e playful erience  no actual work was done in the trip, but all kinds of urban alienation feelings to draw on for the project   "
recommended: watching norwegians play music on instruments made of ice inside a makeshift igloo  i bet they'd be a huge hit in juneau   
"was annoyed when student loans were supposed to be deposited friday and they weren't and she was told it would be wednesday at the latest  when it wasn't wednesday, they swore it would be today  now that it's thursday and it is still not there, honest to god first thought? hulk smash "
"spent the better part of the day directing brand new university graduates on where to go when they exited the stage  as boring as the task was, there was something electric about all of their excitement and joy, and it's impossible to help feeling exhilarated, even hours later "
absolutely drained  pretty sure the 14 hour day has kicked the sniffles from maybe nothing to full blown cold status  3 colds in 3 months? i think england is trying to send me a message of unwelcome 
takes back all of those mean things she said about running  more fun than e playful ected 
"what's the thing you don't want to find at home when you don't get home from work until 1am having been out since 10am? oh yeah, drunk, hysterical flatmates  somehow i think i could have done without the reminder "
"thinks this so-called 'winter' in southern england has been damn near utopian in climate  the fact that so many folks are so adept at complaining about the weather nevertheless is a pretty impressive skill - i don't think i could manage it  more winters like this, please!"
"why hello, bizarre dreams  so nice to see you again   "
must spend a significant portion of the walk home from anywhere following along the outer wall of either the cemetery or the prison  this makes for some consistently macabre (yet interesting) trains of thought 
"spent much of the day battling a computer virus  emerged victorious, but could reeeeally use that time back   "
"supremely disappointing evening tonight  i hope you feel better for having written in a <propmale> dark and deep, <propmale> labute, because i certainly don't feel i've gained much by having seen it "
spending some quality time with dvorak  this would not be a problem were it not 12 smile 0 on a school night

so apparently our performance event really is on judgment day  ridiculous  http annoyed  www familyradio com index2 html
will be incredibly grateful when the construction on the building outside the bedroom window is done with for good  chainsaws are not a pleasant alarm clock 
"had a melancholy kind of a day, which was compounded by an ill-advised first viewing of into the wild, prompting one of those 'what am i doing' spirals that ends with me having 10 tabs open on my browser relating to spontaneous life directions i could conceivably pursue, perusal of same punctuated by lots of deep sighing  here's to tuesday being more *actually* productive "
needs a hug
"got to kingston early for work and wandered around a bookshop  apparently if i see a <propfemale> <propfirst> book i am completely unable to resist  this shouldn't be a problem, but i have far too much work to do and i find her books as hard to resist reading as buying "
"accidentally found a job i want that was closing today - study day at the library was hijacked by job application day - got the application in with a whole 2 minutes to spare until it closed  oh well, the british library hadn't any of my requested books anyway   "
would feel a heckuva lot better about the realization process of this event if she didn't keep getting nasty surprises that meant re-doing the same work again and again
