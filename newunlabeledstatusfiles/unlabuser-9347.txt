ice skating friday morning  who wants to come with me?
"<propmale> <propmale> can kick through all 6 degrees of separation, hitting anyone, anywhere, in the face, at any time "
"high fevers, hospitals, ivs, adventures in the bathroom, and <propmale> infections  sums up my day  smile "
i've got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud this is how i do when i think about you
what are you guys doing? looking at pictures of food cz we're hungry
sushi and lots of sleep  fat 
i lost myself in a familiar song i closed my eyes and i slipped away
"all the years thats gone by  all that we've been through  yet now you try to humiliate me  yet now you stab me in the back  i want to know  what is running through your head when you chose to alienize me? what were your feelings when you chose to push aside mine? i want to know  how your heart grew icy and cold  how do you plan to face me now? where do you plan on going from here, <propfemale> <propfemale> hua zhang ?"
a battle fought and won  yet all i am left with is my own anger  drowning in the flames of my fury  all i can do is scream out  yet no one hears my pain and sorrow 
"hope you are happier wherever you are now, elisa-ray <propmale>  you will be remembered "
so i said to angie: i'm gonna slam so hard on my brakes that your gonna choke on my seat belt  wow that sounded dirty 
all you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hands and touch me hold me close don't ever let me go
sleep    wonder if i'll get any of that tonight 
funny how quickly time can fly by   
angel eyes with your angel eyes will you always be there to hold me
standing on the rooftops everybody scream your heart out
and i feel a weakness coming on never felt so good to be so wrong had my heart on lockdown and then you turned me around
speaking to the atmosphere no one's here and i fall into myself
has a vey good feeling about this time around  love 
"there's a warmth inside me, slowly melting my icy heart "

sleep attempt #1 at 2:54am  be at work by 8am  number of hours slept tonight? sadly only a thrid of what i usually get 
hooray for popping new pimples instead of going to bed! sleep attempt number 2   
listen to the waves as they all crash down and watch the fire as it slowly burns away glowing embers fly across the sky
and you'll never fall in love if you don't risk it all
