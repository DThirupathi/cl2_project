"as good as it is to be home, ellensburg sucks  lol   i need trees and mountains, not this cold, <propfemale> desert "
fml
wondering if things are ever gonna change             
anybody else not have anything to do this weekend?? its going to be hell if i'm stuck home for 3 days without something to do or someone to <propfemale> out with 
"anybody have any classes with me next year?\\1- <propmale> w  <propfirst>, famconsumer w  nelson\2- u s  history w  bichierri (spelling?)\3- spanish 2 w  majsterick\4- alg  trig w  keller (2 semester, maybe both   need to talk to mr  botton monday)\5- strength & conditioning w  teasley (pretty sure he's the teacher anyway)\6- jr  lit comp w  birchfield"

"random fact of the day: \    a pussy that draws blood on a friend's little brother is bad "
"random fact of the day annoyed despite popular belief, pink is not a color because it has no wavelength of light "
"i need to quit being nocturnal    maybe if i stay awake as long as possible, when i actually fall asleep i'll sleep during the night  and not all day  wish me luck   "
woke up at 4am cuz i was supposed to work at 5   turns out my boss is sick  so no work today after all  lets try again tomorrow  n_n
is either really tired   or is just having a depressing day  at this point i can't tell 
just had a really odd dream   
"going to vantage to check out a campsite   then my grandparents' for a day or so  too bad they're both a half hour away in different directions  x_x but then, at least its not another 3 hour drive  =|"
"so close, no matter how far\couldn't be much more from the heart\forever trusting who we are\and nothing else matters\\i never opened myself this way\life is ours, we live it our way\all these words i don't just say\and nothing else matters\\yeah, trust i seek and i find in you\every day for us something new\open mind for a different view\and nothing else matters\\nothing else matters - metallica"
"camping was fun, if somewhat different this time around  hahaha  had a freakin blast! nemo and bj   we should do this more often  haha"
who lives in a pineapple under the sea? spongebob squarepants! who died in the ocean because of bp? spongebob squarepants!
if friday the 13th is supposed to be unlucky  then it must've been opposite day too 
[an empty space for my thoughts   maybe i'll fill it in later]
"if you forget to remember what you were supposed to remember to forget, does remembering to forget what you were remembering mean the same thing?"
"has a hollywood undead song stuck in his head   had a fun day hanging with everyone  living life   but isn't really tired, and its past midnight  eh   no clue how i'm gonna be ready to wake up early when school starts   annoyed "
another day away from home   it seems that i've been doing that alot lately   wink 
got a turtle   it's still kinda nameless tho   any suggestions?
"today was better than i would've thought  had a blast hanging with everyone  saw loads of people i haven't seen in forever   yeah, life's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the effort "
"saturday, best day i've had in a while  yesterday, not so much  today, i feel like crawling into bed and sleeping all day  "
"school tomorrow    >_> it's really gonna suck having to get up at 6 smile 0  if i'm not there, i didn't wake up "
is tired    
today was a surprisingly good day   if only everyday was like this  school wouldn't be as annoying at the end of the year   
"gotta love an eventfull day hanging with friends, (kinda) going to a football game, and then a dance afterwards  finally got home at 12 smile 0   the first weekend of the school year is going great!!"
first monday of the school year    not too bad  we'll have to see how the other mondays turn out this year 
huh    i'm way too out of it today   i've been at a loss for what to say and do all day  maybe i'm just tired? idk  v_v
today  tomorrow  the next day  the day after that  you never know whats gonna happen next 
"i keep having the same dream over and over    but, i finally got to sleep in today   smile  lol"
"wow, it's actually down pouring in ellensburg   who would've guessed  it almost feels like home "
"lightning, thunder, and a hella lot of rain  1 word: awesome!"
so my computer's hard drive is officially burned out     gotta love checking fb on the wii  v_v
"and the week is halfway over    everything seems to be falling apart, but then, it hasn't been a bad week, mostly   eh, that's life "
absolutely nothing to do today   -bored-
has anyone else got the random urge to play with fire in the middle of the night? or is it just me?
doesn't have any sarcastic deep random thoughts at the moment  
"so many things to do, and not enough time to do it  just another one of the wonderfull things life throws at you  "
is definately not checking his facebook while he's late for school  [still waiting for a ride  ]
"if you could change the past, would you? even if it meant changing who you are "
"fixed my computer!!  laugh  the only problem, is that it only works when it's laying on its side "
mondays    why must they be so annoying? >_>
"a smiley for each day of the week:    \sunday  playful  monday >_> tuesday  annoyed  wednesday =| thursday  smile  friday  laugh  saturday  laugh "

"so after destroying 3 different civilizations, taking over the mediterranean sea, starting to colonize south <propfemale>, and taking over the aztec maya inca, my game decides to freeze up on me and i lost all of it  >_>\<_<\ troubled  \well that was a waste of 3 hours   stupid computer   playful  v_v"
my computer is acting just like my freaking razor (phone)   >_> it works for maybe 5 minutes and then freezes up  <_< i have to try restarting it for 15 minutes before it works again   troubled  i hate it 
is       still alive  yay again  wink 
"playing guitarhero with <propfirst> and <propmale>   playful  and have a really annoying thought on my mind   v_v i need to do something, anything, about that   "
hmmmm    it seems that not caring about my annoyances in life has made my day better  cool 
"like my status and i'll tell you annoyed 1  something i've learned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds \2  the color you remind me of \3  my first memory of you  \4  the animal you remind me of \5  ask something i've always wondered about you \6  my favorite thing about you \7  give you a weird nickname \8  dare you to repost this?"
"please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone, who needs a smack upside the head  lets raise awareness "
isn't doing anything for holloween  at all  fun 
"has decided that he needs a new profile pic  sadly, he doesn't have any recent photos or a working camera  how sad "
"so i'm home, school was boring as hell, mom went to the hospital    i really don't want to deal with anything right now  eh  i'm walking to 7 11  bye "
"\a word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice \""-bill cosby"""
"filled out an application today and when it said \in case of emergency notify annoyed "" i said \""chuck norris\"" what the hell is my mom gonna do?!"""
"well that wasn't a possibility i was e playful ecting to e playful ect to happen relatively soon    i don't know why tho, i probably should've    not even a month left to decide   what should i do?"
how much wood could a woodchop chop if a wood chop could chop wood?? i've always wondered  
just got a 24pack of mt dew for babysitting my nieghbors kids for a while   score 
the 4 day weekend is almost over   how sad ='(
finally putting new music on my ipod  awesome x]
"is blasting music through the house  lets turn it up even louder, shall we?"
ugh   i hate being stressed out   
i think someone almost burned the house down while i was sleeping   there's tons of smoke in here  no kidding 
"so clever, whatever,\i'm done with these endeavors \alone i walk the winding way \(here i stay)\it's over, no longer,\i feel it growing stronger \i'll live to die another day,\until i fade away "
music is my salvation  
i hate snow  and winter  especially in ellensburg  because there's a ton of snow  and it's cold   troubled 
happy thanksgiving!
wonders about the chaos that would ensue if someone put a reverse button at the top of an escalator 
has lost all motivation  i don't know what to do anymore 
umbreon = awesomeness
really needs a break right now  ugh   
"if toast always lands butter-side down and cats always land on their feet, what would happen if you strapped the toast onto the cat's back and dropped it?"
"stupid facebook won't let me add \sarcasm\"" as one of my languages   >_> bad facebook """
"so, at the threat of being run over (which i'm sure is coming) i've decided to join the number-status thingy craze that people seem to be doing   send a message to me w  a number and i'll write what i think of you in my status "
"#7 you're a cool person and a friend, even if you occasionally threaten to run me over   it's cool how you always threaten to run over people tho (even if you are kidding about it   most the time) lol  and we need to find time to <propfemale> cuz i never see you around anymore "
"just because you finally joined the dark side, does not mean that we have to share our cookies! all we said was that we have them  not that we'd share them "
why is it that every freaking time i try to have a good day somebody or something always has to fuck it up??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"you ever have those days where you just don't give a shit about the world, and feel like wasting your time doing anything other than what you should be doing? yeah  i'm there "
just slept for almost 15 hours on my new couch   that thing is comfy   laugh 
"you know, we grow up taught to believe that everyone's equal  that you are no better than anyone else  of course that's a lie  some are better than others  and those who recognize what makes them better and are able to e playful loit that, are the ones who succeed "
"i'm getting extremely tired of my life  everyday i like it less, and everytime i think about it, i realize i'm runing out of reasons to not give up "
"well it's officially winter break   stoked that i don't have school, but i'm not really looking forward to being at home for 2-1 2 weeks straight  hopefully i'll survive with my sanity intact "
i need something to do 
"if life has you down and out, try licking a power line  you'll be re-energized in no time!"
\i close both locks below the window, i close both blinds and turn away \d6364dc35acff642b47fba41d280c09a,"i gotta say, this christmas is alot better than last year's   laugh "
learning how to play the guitar  just got another one from my mom's friend   laugh

"let us give a moment to remember the millions who have given their lives so we could live today   \\thank you, dinosaurs  we miss you  ),:"
is watching 1000 ways to die  pretty awesome show  haha
sleeping all day was great   but why did i have to wake up? reality sucks  v_v
"my family is just amazing    not  also, annoyed that i missed school 4 out of 5 days this week "
"life is full of twists and turns and we're just along for the ride   let's see where it goes, shall we?"
"dear monday: i despise you  please go away  if you have any questions or concerns, please contact friday  thank you"
"getting better at playing the guitar  learned a couple new songs intros   laugh \on the other hand, my homework isn't done and school has been sucking lately   annoyed  oh well "
"borrowing cod modern warfare for my wii  point, aim, click, and shoot  bye-bye people who are trying to kill me   wink "
i felt the need to post a status  i just don't know what to say  i have a lot on my mind  but i can't say what i'm thinking 
"it's amazing how for every awesome person, every friend, in the world, there's that many more not-so-awesome people  i get the feeling that this is gonna be a long week   "
i fucking hate my life 
"life is like a roller coaster; it's full of ups and downs, and sometimes you just have to hold on for dear life  "
"i try to make it through my life, in my way, there's you \i try to make it through these lies, that's all i do \\just don't deny it,\don't try to fight this,\and deal with it,\and that's just part of it   "
filling out the first of many applications  still need a personal contact  and does anybody know anywhere that's hiring?
my rollercoaster broke down at the bottom of it's track and all the engineers are taking a lunchbreak  stay tuned for further developments 
home alone for the week  everybody should randomly show up at my place tomorrow and we'll order a pizza or something!! lol
bonfire was awesome  now to watch the hangover and stay up all night  good times   laugh 
one of my guitar strings broke  sad  sad day  time to take out my spare guitar  
what's worse? saying something and regretting it; or not saying something at all when you had the <propmale> to   
"it's friday   1:20 in the morning and i'm wide awake   fml  hopefully today will be a good day  but knowing my luck, it probably won't "
spring break = no school!  smile  but a week at home with my family and nothing to do   ? not looking forward to that 
are things going to get even better? or are they fine just how they are? i want things to improve but then i don't wanna risk what i already have  -sigh- that's life 
"u s  military members are somewhere in the world tonight missing their family while you are safe at home  in the minute it takes you to read this, military members all over the world are not only saving lives, but also sacrificing their own life for your freedom  it's military appreciation week  re-post if you are in the military, love a military member, or appreciate our troops "
"the only thing in life that you absolutely have to do, is die  everything else is negotiable "
"dear monday annoyed      why must you hate me so much? the only good thing about you is that i only see you once a week, and even that's more often then i'd like to  well here goes nothing    off to school i go  you better behave yourself today  x_x\from logan\p s  please tell the weekend that we need to chill more often, thank you "
let's see how creative my facebook friends are      leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the fourth letter of your last name     it can only be 1 word      then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you      don't just post a word & not copy       that's no fun! go repost this and see what you get 
feels like just crawling into bed and staying there for a week    or a month    or a year     annoyed 
"each day is a new day  but the more things change, the more things stay the same  and that's how the cookie crumbles "
