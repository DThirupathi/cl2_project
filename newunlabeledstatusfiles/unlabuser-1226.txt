"i\ should delete my facebook account  i mean, it's totally useless  it's \not making me friends or  helping my communication, nobody has ever \posted on my wall of their  own accord, and nobody i actually want to \talk to is ever online or  has any free time  or would talk to me before\ others anyway "
"i have to  travel the world and find just one person who\ would rather talk to me  beyond anyone else  but that would be hopeless\  annoyed  probably only 1% of  humans would converse with me, and \probably 0 0001% really share my  interests   (see previous part it was too long)"
i really miss <propfemale> and mariya   they were the only girls who were ever nice to me of their own accord 
"i am very sad  it's partially my life but it's mostly because of the thing which we do not understand at this age  i honestly don't think i will be understood until we are all older and more thoughtful in certain aspects, but time crushes dreams and some dreams move like jello already "
