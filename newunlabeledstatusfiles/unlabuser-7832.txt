"i am the gummy bear <propmale> and <propfemale> <propfemale> is my <propfemale>   playful  (no, i'm not marrying her)"
can't wait till my tilly dearest comes to visit 
welcome to 2011  lets hope for the best in this new year 
love is friendship set on fire 
i'm pretty sure if anyone could read mine and mikaylas minds they'd be scared  oh and this new year has gotten off to an amazing start  now i know that this is going to be an amazing year 
i dislike facebook  it's lame 
coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooww
"to often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring  all of which have the potential to turn life around  so take everything in the best way you can  don't turn down the ones you love for the ones you want  because sometimes we just don't get what we want  but, we'll always want what we can't have "
so bored with school  its like nothing ever happens here anymore  what a bummer 
"ready for school to end  theres only about 20 days left  so its okay but, the weather needs to warm up  and fast "
i kind of want to do online school full time  for next year  do you think that would be a good idea?
it's almost been a year since i'v lived in utah   annoyed 
be everything you've ever dreamed of  be the person you want to see  be yourself above all other things 
"nine more days left of school  seriously, i can't wait for summer  it's going to be great  except for the fact that i'll be in utah  i use to love going on vacation then going back to oregon "
the kids at my school are like scared little animal  as if their scared to be themselves  ever wonder why they don't talk to me? well there you go 
today has been a really good day so far  lets hope it stays that way   smile 
"where i'm at right now, i don't have tolerance for something stupid, or hatred, or envy  if your bringing anyone of those things how 'bout you leave me alone "
do i really look that old? i just got asked if i was a senior 
i have learned to always make sure i'm logged out of facebook on my mom's computer before i leave  or else she posts random stuff on people status  thanks a lot mom   playful

"mom- eventually you will read this, i want a camcorder so that i can record my life  because that would be so neat  but, i'm probably going to tell you this when i see you tomorrow  so this was just pointless "
i love looking at old photo's of when everyone was little  it really makes you miss the old days though 
"so today, i was calld by hot topic and offered an interveiw  but the problem is that im going to be gone most of the summer  they're looking for summer help  hopfully i'll get another interveiw either from there or somewhere else later in the year "
singing to the radio and driving yhrougb the coutry is the best  i want to get a baby black sheep and put a bow around its neck  c:

"took out my extensions tonight, so i'm back to 'shortish' hair  i will not do though's kind of extensions again  and mikayla keeps making fun of how i type!"
"my touch screen on my phone is not working at all  all i can do is call my house phone and thats it  i need to get it fixed but, i have no way to get to the at&t store "
getting ready to go camping  it's so cute how excited <propfemale> is  no phone till tuesday though

"\pretty smiles and make-up hide so much these days \"""""
finally getting to that online school i've been putting off for no reason  can't finish my drivers <propmale> class yet though  stupid test won't let me move past the first question 
"uhm, windows live messenger  just signed up for it  maleiarainbow@hotmail com"
"i actually want to do my homework now  has the world turned around? i think not, looks like it's just me "
i've decided that <propmale> will go see step up 3 with me weather he likes it or not

"people in utah dress their children very oddly  reminds me of thing girl i knew in oregon  oh, my!"
thank you kyrsten 
why do we have eyebrows?
driving test put off again  why can't people ever just help me out  i guess this means more driving time  so close to making an appointment with the dmv though 
"i want to go to beddd   \so sleepy "
i hate when people use the word 'fracking'  it's so irritating and sounds idiotic 
i don't understand the whole 'i'm best friends with my teacher' concept and the 'i text my teacher everyday ' it's just so odd to me  we never had kids like that in oregon 
i think this is the earliest ive ever been up on a saturday 
i'd appreciate if i would stop being told to look and be someone else  because fact of the matter is that i don't look the same as i did in 7th grade and i'm not the same person  i love the way i look and i'm more confident  if you don't like it then i don't think we can be friends 
i passed my road test!
"yessss, long lunch today  im so tired "
"to my two daughters <propfemale> <propmale> and kyrsten <propfemale>, i love you two sweet dreams!"
