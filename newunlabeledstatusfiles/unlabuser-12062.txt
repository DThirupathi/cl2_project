"had something of an adventure last night with my best friend, and is just now getting up  we went to eat dinner, and it was great! then, we went to a place that we thought would be a nice little jazz club, but turned out to be a ritzy restaurant  then we got lost in <propmale> trying to find a real jazz club   and eventually gave up, came home and watched a movie  attempt to be spontaneous? fail! but in a fun way   smile "

"everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and they donâ€™t hold grudges  they understand that life is busyâ€¦but you will always love them  repost if you have at least 1 of these friends, they will know who they are! ?"
