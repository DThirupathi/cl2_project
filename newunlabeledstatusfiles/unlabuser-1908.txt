"da%n cars! can't go to the gym this morning, gas tank strap broke on my car, just as <propmale> was backing it into the driveway (i had him drive it to see what the noise was!!!) so today, i get to be driven to work and picked up     ugh!! but it could be worse, it could have broken when i drove to owego, or when we go to vt on friday   "
wants her car back!
"okay, so i have my car back   but only one side of the gas tank part came in (strap) <propmale> checked the other side and it is loose, so while i can drive, my car needs to go back on the lift at <propmale>'s and get the other side done before it indeed breaks  since there was a mix-up and only one strap was sent, i can't go to vt on friday  sad     <propmale> also has a check engine light on, so basically we could be vehicle less   "
"going to the magic paintbrush to learn some more, to see <propfemale>(!), to have lunch and to all and all enjoy myself in the wonderful world of magic!"
