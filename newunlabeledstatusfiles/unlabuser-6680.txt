"has a bowl of ice cream, brownies, cherries, whipped cream, chocolate syrup and chocolate chips in front of him thats roughly the size of a kid size soccer ball  need i say more?"
it better be time for chocolate pretty soon here or else something is going to get smashed 
"kinda wishes his bow would do what he wanted it to now and then  once every couple of days might be nice, maybe occasionally doing something with a french or italian sounding name like 'sautille' or 'saltando' or even 'pomme de terre'  it would also be helpful if his fingers would hit the same spot on the string more than once, preferably not due to accident  but i dream "
"wow  interlochen thinks my middle name is willilam  its on my id  and every piece of interlochen mail thats been addressed to me according to my parents  i knew my handwriting was pretty grotesque, but i thought i did a good job on the paperwork this year    "
