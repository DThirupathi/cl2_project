life's what you make of it   
just saw the social network  i guess every great invention has a great story behind it 
forgot his cellphone at home  it's kinda nice actually 
so much to do so little time
it's easier to study ochem than physics    cause i'm not as scared of my physics professor 
how would you define me?
"i got a 100% on my physics test!!! i'm the only one in the class that did, whoop!"
"last night, i didn't go to a concert with one of my favorite bands, i didn't go to a party for my work, i didn't go smoke hooka with one of my best friends    i did work on an essay   "
