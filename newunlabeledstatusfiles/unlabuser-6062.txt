"still can't sleep, eat, or think about anything else  i feel a migraine coming on  iv tried my best to treat her right and to be without her feels so wrong"
never got any sleep still can't eat  today feels like a nightmare from which i will  not awake  i'm not sure how much more i can take
still in a dream  at least now iv hurt enough to feel numb 
still a mess but i have to go to work later  i need some prayers to pull myself together  i still love u <propfemale>    
"romans 10:9-13 love must be sincere  hate what is evil;cling to what is good  be devoted to one another in brotherly love  honor one another above yourselves  never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor serving the lord  be joyful in hope, patient in affliction,faithful in prayer "
o yea almost forgot i'm moving back to burkesville wednesday
i'm getting a little better  i can hold a little food down but trying to sleep in this bed without her is giving me nightmares  she won't take me back     i'm sure of it now  i had everything i wanted just by being with her but now that i'm nothing i can remake myself into whatever i want : )
"romans 14:8 if we live, we live to the lord and if we die, we die to the lord  so whether we live or die we belong to the lord "
what's on my mind? the future 
can't stop dreaming about her    
iv been trying so hard to ignore this feeling but the truth is i'm still just as in love 
thank god for answered prayers  if i wasn't getting up around 4 then i believe i would get the best night of sleep iv had in awhile  its nice having your faith rewarded when u hear a prayer answered  it may not be the answer u prayed for but u know its the right one 
moving in the morning
about to start movin to b ville

feeling like i'm backed up in a corner  how much do i have to go through before u can catch a break

just had an amazing dream of a past memory 
"you and me are the perfect team, when were together its like a dream u make me smile and i make u wild  when im with u i feel like a child   because i become easy to please, but remember please don't tease  u love me or love me not, u stole cupids automatic and me u shot "
not sure of anything anymore  i'm so damn confused  its amazing how fast things can turn on u 
at the sawmill watchin the ufc ppv  thinkin of how much fun i had with her today 
can't believe <propmale> lost   
i'd do anything under this sun to get back what iv lost  this week would have been perfect if it wasn't for last night  idk whats gonna happen but either way ill never be the same    never take what time u get with someone for granted 
"ill do whatever it takes  when i'm with you i get the shakes  my body aches when i aint with you i have zero strength  there's no limit on how far i would go no boundaries no lengths why do we say that till we get that person we thinks,gonna be the one then once we get em its never the same  u want em when they don't want u"
i wasn't looking when i stumbled on to you must have been fate but so much is at stake  what the fuck does it take let's cut to the <propmale> before the door shuts in your face  promise me if i cave in and break that i won't be makin a mistake
just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a <propfemale>    
"i'm the logo on the <propfirst> cowboy helmet \the <propfemale>, i'm not giving up til i get my respect, and i wont stop til i get enough,\cuz i'm not livin up to my own e playful ectations"
i'm stronger than you know   
i'm an idiot to think for a second that    
when i think i'm strong u make me weak       
high off of love drunk from the hate its like i'm huffin paint and i love it the more i suffer  i suffocate then right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates  me she fuckin hates me and i love it
