maybe i did mess up  maybe it is my fault  all i know is i can't stop thinking about him 
crying myself to sleep again 
feeling a little better but still broken to a point  it took me a two years to get what i wanted and one day to tear it all apart and find myself so low i don't feel like getting up  but it's getting better  i admit i still hurt a lot but i'm managging to bury it nicely  *sighs* life goes on  even if i be left behind by it  best get up and start moving again 
totally feeling screwed over  people trying to push for what they want and it's not what i want  i won't make it to graduate this year in may so i'll do it in the fall  i let a lot of people down  i pray mom didn't put the money in for the cap and gowned  if she did it's a waste of her money that could be put towards food 
wondering if it's all worth it and which path i should take  i just don't know anymore  wondering if i'm even gonna make bowling tomorrow 
well over the weekend my brothers girlfriend was over and she was sick so guess what???? i'm sick too!!!!! so dang happy!lol
still sick but getting better  running on tired as all get out right now and yet i still have lots to do  i miss him like no other  life goes on and i keep on too 
i'm gonna hate the summer  i'll never get to see you and i'm going to be very sad and alone   i just wanna be with you more than anything  gues what i want and what i get are two very different things at this point  oh well i guess you've got to lose to win huh? i miss you      
trying to keep from thinking and feeling  cause all i feel is hurt and destoryed  nothing but tears  i'd rather feel nothing at all  just be completely blank  no feeling no attachment just nothing 
the numb finally came last night  not sure i want to go back to feeling  cause if i do i know it will mean going back to being sad again  i don't want to be sad again  i'd rather fake a smile than have to cry 
holy hera do my fingers hurt today
