stress emotionally and physically doesnt do me justice          
the movie legion is 100% against god          
tired of life and to tired to care about the problem

"\we get so much in the habit of wearing disguises before others that we finally appear disguised before ourselves\""     i am so confused about many things right now     this is me    """
i am coming to know the truth in many things lately      
    to tired to want to deal with anything anymore     its a friday    
hhuumm     pepper <propfirst>  cheese-its are amazing!    
life can be so cruel even to the most innocent    
what would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?
i miss all my friends from home and church!    
omgness     its so cold     where did all the heat go?    
"spiritually, mentally, physically drained     or plainly i'm sick and it hurts    "
"courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear"
getting really tired     of fake friendships    
i'm finding that not all who wonder are lost      
what is it with peoples view on beauty    
nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets
wow looks like i'm not getting a break from being sick  
"no one who hides behind closed doors are free, for they are imprisoned by their own fear        "
"isn't is ironic? we ignore those who adore us, adore those who ignore us, love those who hurt us, & hurt those who love us?"
how is the world did i get here?    
going home for the weekend!     finally get to relax    
"i'm finding that moving on is simple, what you leave behind that makes it difficult"
having to wake up to reality     no time to dream anymore    
mid-term testing coming already     so not cool    
coming down to a couple of hard choices      
it's going to be a long weekend        
i'm finding that stress is the confusion created when one's mind overrides the body's basic <propfemale> to choke the living daylights out of some jerk who desperately deserves it  
it really sux when you lose or are about to lose someone close to you    it hurts    
sux when you are so tired and it takes all your energy to get to class to find it cancelled  lol  owell  
"i am finding that if you see the magic in a <propfemale> tale, you can face the future"
i am finding that fear is god's warning signal to get busy          
will i ever see what you could see in me?
i'm done pretending     done sitting on the side lines of life    
why do classes have to start on a monday?    
thank god     i am passing all my classes     so stress free now      wink     
"it is not love that is blind, but jealousy; which ends up hurting the ones you love    "
to think a car reck can make one feel so sore  agh  
doesnt anyone live an original life? what did you surrender to be on the in crowd?
"i wonder what its like to have it all, to never be afraid that i would fall    "
going to the doctor's tomorrow  pray they dont find anything wrong  
results from yesterday: concussion and very bad body pains      
x-ray and ct scan results: positive for no damage     thank the lord    
if head aches increase the next step will be a mri scan  hope that doesnt happen  
i see that the key to change is to let go of all my fears      
i gaze out a darkened window to a broken sky      
who wants to plant a pizza plant?      
i am finding that <propmale> is the only way to run away without leaving home
i'm ready to be done with everything     and just escape    
r i p  is the only way to really get any sleep now days   
i found that if you lose yourself your courage soon will follow  so be strong   
i'm finding that you might be done with <propmale> but <propmale> is never done with you    
   love   i would risk you hating me as long as in the end i know i still love you   love   
i live  because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help    
"i'm thinking that perhaps our eyes need to be washed by tears now and then, so that we can see life more clearly again  "
though the world may think im losing touch with reality  it would be crazy to choose this world over eternity  
maybe all we need to do is stop planning our lives and start living them   
"omgness   tofurky and gravy soda, the new jones sodas  ummm  how about eeewww   sounds gross   "
if everything around us is beautiful than why do we find a need to change it?  
i have no clue what to say or think      
looks like in the end i am right     even if they say its not true i know it is     its proven    
i hope that what seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings that are hidden at first   
sux when you have friends and know they are lying to you and dont care   
going to have to face my past and present when writing my english paper  wish me luck  
this is going to be a long weekend  fun fun  
if i am so good at helping ppl why cant i help myself?   
"if we are the generation of change, then why do we tare down those trying to change the world for the better?  "
"to the unloving, the unfaithful, the hurting, the dreamless, the ungreatful, the unwanted  i love you  "
i'm finding that <propmale> is our senses on fire fueled by imagination  
what in the world is going on  sick then not then sick again  agh  
"to me the smartest people are those who fight, get beat, rise, and fight again  "
nothing ever happens the same way twice   
i hope everyone has a great break and safe trips  will miss you all  l8er  
so glad to be home and hanging with old friends again  
sickness never takes a break       owell      
"i'm finding that when we doubt our abilities and who we are, we give power to our doubt  "
2012 is not to bad of a movie but not what i thought it to be like  still good  
my heart is missing people that left and it will never stop loving them   
i feel more alive then i have for the past 3 year   
i have a new look on things and a new cell phone  
after what i have heard i can work to be at peace with a big part of my past    smile    
my life is great!!!!!  love 
"i feel a strong urge to join my friends and jump from 15,000 feet  "
going to have to face something i am hoping isnt the answer   
<propfirst> <propmale> concert was the best that i have ever gone to see!!!  wink    
im am coming down to a choice idk if my heart can bare   
"you call my name, i come to you in broken pieces, so you can make me whole   "
time going by way to fast  need time to slow things down  
"let it snow, let it snow, let it snow      "
keeping hope and taking things slowly  trusting instead of relying on fear  
want more snow just minus the cold  lol  
things happen for the better of us and not the worse  hold onto that hope  
i was doing homework and ended on facebook   
im finding that there will be many friends that walk in and out of my life but only the true friends will leave their footprints behind  
"lol  is most commonly used when we run out of things of importance to say or have nothing else to say on im, text, or anything else for that matter  "
had an interesting and fun time last night  
i'm looking for an internship to take <propmale> classes in japan  
"im either moving to california, new york, florida, japan, or germany in the next couple of years  more likely japan though  "
i think this will be my last year at tech  i am for some reason on fire to trasnfer and go to japan  
one more left

"the 23 flavors of dr  pepper: -amaretto, almond -blackberry, black licorice -carrot, clove -<propfemale>, <propfemale> -cola, <propfemale> -juniper, lemon -molasses, nutmeg -orange, prune -plume, pepper -root beer, rum  -raspberry, tomato -vanilla    i'm surprized alot about wuts in it  wow  "
is tired of ppl telling others to do as they wish and wut they believe is right  then they condem them for doing it and treat them like crap  
"lord i lift my friends to you, i've done all that i know to do, i lift my friends to you complicated circumstances have clouded their view, and i fear that i wonâ€™t have the words that they need to hear  i pray for your wisdom, oh god and a heart that's sincere, and lord i lift my friends up to you  lord i lift my friends to you my best friends in the world, i know they mean much more to you  i lift my friends to you "
i have not been called to the wisdom of this world but to a god calling out to me and even though the world make think im losing touch with reality it would be crazy to choose this world over eternity  
why do we hurt the ones trying to change the world when we encourage them to be a light to the world?  just shows wut a lifeless world we really are  
it hurts when some people assume things about people around them when they dont know wuts going on then say things that hurts those people before they even try to understand  really hurts  
i think i am in heaven  3-d animation is like so amazing  yay me  lol  
wuts it going to take to make people see my reflection isnt really a work of beauty?  
i wonder what it's like to have it all to never be afraid that i would fall  
doesn't anyone here live an original life?  or did you surrender to be on the inside?  
there is just no winning when it comes to some friends     but i love you all anyway with a full heart      
this weekend just crashed and became pointless    
i don't wanna be afraid     i wanna wake up feeling beautiful     yea like that will happen      sad      
in the race to be better or best do not miss the joy of simply being        joyful

"i shall call him squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my squishy  come on, squishy come on, little squishy  "
what really bothers me is people who look down on others who struggle with learning  just because they struggle with learning doesnt mean they are any less of a person  so love me for me or dont love me  because what you see is what you get    wink   
it hurts me when i see people hurting others who try to make a difference  thought we wanted a world of positive change?  isnt that why we encourage people for a better world?  
"to all those who are lost, hurting, and alone  i love you   even if i might not know you  you always have me as your friend  so <propfemale> in there you'll live to see a brighter day  let me know if you guys need anything    joyful    "
