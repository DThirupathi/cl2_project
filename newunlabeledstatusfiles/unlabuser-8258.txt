"i had that happen once  they were looking for someone else, but wouldn't leave there name  i called back a few minutes later and it was the police dept  in arizona! lol"
"a men to that  it's really a shame that in 2 generations <propfemale> as a whole has gone from country first to to hell with it, i'll just <propfemale> somebody "
"i have that wild hair up my ass, so i'll be sorting out pics and getting them on here "
"i lost a friend yesterday  <propmale> colonsalo was involved in a car vs motorcycle accident the day befor the run for the wall riders arrived  <propmale> was very active in the american legion, alr and kansas patriot guard  i just hope those 4 teenage girls realize the lost the rest of us share "
"hey everyone, as noticed, i cannot type or at least in this case spell lol"
"it seems that the point has come in my daughters life where based on her extensive e playful erience in life, that she is no longer wanting or needing to follow my advice  on a lighter note  thanks for all the birthday wishes what happened to the days when we were young  we weren't ever supposed to get this old "
fine!!! all of you can be that way  but just because today is my birthdat does not mean i am any older sothhhhppppppp
"if you received a birthday request and i already have it, that's just the memory thing again  sorry"
be ashamed if you die before you do something good for your country
"before the meeting, two military officials said mcchrystal went in prepared to submit his resignation  they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly   and we let these people hold top secret security clearances?"
"yeah, but that's only if you want to be successful  you can pussy-foot and piddle around for years and not get any farther than you are now  i think it is going to take a full generation to change their ways of thinking about us "
"oops, sorry walt, i hit the y instead"
hey <propfirst>  thanks for having a <propmale> to bs with you this weekend  we are going to have to make it a habit of sorts 
hey <propfirst>  are we still good for friday evening? it'll be around 9ish when i get there 
"i still don't know if i'll come down this christmas  if i do, i'll tow the bike down so i can ride down there  just think, witha car, i can finally get my sword out of my mom's house"
hey <propmale>  just how long are you going to stay over there?
"i was just looking at google maps of ft  myers  all the different places i lived, the schools, even the road names  people say that the <propfemale> years are late in life  i think it's just the opposite  whe didn't have a care in the world other than making it home for dinner  we didn't have to worry about retirement accounts or saving for college or even providing for our family "
"well, only 4 more weeks till i head off to sturgis  it'll be my first time there and it happens to be the 70th anniversary  i'm thinking it's going to be busy! lol  does anyone want me to pick up  anything for them? understand though,, i'm on a bike "
dont you just hate when that happens
2 weeks and i head out to visit <propfirst> and then off to sturgis!!
"well, tomorrow i head out to <propfirst>'s house in hopes that we can toss some testoserone around by bsing  from there i'll head out monday morning for sturgis for a week  short trip, long trip,rain or shine, it's me and the bike  ok with about 250,000 to 500,000 other riders, but there are lots of roads cutting through the black hills  sometimes simply the rushing of the wind is the best companion you can find "
"well, i made it back from sturgis  i'll be posting some pictures in the adventures album  i hope you visit it "
"well, i thought when i got back the last time that i was going to retire in ft <propfirst>, wa (seattle)  14 months after i got there the army sent me to ft <propmale>, ks  if you know where kc is, the state of kansas is a small suburb to the west  lol  anyway, so i ended up retiring here and work for northrop grumman (defence contractor)"
"people can't think that kansas is in the middle of nowhere, they have to think of it as--you are already halfway to where you do want to go  tell your son for me that i say thank you for what he does  seriously, please let him know i said that  i'm pretty heavy into motorcycling now  my oldest daughter and i went on a 6300 mile trip last year  had a blast  look at me, jaw jacking again  lol"
"yeah, i sent it straight to <propfirst> too! lol"
the point is covered up if you have a hat on! what's up?
"ok here  i need everyone to get thinking for me  the lord knows i have trouble doing it myself  i need eveyone to concentrate and think: buy christmas cards, buy christmas cards  just as a warning, we might be going through this same drill tomorrow morning with: fill cards out  i just thought i should let you know! lol"
"well, guess what? thanks to those subtle hints and sharp elbows, i remembered to stop by <propmale> would on my way back home from topeka  hey <propmale>, the step by step was great but knowing that i was a ssoldier, you could have numbered them! lol"
"all in all, i agree that if you ignore the phelps clan that they will eventually go away  so you think! every single day that these people or any other group of what our society has deemed extreme know they can say what they want when they want to who they want is empowering them even more  when are we going to draw the line in the sand and then have the guts and determination to do what we said we would do "
"it's a great lesson to teach our kids! be a pacifist and don't say anything to\offend someone just because they have offended you countless times  it's\amazing how one preacher in the united states talks about burning a quran\and draws responses from as high as the united states of <propfemale>, yet we\don't say a damn thing about burning our own bibles or flags "
"the more we let these people do the things they do, it will become second nature \afterwards it will become law  then the next step comes in and the process starts all over again  we as <propfemale>ns better wake the he%l up  it's a good thing that the people that were in the <propfemale>n revolution didn't think like we do, because there wouldn't be an <propfemale> "
"england has drawn that line in the sand  they have a list of 21 groups or people that are not allowed in their country because they are known hate groups  everything it seems comes down to the first amendment  right, keep thinking that  if i egg a persons\house all i am doing is e playful ressing myself which is allowed and protected under the constitution "
"get ready <propfemale>, because in about 30 years there won't be a united states of <propfemale> at the rate we are going "
"to all my friends, co-workers, kids of friends alike  i hope you have a very <propfemale> christmas and enjoy the season that brings people together like no other  i don't make my rounds very well (saying hi and sorts) but please know that i think of all of you often for it is your combined influences that have made me who i am "
first snow of the year  hanging around 18 degrees right now
"sir, though i wasn't afforded the opportunity to know you as a person, i very much know you as a persona  i studied ww ii in my early days as a youth  i have served our country as you did under the same banner known as 'old <propfemale>'  i'm sure that a lesser man would have found it increasingly difficult to remain as modest as you  i served with a man in desert storm "
"as talbert said that he would follow you into hell, i have said that about 'my' lt winters  his name is ltc(r) <propfirst> a  nagl  it is amazing that such a horrible thing such as war can bring men together like no other  your band of brothers is just as much alive today as it was 60 years ago  men like you are very rare indeed  know that this earth is a lesser place without you in it  sincerely, <propfirst> e  kebbel sfc(r)"
gruss gott alle
