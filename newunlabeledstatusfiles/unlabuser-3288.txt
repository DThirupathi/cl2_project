"is letting go of her dream to have good, healthy relationships with certain people  i can't allow myself to dwell on the sad fact that i am the only one trying  i'm just going to focus on the positive: the people that are always true to me    my baby, my love, and a few wonderful friends who always have my back  ya'll know who you are!"
"has shampooed the carpets, changed all the bedsheets, washed, folded, and put away all the clothes, gave the sofa a good cleaning, dusted the whole house, and a whole lot more  im trying to give the whole house a really good cleaning before the semester starts  im totally drained but it was so worth it!"
has been playing hard with <propfirst> at <propfemale>'s house! my little energizer <propfemale> never runs out of energy!!
"a man is but the product of his thoughts: what he thinks, he becomes "
"be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle "
every accomplishment starts with the decision to try

thinks tonight shall be an abita night  i also think i took on way too much this semester     but nothing i can't handle  my to do list is only like 20 pages long  better to be busy and productive than idle and lazy!
is it thursday already? where did this week go?!
i can't change the direction of the wind but i can always adjust my sails to reach my destination!
"loves that when she put on her jeans this morning they were way too loose! working out everyday for the last month has paid off! i lost some fat, gained some muscle, have more energy, and feel much stronger!"

"so would any of my lovely facebook friends do me a huge favor? i am finished up a paper tonight that's worth 20% of my grade  i hate turning in a paper without having another perspective  if one of you will be willing to proofread and give me some feedback, you'd have my undying gratitude!  smile  i didn't have time to finish it this week, otherwise i'd have brought it to the writing center "
having a positive mental attitude is asking how something can be done rather than saying it can't be done 
"keep your dreams alive  understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication  remember all things are possible for those who believe "
the only thing that will stop you from fulfilling your dreams is you 
"has decided to register for the new orleans jazz half marathon in october!! training starts in one week! â€œkeep your dreams alive  understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication  remember all things are possible for those who believe â€�"

"one day at a time - this is enough  do not look back and grieve over the past for it is gone, and do not be troubled about the future, for it has not yet come  live in the present and make it so beautiful it will be worth remembering!"
"can handle when things don't go my way for the most part, but when things really don't aren't working out as planned i get annoyed  no sense on sulking though  gotta make the best of it! playing with <propfirst> all day tomorrow  forget my other responsibilites for a day! just me and my boy tomorrow!  smile "
is enjoying this beautiful morning outside playing with little man!
"is having a blast with <propfirst> today! we've played soccer, taken a walk to the pond to feed the ducks and turtles, played with doodle bugs, colored, finger painted, wrestled, had tickle fights, built a fort, sang and danced, made newspaper hats, picked flowers and so much more! it feels good to let go of everything else for a day and just play!"
is sitting outside on the back porch in the shade with <propfirst>  it's cooler out here than in the apartment  the ac has been out all day  i called and reported it early this morning and still nothing  the worst part is <propfirst> wanting to run and play but if he can't cool off his eczema may flare up   sad 
yay! someone is finally here to fix the ac!
is playing in the rain with <propfirst>   smile 
it is beautiful outside today! i wish class could be held outdoors!  smile  more class then work! have a great day everyone!
got stung by a caterpillar who snuck into my bag this morning at school and my hand is still burning! other than that today has been good! lots of work left to do tonight once little man is in bed though 
"is so so sore  three <propmale> yesterday and 30 minutes of cardio followed by an hour on intense strength training today did me in! tomorrow will be a rest day for sure  â€œdream as if you'll live forever, live as if you'll die today â€�"

it's never too late to become what you might have been 
really thought we were long past sleep  deprivation due to <propfirst>  out of nowhere he is refusing  to stay in his bed  im so tired!
is completely drained  i'm really hoping i can make it through finals without going insane! three weeks! just keep swimming     
"please pray, hope, send your positive thoughts, or whatever it is you do that my little man sleeps tonight! i don't know if i can make it tomorrow on two hours of sleep again! have a great night everyone!"
"bedtime battle: mommy - 1, <propfirst> - 0   smile   classes work  have a great day friends!"
"the only one who can tell you \you can't\"" is you  and you don't have to listen """
â€œi have heard there are troubles of more than one kind  some come from ahead and some come from behind  but i've bought a big bat  i'm all ready you see  now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!â€� - dr  seuss   smile 
"whether i fail or succeed shall be no man's doing but my own  i am the force; i can clear any obstacle before me or i can be lost in the maze  my choice; my responsibility; win or lose, only i hold the keys to my <propfemale>"
had a great weekend  <propfirst>'s reaction to all the great stuff the easter <propfemale> brought him was priceless   smile  cooking some smothered pork chops with black eyed peas and rice and relaxing  may have a glass of wine or two 
got in a great workout today and got some steaks marinating in the fridge for tonight!  love 
"obstacles don't have to stop you  if you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up  figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it "
"thought it to be a beautiful day for a run so that's what i did! that was the most intense 2 <propmale> ever due to the wind working against me and trying  to throw me around,  but it's all good! feeling good  going get some schoolwork done before i pick up the little man  have a great day friends!"
"cooked some spaghetti squash with primavera sauce loaded with zucchini, mushrooms, green peppers, carrots, and garlic and it is delish!  smile  <propfirst>'s loving it! i'm so happy my little man loves healthy food like his mommy!"
"had a very interesting and rather enlightening day  \act as if what you do makes a difference   it does \"""""
literally doesn't have enough time to do everything she needs to do this week! unless i don't sleep at all something will suffer  i can't wait until finals are over and done with 
is so happy that my accounting final is over and done with! 6 straight hours of studying taking the exam has given me a migrane  one more week of hell until the semester is over!
