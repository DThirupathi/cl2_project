we are heading out to the lake 
<propfemale> had a fun time at the library today she made friends with another little girl her age  she'll have more oppurtunity with us moving to daybreak where there are a lot more children her age 
walking through the store was difficult tonight i kept looking at all the sweets and the chips  i just had to keep thinking i've lost 11lbs so far and to just keep it up 
fun day we went to the lake again and i paddled more wondering if i'm going to be sore tomorrow 
found out yesterday <propfemale> has two cavities  sad  but at least we find a good dentist closer to where we are going to live 
dd is finally taking a nap
just came home from costco and visiting our small aquariam 
"is walking to the mail box so <propfemale> can mail her letter to \papa\"" """
wondering what to make for dinner
tried a new dish tonight delicious 
we had a good day at church and now it's nap time 
stupid driver award for today: we were on our way home from church and i looked over and saw a driver going 60mph (posted speed limit) using one hand to talk on the cell and the other to drink from a starbucks (cold) cup 
"i can't believe i'm about to hand out another stupid driving award today  today i look over and see a woman talking on her cell using one hand and on the other she was text messaging  yes, she had two cell phones going at the same time  i think she missed the report that here in utah if you get caught text messaging and driving it is a minimum $750 fine  at least she wasn't going 60mph "
preparing for fhe a day late since dh had things last night that couldn't be avoided 
"yeah, we have our pre-sheetrock walk through next week!!!"
long day only four hours of sleep and a lot of driving hopefully <propfemale> feels the same way 
<propfemale> is obsessed with her b-day and it's not until may  she keeps telling us she is going to be 4 in may  today she told me she is going to have 4 parties on her birthday and she keeps bringing us birthday cakes (aka pillows)  now she is having a birthday party 
dear friends that invited me to do youville i tried but with having dial up it took way to long maybe when i move but for now i'm not going to do it 
i need to make sure i put my keys up high <propfemale> has decided that she likes them  today i spent almost 30min looking for them and finally <propfemale> remembered she put them in her block bucket

was planning on going to the state fair tomorrow with the local home schooling group but in-laws in town and we get to show off where our new place is and maybe go to the zoo and see the baby elephant   smile  <propfemale> is going to have fun w  the grandparents 
"i hate not having everything unpacked since we were going to be here for less then 5 months we didn't unpack everything  well today i found a muffin mix and was thinking \oh those sound good\""  i'm just glad i realized my muffin pans were packed before i mixed everything up """
we went to the aquariam today and had fun though it was busy i really like going on the weekdays 
hey need a favor since all of my cookbooks are packed away i need someone to find me a recipe  it's in the red and white checkered book i believe it's <propfemale> crocker may be wrong but it is the cream cheese frosting recipe  <propfemale>

"back from the park and the library now gettint the gumption to make some pumpkin chocolate chip cookes that i had planned on making sunday but was too tired  then when <propmale> get's home from his class dinner, fhe, and desseret "
the cookies last night came out good even with me buying pumpkin pie mix instead of just plain pumpkin  liahona liked fhe and really got a lot out of it   we even went to bed earlier then normal and feel rested today

today we are going to storytime and the aquariam

had fun today so far went to the library and then the park that's right there spent over an hour watching <propfemale> have fun  i feel bad for her though because she is only 3 even though she looks like 5-6 and the younger kids ignore her and the older kids get frustrated because she plays like a 3yo and not a 5 or 6 yo 
my dd is eating her vegtables today by finishing off the pace picante sauce  she loves the spicy food she loves eating those peppers found in the <propfemale> garden salad 
"dear friends yesterday i decided to block some applications farmtown being one of them  i decided that i was spending way too much time on the computer i have kept farmville, school of wizadry, fish world (dd likes feeding the fishes and cleaning the tank), and a few others which i may do every now and then  i just couldn't keep up with all the requests "
liahona has an appointment with the school speech therapist since her last evaul  was over 5 months ago  i'm hoping that she has improved enough that she doesn't need the therapy 
i also wanted to say thank you to all the brave men and women that fight for our country and sending out extra love to those in fort hood this vetrans day 
i am thankful that <propmale> was able to get christmas day off this year  it'll be the first christmas that he has had off in who knows how long

can't believe that there is only a week left before we have everything at our new place  sick and tired of driving back and forth with small loads  the only good thing is i don't have to worry about unpacking and organizing the entire place since we've been doing that the last few weeks 
"when doing your christmas cards this year, take one card and send it to the address below: a recovering american soldier c o <propfirst> <propmale> army medical center 6900 <propfemale> avenue nw washington, d c  20307-5001 -----> if you like this idea, re-post it on your status and make a soldier's day"
"yeah, in about 48 hours we we'll be out of here and totally in our new place i really can't wait sick and tired of moving and living in boxes "

yeah!!! we have phone and internet service now after spending 3 hours on the cell yesterday and sending e-mails to the local qwest represenitve and our builders low and behold it works  they still don't know who screwed up or why just glad it's cleared up 
while out and about today we also bought ourselves a eletric wheat grinder i'm excited so now instead of hand grinding wheat all day it'll only take a few minutes  can't wait to make some homemade wheat bread 
ugh i accidently blocked farmville so i lost 30 gifts can't believe i did that so if you can send me presents 
downsizing my games again thought i could do rollercoaster kingdom but that is too much i really haven't even done farmville for the last two weeks  i'm also stopping castle age don't play it much anyways and i'm not adding any new games as this time 
i love the tree topper we bought today  after years of searching we finally looked at <propfemale> pan trading and found just what we were looking for  it was the only one that we saw

<propfemale> christmas to all 
"<propfemale>'s asleep, presents under the tree, and cinammon rolls rising all that is left to do is to take care of <propfemale>'s cookies, maybe leave some reindeer tracks and head to bed "
i want to wish everyone a <propfemale> christmas and to remember the true reason behind this holiday  our savior loves us all and wants us all to return to him someday 
is glad i realized what i thought was potatoes was frosting before i added corn for <propmale>'s lunch 
saw a accident today three cars involved a car took a right turn and skidded into a car that was in the left turn <propfirst> who was hit with so much force it hit the car in the next <propfirst>  i wish people would realize that when there is snow on the grond you can't drive like you do on a nice day
