"today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend, common sense, who has been with us for many years  no one knows for sure how old he was, since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape  he will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as:-knowing when to come in out of the rain; - why the early bird gets the worm;- life isn't always fair; - and maybe it was my fault  common sense lived by simple, sound financial policies, don't spend more than you can earn and adults, not children, are in charge  his health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place  reports of a 6-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition  common sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly children  it declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer sun screen lotion or an aspirin to a student; but could not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion  common sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims  common sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar could <propfemale> you for assault  common sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot  she spilled a little in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement  common sense was preceded in death, by his parents, truth and trust, by his wife discretion, his daughter responsibility, and his son, reason  he is survived by his 4 stepbrothers; i know my rights,i want it now,someone else is to blame,i'm a victim not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone  if you still remember him, pass this on  if not, do nothing-"
