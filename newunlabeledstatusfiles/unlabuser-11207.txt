"what a strange plo table i'm at   most pots are 6-way limped  \gotta wait for hands   "
"played reallllly good today on day 2 of 10k plo    my friend who was at my table just told me i was owning the table   smile   anyways, had a good stack    played a pot, all-in on the turn as a 2:1 favorite for almost 300k in chips, and lost   if i won the pot, would of been chip leader with about 100 people left   i am actually slightly depressed about poker right now   these tournaments really wear on you "
"i watched braveheart recently, and 1 of the themes of course is freedom   and i remember thinking that i will try to enjoy july 4th more, because of how special freedom is   well, today is july 4th, and a good day to remember our freedoms and liberties   <propfemale> & the world aren't perfect, but it is great being able to do a lot of the things you want, and travel where you want   so give it up for freedom "

"day 3 over: 114,700 chips, 1251 players left, 176k avg stack   \lost some small pots at the end of the level, but i thought i played fine \the donkey to my right will be at my table tomorrow, but this time directly to my left   god please let me double through him then stack him!"
"just saw my table draw    i have the guy who is second in chips, with 741k, directly to my right    that is awesome   unfortunately, we are table 8 in pavillion, out of only 15 tables in that room - so we will be breaking during the first level of the day i think "

"90 minute dinner break, we are on the money bubble    going to be hand-for-hand when we get back \225,500 chips"
"on the one hand, it's frustrating that i've lost 2 sizable all-ins today as a favorite   on the other hand, it's refreshing to know that i faded both, and still have twice as many chips as i started the day with   i am playing really well today - even if things don't work out for me this tournament, i will not be disappointed with how i played "
"first hand back, defend my bb with 22    flop j62dd, bet 3 times into aces and win a big pot   \357k"

"out!  got it in with a7hh vs aqo on a q94hh board   i had about 200k at the time   bricked off   \i was behind, but not going anywhere with the nut flush draw ofc \disappointing, but not a bad run\hopefully next time i can win an all in "
