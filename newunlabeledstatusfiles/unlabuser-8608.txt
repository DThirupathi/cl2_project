"is trying to keep the spark of originality alive here  gonna write a 96 bar piece entitled, oh its happening! when styles clash, featuring jfk, khaos satanos, morbid locust, blakout, cabal and legion   remember, oh its happening is a registered trademark of jfk inc and can only be used with the e playful ress permission of myself, or my manager abyss and only in the context of wod  peace  lol"
96 bars done!!! now all i have to do is construct the long ass beat and throw down the psychosis! whew   i couldnt have done it without my voices     smile 
"i wonder  are we the forsaken, for having the courage to fight for what we believe in, or are we the pure for hating those who have cost us paradise?"
fuuuck!!!!!!!!!!! in addition to everything thats going on   really? bad timing  really bad timing   
"yo abyss and havok, give me a call when you get the <propmale>  if im not at home then im with <propfemale>, you know her number  its of a semi urgent nature  kiba out"

just finished the beat for a song called 'dream of <propfemale>' and its pretty awesome  a little too relaxing though  i fell asleep 3 times making it lol  but it serves its purpose then  now to record some vox

"yo, headin down to my moms for today and most of tomorrow  gonna take my driving test and hopefully get my license so wish jfk some luck  peace "
"so i'm back aaaaannnddd    i didnt   even take the fuckin test  black clouds of doom poisoned the weather and my moms car broke  the only other option was this truck with gi-fuckin-normous ladders attached to the roof of it, and the dmv wouldn't take it  so i rescheduled  <propfirst> 26th "
"i'm awake, i'm up, much to my fuckin dismay   so hit me up  byss gimme a call, you <propfemale> fucks lemme know the plans and shit, its new years and i only have till midnight to give a fuck  thats 12 hours, err   13 right now, but still   time is wasting  jfk, lets get presidential with this bitch "

"yo!!! just finished the song for citizen <propmale>, called it unbreakable(s)  i feel i did a chill job  i like speakin over beats i didnt make myself, makes my job a helluva lot easier lol  wouldnt make as much money but thats another story "
worst time ever to catch a fuckin head cold   seriously?
"i   cant   fuckin   stand   being   sick!!!! on a side note, it makes sense that i would excel at battle rap since the whole thing is heated i've always done my best work in anything when im pissed  plus, people dont hate you for being aggressive in battles, in fact   its actually encouraged "
a good friend is someone who takes the time out of his day to read your status comment and react to it  someone who spends his own money to make sure you feel better when your sick  who buys a game that he knows you've been wanting to play for a while  who takes time out of his life to check up on you and raise your spirits  looks like i have less good friends than i thought i did   
"ringers off, doin some serious sleep   "
i'm up sorta   people can call now   
had a great day with the sleeze and topped it off with a chill evening at sizzler with abyss and my <propfemale>  let the good times roll 
goin down to my moms pad for the weekend  i'l be back either sunday night or monday morning  peace ya'll 
"chillin down at my moms, fuckin love lacuna  my little girl has grown up to be easily one of the softest, cutest, and happiest dogs i've ever seen in my life    "
"just owned ass on the fuckin freeway,drove like a mothafuckin professional, though i do have the habit of speeding up to pass cars rather than let them pass me  preposterone, tiss a killer lol  still, if i drive like that, license in no time and car to follow  <propfirst> fuckin khaos, antikrist superstar, check the style!"
"yo i'm home after driving all thee way back from my moms pad  cruise control is wicked chill  my ride better fuckin have it  but anyway, 'byss call me bro  i got like    $50 bucks, and with your card, we should be able to get a decent microphone  so yeah   "
"represent the army of two!!! aries, god of war, lyrical weapon and jfk, the antikrist superstar coming soon to a hellhole near you "

"bout to start  playful erimenting with my new microphone  well see how it works  hopefully the vocal quality on my songs will go up a few notches  it was a cheap mic, more fit for podcasting that rapping but we'll see "
*sigh* i fuckin hate life   
"life has too many twists and turns  the second you set your eyes on a dream, one that you believe is truly feasible, life twists leaving you wondering where your supposed to turn now  where do i turn now? why am i reduced to turning to someone else now? i dont give a shit  i'll still make my dreams come true if it fuckin kills me "
"under this kind of pressure, i can feel the group home kid in me gettin ready to emerge again   "
"i gotta refine my flow  while my friends may like it, which is awesome  i do find myself gasping for air on track and other hip-hop heads have noticed  damnit   lol  ah well, honest criticism is how i get better "
"down at my moms pad chillin for the weekend, catch ya'll when i get back either sunday night or monday morn  peace "
"got pcc shit done today and is working on my friends pad, trying to stack my chips in the proper order  if i dont get this, i'm outta pasadena and all the shit i just did for college was a waste of fuckin time  so pray or whatever it is people do that this place falls though   "
headin back down to the cc to solidify the classes i want   
"these last 16 bars are killing me    trying to make somethin epic and memorable, verbally clever and pleasing  maintaining rhyme scheme and theme    pleasing others is fuckin difficult  still, for all my efforts i know this song will be understandable and presumably better than my others "
"legion: it was good, but really didnt tell the whole story  one metric fuck ton of angels in the heavenly host and only <propfirst> and <propfirst> are mentioned  <propmale>? nope  ithuriel? nah   lucifer? hell no  in fact, not a single named angel or demon  so while the movie was interesting, it left a lot of loopholes in the story, and i cant fuckin stand loopholes "
todays my boy havoks birthday! shits gonna be fun  some minor weights been lifted off of my chest temporarily and i'm gonna enjoy the reprieve   
"just got home, had a great time at <propmale>'s party, though too many people left early  cant wait to do somethin similar again sometime soon  so yeah   peace "

"i just realized that if, by some badass miracle i ever made it to the wwe, i'd be the antikrist superstar <propfirst> freakin khaos  because the wwe cant say fuckin  it's be censored every time i was announced "
"ah triple h  even though one half of the a o 2 is destined to retire you, your still awesomeness in a black and green bucket  taker however    i cant wait to put an end to your shit  your far past your prime and every true villian knows   it is the role of the apprentice to crave the power and the role of the master to possess it "
"i never can decide this   ever  what song should be my entrance song, at least semi permanently  what say you guys? any ideas for jfk?"
"goin to get a haircut, cut off these fuckin split ends "

"i am not having a great day   so please, feel free to call me, bitch about things,   lie to me, be an insignificant shit stain on the face of society, take my friends, abandon me, betray me, be a happy little group without me, play games that i helped pioneer, ignore the my contributions and last but not least, ask for shit that doesnt belong to you anymore  thanks, and have a wonderful day  <propfirst> fuckin khaos "
