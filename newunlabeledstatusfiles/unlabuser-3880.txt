"you never realize how awesome yuna actually is until you rewatch the wedding scene  after you choke laughing at the whole 'i can flyyyy' thing, she's actually pretty freaking cool  and then the first sending is nice to rewatch, too  she may be the only heroine i don't hate!"
is it a bad thing when you watch the saddest moments in videogaming montage and the only parts that make you cry are when they killed the horse and when tidus fades in ffx?    but really  what kind of sick and twisted person kills the godfreaking horse?!
"i find it funny that in final fantasy x, all the characters have american accents except for the bad guy  he's british  and why would anyone name their villain <propmale>? 'i am <propmale>, lord of all! spira must die!' no  (<propmale>    )"
"you know that feeling when you're doing something really fun but then you see something that makes you think of some random thing and when you go back to what you were originally doing, you find you dont want to be doing it anymore? and then you feel really bored because you dont want to do anything else, either?  annoyed "
i found something to do! not exactly prductive though     unless rewatching all the depressing videogame anime moments you know of and rating them is productive? give me your top 3!
