"writing critical reviews is not my thing  i have to use my memory about the <propmale> i've seen, but i don't have the best memory for this kinda thing  can't wait to hear my teacher saying i didn't put much detail about the pieces "
my <propmale> teachers decided that i shouldn't have a weekend this week 
the sky is really scaring me right now  maybe it's a sign i should be looking at my homework 
"one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small, and the pills that mother gives you don't do anything at all  go ask <propfemale> when she's ten feet tall "

"finally done with my carnaval paper  changed my mind, it's not fun to write about it "
today is such a beautiful day  smile  beautiful days make me happy 
"'well, who wants to be cooped up on a day like this? the sun is shining, there's songs going on   those guys are checking you out '"

"o meu livro sobre historia do filme: americanos fizeram isso, inovaram isso, or europeus fizeram aquilo, mas os americanos fizeram melhor, entao ignore os europeus  eles tambem inovaram isso, apesar de ser racista, e outros americanos fizeram um contra racismo, mas nao liga pra eles nao, porque nao sao importantes  uma imagem otima pra pessoas internacionais   "
