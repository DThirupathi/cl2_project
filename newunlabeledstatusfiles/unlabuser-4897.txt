"i may not be what you want, but i will always try to be what you need "
be sad that it's over  be glad that it was once yours 
sometimes it's hard to love someone when you're afraid they will just break your heart 
i hope that one day i will truly be your one and only  until then    life will just have to go on 
lol  yeah okay  ready for school to <propfemale> back up?
one day i hope i can truly be your one and only 
please understand that it's love that keeps us together but it's what i'm scared of that keeps us apart 
"one day soon, i will see what you see and feel what you feel "
it's my birthday!!
it's my birthday!! (thanks for the birthday wishes everybody!)
to everyone who said happy birthday to me   thank you!!!
lovers   joyful 
             
i'm surrounded by people that love me but sometimes i still feel invisible! hmmm     what should i do to change that?
7-23-06  i hate this date 
mother daughter day!
"i love you, not for what you are, but for what i am when i am with you \ \<propfirst> croft"
"don't say you love me unless you really mean it, because i might do something crazy and believe it "
"don't say you love me unless you really mean it, because i might do something crazy like believe it "
"obsession is feeling fearful that you may be\ losing him; detachment is knowing that he may be losing you; and apathy is\ the past tense of both "
"iâ€™m going to smile and make you think iâ€™m happy, iâ€™m going\ to laugh, so you donâ€™t see me cry, iâ€™m going to let you go in style,\ and even if it kills me - iâ€™m going to smile"
"when one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us \<propfemale> keller"
tired! in a hurry to finish reading invisible man 
life can sometimes suck 
"â€œwhen\i saw you, i was afraid to meet you    when i met you, i was afraid to\kiss you    when i kissed you, i was afraid to love you    now that i\love you, i'm afraid to lose you â€�"
sometimes i hate females  they can be emotional freaks 
guys can be so clueless 
sorry  maybe i just shouldn't say anything at all 
i love you! sometimes just saying those three little words is all that needs to be said 
i'm bored  talk to me!
i hate <propmale> year!!!!!!!
i hate my <propmale> classes!!!!
                                              
i hate it when people treat me like i'm stupid 
text me 
*rolling eyes*
since you're too mad to say it then i will  i love you  i could never get too mad to say that 
 smile 
"itâ€™s not my fault that i fell for you, you tripped me!!"
nobody seems to understand where i'm coming from  all you care about is him  you stopped listening to me  well i'm tired of listening to you go on and on  i'm sorry  i wish you could just understand that i love you 
"god <propmale> me the serenity \to accept the things i cannot change; \courage to change the things i can;\and wisdom to know the difference "

rip aunt <propfemale> (9-14-10)
love is a complicated guessing game 
*sigh*
*sigh* i swear you just don't understand me  or maybe that you just don't care  all i know is i hate it when i feel the way i do now  too many disappointments  too many broken promises  you win  i give up 
"perfection isn't what i'm looking for  just some consideration  hello? can anyone hear me? are you listening? i just wanted to know that you couldn't come, but instead i was left there sitting alone "
they say love can make you do some crazy things! but i think that the lack of love makes you do things even crazier!!
pizza is good!
"want to, but i canâ€™t help it  i love the way it feels, itâ€™s got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real i need it when i want it, i want it when i donâ€™t  tell myself iâ€™ll stop everyday, knowinâ€™ that i won't"
