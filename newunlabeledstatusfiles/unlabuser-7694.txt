"gettin' down to business, mate "
"i saw the flames feeding a poisonous strength, worthy of fear "
that was not the plan 
"i'm burning and i'm black in my lungs, boy you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue "
"i want you to throw my, shoes in the fire, and watch the soles burn, on the funeral pyre "
<propfirst> just backed that thannnnggg up

"wonder woman, how do you fly with such an ass?"
" surprise  = my face when i found out <propfemale> minaj's ass, tits, and face were all fake "
fortune favors the prepared 
where's your very own chalk zone when you need it?
"if i find a movie with a black ghost, <propmale> heron will give me 100 dollars  who's down for helping me out?  smile "
"snip snip, soon soon "
<propmale> <propfirst>  you are a sleaze bag asshole  and i mean that from the bottom of my heart 
they say that most aspire to reach the top of the ladder  i just aspire not to walk under it and get bad luck 
cherishing progress 
i won't waste your time with my revelation 
it is a difficult matter to keep love imprisoned 
"you gotta be able to read, to write  or so they say "
