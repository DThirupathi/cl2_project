"i got home yesterday from soar  \1) information overload \2) the class system is really confusing\3) it really helps to look at the catalog (pass) before you go\4) lectures are really boring\5) i was in a group of people that were all chemistry majors\6) it's always nice when someone else has the same problem you do\7) always call the college board to make sure they sent your scores"
"today i spent four hours in san <propfirst> shopping for school clothes after <propfirst> did a quick repair on my clarinet  but the best part of the day was sitting down and enjoying a cup of cherries garcia    it was a bowl of happiness  honestly, i think that's the happiest i've been in a while "

"i initiated a sneak attack on my band people today  it was great seeing everyone! (and you sound pretty good too ) the best reaction though goes to faizal who upon realizing that i was walking next to him squealed like a girl, leapt to hug me and didn't let go  i ended up carrying him halfway down one of <propfirst>'s halls  i'm going to miss you guys, but you'll be fine!"
