"theres a curiosity, i wonder if thatll be my meaning in life    damn it i want to want to do something meaningful to me in my life, but nothing comes to mind  i have a thought but its a ridiculous one   mayyyybe if i just put it in the back of my mind in time itll come true   as for realistically i cant think of a job thatll satisfy me "

"aww you guys checky out my tech school album   i miss you guys, hekker fun times   too mellow in these parts"
"watched the e playful endables it had its moments, but i was disappointed they didnt use everyones talents to the best of their abilities   also watched <propfirst> pilgrim that was epically entertaining x3"
i totally bit carpet when leaving the first theatre skipped and frollicked then felt my vans scrape the carpet and bit it epically
guhh i hate shopping but alass ive been putting it off for to0 long
dx    im saddened nothing to distract me
"i curse people with good intentions    i love them, but they hurt me oh so much           i dont want to think, so dont make me cry   "
im so absolutely enamored x3    impertinently i also love my fone for the wrong reason lmao
ive come to the conclusion that i am a woman and everyday i come closer and closer to wanting what a what woman wants    or maybe that was was what i wanted all along im just starting to accept or like the idea       ughhh i hate women we are so stupid   sorry my women counter parts we are   were complicated beyond all reason therefore idiotic
feeling extremely inadequate   
today was the most depressing day in the world   im astounded he made me smile          but whats more depressing than a pathetic emo loser   i want to   ehhh
i hate being in a rut how the hell i get here?!
i thought a good nap would heal me   yea   fail
wow     this day is really depressing me even now    how much of a woman ive become   im going to go be emo off in a corner now
i jux reviewed my album of when i went home   haha its never as fun to drink out here as it is when i get messed up with the fam  laugh    no one likes to down shots like we do lol
"haunting me like a sickness stealing life and breath  like the heart beats slow and cold yet emits heat so radiant it overwhelms and fakes the throat to gag    i used to love that feeling  the warmth, the energy, the anxiousness   but now the feeling crosses and betrays like it knows that im not worthy  im tempted to force its end "
i wana tomatoe  laugh 
dies a little inside when i realize that people arent as connected as i once thought   the relationships we share are so fickle  
sad   i missed his call wahhh
so completely enamored   i cant wait till we can be together again
"1  my roomate hates me and wont talk to me   we hav a room inspection tomorrow, our kitchen is a mess 2  i went over my minutes its going to cost me atleast $80 extra 3  i hav 60 pgs of cdcs due next week          frustrated and sad   can i give up now i think i dont want anymore   "
"    today    just not today, lets take a step back and watch bullshit roll by in fact lets smile and wave at my sad dispositon as it passes    yea no not gonna happen, guhh"
nothing but cloud nine   nothing gets me as high when i cant stop smile my retarded smile   ahhh sweet
ok to bed   tis late   ill be thinking of you so that maybe i can dream of only you tonight   if dream at all  playful 
"a dream   happy thoughts with cloud nine connotations   a smile, an endless e playful ression of how it penetrates my heart   i feel it   this feeling that brought a child to reckless indulgence with innocence written across her actions    a cruel but oh so sweet pain, id fall head first"
ehh little bit of a hangover   i guess i did over did it a little last night  
im a fool im going to end up biting it flat on my damn face
what wilts and withers in the face of despair   is fickle but realize what brightness it had at its prime the beauty that would be nothing but mortality
"call me when you get this i dont care what time   something has been bothering me and im too groggy tell me to wake my ass up, besides i got laundry i need to take care of please and thank you   like you lots x3"
ok so if it werent for my incompetence id be rather useful now wouldnt i?
for goodness sake   dont let my optimistic high lose its momentum
hopefully get some good sleep tonight    what dreams may come   hopefully only cloud nine thoughts haunt me tonight
my head is not on straight i think it needs some minor adjustments anyone have a wrench? > laugh 
mayybe i appreciate the little things a little too much   im not cut out for this
"she's still a child a ignorant heart driven child *smiles* the way her heart swoons over the little things    the trip to the store, the smile on your face, the watching tv on the couch, the gentle gesture, the thoughtful considerations which had no attachments *smiles imagining* yea this girl is hopeless in love with loving those people she holds so dear"
today was good    its amazing cant believe ive recovered from such bad mojo   more so im looking forward to this weekend hopefully itll turn out x3
im missing him its been 3 er 4 days and not a word   wow what timing statement retracted
id do anything to be that cat   to feel his warm palm to my cheek *purrrrr* lol
"psychological tactic to get a positive response - lesson one : when you need something done instead of saying \here do this\"" say \""please could you do me a favor?\"" more often then no people will be happy to say sure", then you can get them to do what you need \dfcff7049f12a01272a31a16224c2c5b,"so tell me why are some people so ignorant to simple little things that they dont realize that they come off as rude, inconsiderate, stuck up, bitchy   or is it they just dont care   im thinking that they just dont appreciate the little things like i do    how sad   theres a difference between e playful ressing a negative emotion and emitting it like wildfire"
aww daddy called me a feel so special  laugh    but hes not feeling so well  stop drinking soda its bad for your condition  playful  ahh my goodness
aww i see them smile i cant help but smile
"wo0ho0o i ran the fastest mile and half ive ever ran for my pt test i got a 87 percentile yay    its just too @$#%@ that i failed   lol aww do atleast get a booby prize   guess not, heres to my new mandatory pt regime wo0o"

"why would i want anything else? pet peaves ive just realized - when people doubt me, when people decide to not be entirely honest with me, self justification   just screw you, you misleading assholes!"
"i havent lost it that drifting dreamer feeling im happy, but now i remember why i grew out of it   *sigh* whats worse having life slap you around or dream happy dreams and let life smack you around just every now and then? im scared because i dont know what i want or how i can achieve it bo0o   depressionism *sad solem face*"
"i love my life twice a day just because of him x3 cloud nine is awesome until you hit the ground after it disapates, but ill take what i can get  laugh "
for a moment i was thinking deviously about my bf x3 lol bo0o hes running around korea a bit its been two days since he last called dx then i thought about what work i have to do bo0o can i just sleep it all off again? lol
no one can make my day like he can  laugh 
space-headedness isn't cute its a personal demotivator and a troublesome trait
damn there is nothing like talking for hours on end with him   only the onset of starvation can pull us away   ok not true theres work and friends and going out lmao   but gahhh so0o very very in love i smile till my cheeks hurt  laugh 
hanasakeru seishonen is a anime shojo that seems pretty interesting until i realize the main character is so damn fickle its not cute   how do you not realize how much someone loves you when theyre right in your face   i guess <propmale> people can afford to be so stupid
aww cuteness to the <propmale>   anyways lets go eat do laundry and see what over ppl are up to
i want to send him sumthing special    hmm  love 
"i love you and    theres nothing you can do about it!!! pwahahahahahah~  lol, but no really   itll take wayyyyyyy more than that to get rid of me x3  wink "
"was on the downward spiral of rut and self-destruction of doom    then she remembered why she does it everyday    she does it for the ones she loves  \for them anything,\for them she'd do it over and over and over again 'till she got it right  \she'd give her life,"
"great, my weekend doesnt start till monday    this sucks    i cant even have a drink and gahh im so thirsty"
"i do appreciate all the little things you guys hav done and do for me so very much   and it kills me that ive failed to do the same   that unknowlingly ive taken somethings for granted   i havent exercised my gratefulness as much as i should   i love you all i really do, please never think otherwise   ask me and to the best of my power i will do anything if it made you smile at true happiness"
"got to think clearly with honesty and authenticity   no adaptation my imperfections small and large aren't going to change through twisted implication   determination and will power,    its sucks they are my lowest categories *sigh* but anything anything to better myself right?"
"down right fugly   where is my whymsical airy dreams go? sucked away into oblivion? come back my haltal, my muse you make calm and forgiving   "
there you are my muse my happy dreams   i know i lose you somewhere sometime so0n but ill always find you again i know it  
zomg i love him  laugh    neway wth rub! why u call the one time i charge my fone while ts off!? gahh ill call uz 2morrow bo0o0o0o love you bro!!
there is just something about a crisp white collar and some sharp dark slacks mew    time to be productive-ish
"pwahahahah even that one cant get me down today  laugh  yess! pwhahaha   oh love, anyway   *shakes fist* you bad little children what are we going to do with you? our fearless leader cant do it all on his own now can he? well have to come together to keep this one at bay!   off to bx and cdcs i go, but ill be back to pester your ears later"
"so very unsat this morn, but all in name of a better mood so im for it"
dying of boredom and paranoia    going to sleep now very unsat hopefully tomorrow something good will happen its a damn weekend for goodness sake
"its that smile, that genuine happiness that only comes with being with the company you adore    to see it written on their faces   i would give anything  smile with me you know its all i want x3"
do0pa do0o da do0p x3   he cant help but brighten up my day  laugh  yayz   hmm i wonder how everyone at home is doing i should send my mail   hmm i hope i have stamps lets see
"havent felt \look in the mirror\"" sexy in so long   iono kno why but its the silliest thing  even though ive been down fast food for a couple of weeks now   i just had to dance i felt so good lmao"""
"imaturity   it cant be fun, but also very irritating    i think its another reason why people are so untrusting untrustworthy  or am i too forgiving, undoubting, or generous to people  i hope im not just too passive   i care about things "
all day everyday sleep sleep sleep   grahh damnit imma get up and do shit this time  i promie myself er else   no treats!
"reminded once again, i am a women   cute sweet and evil  those kind that wear their emotions on their shoulders    gahhh i dont like being evil but everyone just throws themselves into the flame    i feel like a jerk"
"i feel like crap, all i do is crap, and i wish i was more than this   i still remember why i do it everyday, but dont recall why im still not doing it as well as i want to"
"hmm i realized just now that im not the only one who wears their emotions on their sleeves   no matter how hard he tries his face looks so solemn when he cant smile in honesty   it looks nothing like his genuine warm light hearted smile   its a horrible thing to wear your emotions on your shoulders   i hope i can one day smile lightly without effort, so that my downfalls dont drag anyone with me"
slowly gaining a bit of respect for 'em   i wonder if a little birdy showed 'em the way  im glad if this keeps up i might even be inspired x3
"almost offended i got a 7 10   i got a c? wha? lol   ferget <propfemale> because i know im atleast a b- lmao    retaliation, but i kno im not all that and a bag a chips id give myself a 5  playful "
"theres a thank you in every breath that a breathe a greatfulness whispered and forgotton as it escapes my lips  i remember why i know i shouldnt regret these moments though small and insignificant  im still moving still  ever so slowly, but baby steps are all i need "
"there we go again   contradiction in that fucked up way  i can work and support myself in the name of the ones i love, but the catch is i never get to see them or i can be a leach and a bum and see them all the time  i hate you system i hate you with a passion  i want to see them and be with them thats why get up in morning everyday  i shoot up the middle finger to whoever designed it this way  i want another option "
maybe just a little light on this spit-shine
thank you  you guys dont realize how much i really do appreciate every little thing you do for me  i hope that i do something for you as well  hmm you should let me know how i can make you smile even if just for a moment x3
"i've had this massive disgusting mood swing since yesterday  i've snapped at two of my friends  i don't know whats wrong with me and its pissing me off    i want to see them, its been far too long i cant stand it "

"reminded how things how are headed down hill, just when i've got my feet on the ground too  my muse is so very far away     this is not the way to start a week"
it seems its not so simple to ask for happiness
a second reminder why i must pick myself up yay    i hope i get a wake up call
"grahh finally finished cleanimg my room guhh    now only laundry, trash, homework, kitchen (if i ever decide to clean my roommates mess), life, love, future   lol yea im such a loser    playful "

"kyah~ everytime i see his face, talk to him, or think about him i can't help but smile  laugh "
you feel so much better after you've cleaned up your surroundings   hmm but then again maybe its just an e playful ression of how your feeling   your room looks like crap your probably feeling like crap   your rooms all in order you feel       uhhh ok lol
"well for me this is like 2 hours ahead of time for me, but i guess since everyone else is doing it     happy anni- 080, you all are losers i love you  laugh   playful "

10 mins 10secs alright fair enough i reach 5 mins or rather less than 6 mins i will move on to medium puzzles

to bed with me    love  love you hun x3
"i'm always wondering if love him more  , because i know for sure i love him more than he knows "
"so, i was being a jerk-off today  ok more than a jerk-off a couple of curse words that im not proud to admit  its one thing if you disrespect me, its another thing to disrespect me to the point of me reveling whenever you are in frustration, and yet another thing when you disrespect someone i care about and i know wont do anything about it "
