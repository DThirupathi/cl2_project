"okay, i'm strangely drawn to american idol despite the fact that there are only 3 people who can sing this year   all the other are there because they're pretty "
"please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone who needs a smack upside the head  people who need a smack upside the head often affect the lives of many  there is still no known cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head, except a smack upside the head, but we can raise awareness "
"my child is reading popular science while massacre-ing (how do you spell that?) some song on her new recorder   oh, and watching bear grylls, whom she thinks is truly cool   i think he's an idiot, but i kinda like watching him eat bugs   it's like watching the immediate consequences of stupidity   almost time for junkyard wars "

tonight i get to convince people that they like machiavelli   the big question: is he a pessimist or a realist?
i am forcing some friends out to see how to train your dragon   hehehe
my children have an unwholesome interest in bear grylls   i fear that <propmale> is getting some really bad ideas   <propfirst> is just storing information in case she's ever stranded in one of these places   i understand that one since i still know a back way out of everywhere in case the kgb is chasing me   but <propmale> has unhealthy speculation in his eyes as he watches 
"<propfirst> made a series of bad choices this morning, which i allowed trying not to protect her from the consequences of her own actions, and she's gone to school without breakfast   it's killing me   why should doing what will make her more responsible be so painful for me?  seems unfair, somehow   my mom always seemed to thoroughly enjoy this sort of situation "

"walk naked in <propfemale> day don't forget to <propfirst> your calendars  as you may already know, it is a sin for a muslim males to see any woman other than his wife naked and if he does, he must commit suicide    so next saturday at 1 pm eastern time, all american women are asked to walk out of their house completely naked to help weed out any neighborhood terrorists "
"circling your block for one hour is recommended for this anti-terrorist effort  all patriotic men and patriotic partners (donâ€™t ask, donâ€™t tell) are to position themselves in lawn chairs in front of their houses to demonstrate their support for the women and to prove that they are not muslim terrorist sympathizers  since islam also does not approve of alcohol, a cold 6-pack at your side is further proof of patriotism"
tact is for people not clever enough to be sarcastic   a motto to live by

"i feel slightly better, so i hate fewer people "
