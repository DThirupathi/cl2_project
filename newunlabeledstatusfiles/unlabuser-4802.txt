im not a football player  a football player is someone who plays against other teams in the hope of a hard fought victory  i am a football practicer  i practice football and get yelled at for doing it wrong  the story of my life 
"t c west just got a lesson on why we're bnc champs  kill cats!                       *vikings fought to literally die, looking for an opponent strong enough to defeat them so they could enjoy the afterlife, thus the berserker, unleashing all anger and energy on the offense, armor was for the weak * go berserk, cats are next!"
"at football video, then home "

now we are district champions  we won 28 to 0  on the road to regionals 
"the game goes to <propmale>, <propfirst>, <propfirst>, and <propmale>  definently "
"mt  pleasant coming up  going to be a great game  they're a solid team, but so are we  strap up "
cadillac football is done for the season  time to move toward the future 
"you can only take so many hits before you break, or you break someone else "
parents are annoying lol
"hello darkness, my old friend  i've come to talk with you again  because a vision softly, creeping, left it's seeds while i was sleeping  and the vision, that was planted in my brain, still remains, in the sound, of silence "
tired of everyone  why can't you all leave me alone? you can only harass me so much before i do something about it 
"\the bad turns to worse and the worse turns into hell \"" -godspeed-anberlin"""

"i don't know what it is about football  the grass, the hot and cold, the burn of air in your lungs, or the fans in the stands  all i know, is that its something we all love  but the good times have to have an end  then there's the real side of football  its not something you can describe to people  its the silence in the locker room  that bitter silence at the end of a good run "
everything hurts  everything is dark  the negative presses deep against you harder than any tackle ever could  it rearranges your guts and smashes you into the ground  a dark presence so terrible you can't help but wish you had never woken up 
"its easy to smile when your team is going strong  its easy to laugh at the jokes  its all easy  until the end comes  its there that the real men come out  its there, where players realize that they aren't players anymore, and that they'll never wear those cleats or shoulder pads again  that the helmets going to <propfemale> for another year, another player, another young man ready to take on the challenge "
its when that darkness touches your soul that you must choose  its when you understand that there's not another week  that there's not another <propmale>  the boys become men  the stars in your eyes dim  but they don't die  its not the end of us  its not the end of football  we will live on  once a team  always a team  there's no other way to look at it  we are the cadillac vikings of 2010-2011  we'll always live on
