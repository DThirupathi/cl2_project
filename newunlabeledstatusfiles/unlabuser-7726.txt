424 i've gotten to know you very well over the years and even though we live states apart it seems like you just live in another city close   it's been over 7 years since i've seen you so that means you need to visit even though you will say i'll hold you hostage   smile  but i know you are saying now that it's me that needs to visit you but i know you will hold me hostage and my family will miss me terribly 
624 i miss you bunches and wish you were here   even though i was an annoying twreep growing up who would have thought we would have gotten so close   i miss my best friend and can't wait to see you again

"47 you are like my second mom, which i hold very sacred  you have been there for me through the roughest of times and never turned your back  i feel lucky to have you in my life and for you to be family makes it even more special"
30910 we are family and even though we don't always stay in touch as much as we should i know i can count on you in a time of need   i love you very much
it's 9pm on a saturday night and i'm watching spongebob
dyl is about to go home as soon as his aunt comes to pick him up   boy i forgot how self sufficient <propfirst> <propmale> had become   having a 2 year old at my apt all weekend has made me remember 
"another weekend gone by   i just relaxed the day away watching movies and listening to the kids play, fight, and play again   christmas is alomost here "
i'm so wore out 
i'm so tired   we went grocery shopping and spent two hours there
today is one of those days when i want to throw my hands in the air and give up all while crying my eyes out   can things get any worse?
"i'm feeling alittle better now   thank goodness for my happy pills   first time in a long time that i'm not looking forward to christmas, but at least it will be closer to 2011"
it's the weekend time   today is a little better than yesterday but then  i get to thinking and all goes downhill   i think i'm just going to get lost in some books this weekend 
it's friday and i'm at home   i'm betting myself no one calls to see what i'm doing tonight  (unless they read this) oh well i don't give a shit is my thought 
getting ready to head to belton with the family to see the lights on the lake   i'm on book three right now so good thing i'm not driving so i can read until it gets dark

it's a relaxing sunday and i'm ready for a 4 day work week and then a 4 days weekend
my meeting went well today   hopefully things are changing for the better   isn't it crazy when someone tries to make shit you do bad but when they do same shit it is not the same   crazy!!! makes me laugh
"just woke up to my dog barking   go figure   i was hoping to sleep until morning, but seems i can't even do that "
