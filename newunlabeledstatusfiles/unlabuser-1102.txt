like this and i'll tell you my honest feelings about you 
"throughout life some people will treat you unjustly and cause a deep scar in your heart  let go and let god deal with what they do  hate would only consume you  instead, you should move forward with faith that god is always by your side and as long as you treat others fairly and with compassion, believe that the tears you cried in the past will certainly be replaced with innumerable blessings from him   soon"
