"well , i am in cc comping drinks and sharing and for some of you,for the last time  there are several that i can honestly say i will miss reading your chat, but just as you needed me to be your friend in cc, i needed your friendship in the games that i enjoy and need friends to progress too  i was ignored, and i don't call that friendship i only asked those that already had the game installed, wasn't asking much "
"okay! i think i might need to clarify  if i have not requested you in the last 2 weeks, since i gave original notice of my intent you will not be blocked or deleted  i do not block or delete just because you don't play the same games i do i ignore requests for other games all the time it is only after i have given ample time to accept, and only if game has already been played by you!"
pogo badges call    btw dominoes is a bitch!
anybody else having problems getting poker blitz to load?
