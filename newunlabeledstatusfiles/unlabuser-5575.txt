your faith or lack of it will affect many generations 2 come  don't let your anger with people of god keep you from raising children of god            john macarthur
"know that at sometime or another everyone that you love in your life will hurt you, you decide who is worth the pain           "
faith is not believing that god can  faith is knowing that god will!!!!!!!!!!!
let go and let god             
sometimes the very thing that we are looking for is staring us right in the face  yet it isnt until that we lose it that we truly understand the value of something that was once worthless to us!!!!!
a woman's heart should be so lost in god that a man needs to seek him in order to find her!!!!
"there are some people who think that if they put up enough walls then they will b safe, the irony is instead of locking others out u actually lock yourself in  u may avoid a few things that make life difficult, but in the end u also miss out on the wonderful things that make life worth living!!!! b blessed!"
"love, in all its fragile forms is the one most powerful, enduring force that brings real meaning to our everyday lives    so love like you've never been hurt  try, although the odds say you're gonna fail  trust, like you've never had doubts  believe, because god is able to do exceedingly abunduntly more than we could ever think or ask     "

"we r all born with potential greatness and blessed with numerous opportunities 2 soar 2 new heights,but many of us are too lazy or 2 concerned with what others think or just too afraid of change 2 ever stretch our wings    so do whatever makes u happy and do it as best as u can      b encouraged!!!!"
"dont stress over whether or not u r doing the right thing  you'll always know the answer  in your heart, so rather than be discouraged remember that rejection and resistance are almost guaranteed when yr doing something important, when u set out to live your dreams many people (including those who love u the most, n those who got yr back)will try 2 hold u back!!!!b blessd!!!"
"do something u never thought u'd do   live in the moment and follow only your own road where ever it may lead u, your life's journey isn't a race or a competition  embrace the unpredictable and e playful lore for things that inspire u, take time to enjoy the view and above all b at peace with yourself  u r god's special creation!!! b encouraged!!!!"

"we all have filters on, so mostly we see only what we want to    there r many folks who r certain that the world is an extremely hostile place no matter what u show or tell them  they stand ready to defend themselves from a million dangers everyday until eventually they become as hard, ugly, and cruel as the world they have imagined         "

"love, in all its fragile forms, is the one powerful,enduring force that brings real meaning to our lives  not passionate, romantic love   the love i mean is the fire that burns inside of us, the inner warmth that prevents our soul from freezing in the winters of despair    it's the love of life itself its knowing that through all your failures or fears that god is still able!!!!"
"following your own path is incredibly rewarding, but definately not easy, like everyone else, u will have some days that r better than others and some days that seem like a total disaster, but whatever happens just <propfemale> on! follow yr dreams at least u will exhaust yourself doing what u love most!! it transforms everything about you from ordinary to extraordinary!!!!"

this is the day that the lord has made   i will rejoice and be glad in it    
with temptation comes choices    with choices comes responsibility     
our greatest weakness is the lack of faith in ourselves!!!
"this too shall pass    life is too short to hold on to hurt and pain and past mistakes, while you're going through your storm it never looks like there is any relief in sight but with all storms, no matter the destruction it causes and the devastation that it leaves behind    it too shall pass!!!!"

"love is patient, love is kind, love does not envy, it keeps no record of wrongs     love protects, comforts, perserves, love never dies       "
why try to blend in with others?? you were created to stand out!!!!!!
you will never possess what you are unwilling to pursue     if its worth having then its worth the work that it will take to keep it        
when you feel like you can no longer stand    kneel      
you cannot appreciate the light if you have not known darkness    you cannot understand love if you have not e playful erienced pain    you cannot <propfemale> at the sunlight unless you've been through the rain              
you cannot conquer that which you are afraid to confront!!!!
there is always beauty and hope in even the most awful circumstances      
strength is born from the courage to do what has to be done no matter how painful it may be!!!!
the soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears      cherokee proverb
"greatness is not acheived by never falling, but by rising every time we fall    "

words left unspoken often speak the loudest!!!!!
our greatest weakness lies in giving up    the most certain way to succeed is to always try one last time                   
my bed is calling       goodnight fb    
dance like no one's watching      laugh like its the funniest thing you've ever heard    love like you've never been hurt   live each day like it was your last

i love me!!!!!!
out of the fullness of the heart    the mouth speaks       
the moment our eyes met      i knew
the most unfortunate thing about a woman's worth is that many times she herself does not know what she is worth!!!!
"wasn't it just yesterday, the very first time when you whispered my name    i saw the light in your eyes and i knew deep inside we'd b sooo much more than friends     "
