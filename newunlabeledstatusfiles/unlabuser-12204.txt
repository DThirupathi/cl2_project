"come up to meet you, tell you i'm sorry you don't know how lovely you are  i had to find you, tell you i need you, tell you i set you apart  nobody said it was easy, it's such a shame for us to part  nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be t"
finished the bean tree's   probably one of the best books i have ever read   i have now officially completed summer reading!!  smile 
at berea   dropping my sister off  sad ( it's going to be sad to leave her behind!!!
you used to think that someone would come along  and lay beside you in the space that they belong  but the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new  what's the point of holding onto what never gets used?
i have to face the truth  that no one could ever look at me like you do  like i'm something worth holding on to  these times i think of leaving  but it's something i'll never do  'cause you can do better than me  but i can't do better than you  
could connor's house be any more boring???!!!!
when the sun departs i feel a hole down in my heart   put on some shoes come down here and listen to the blues    wondering if anything will go right    or will you dance with me tonight    iâ€™m looking at you youâ€™re looking at me    two broken lives working in <propfemale>    might make for a decent time so get up and dance with me    
the family stone movie is a very compelling movie   it makes me think differently about the way i could treat or love my family  we all need a kick-in-the-face sometimes to make us realize what truly is special to us 
being sick can totally screw up everything!!!!!
i am sick of being    sick!!!!
things in my life are definitely going to start changing   for the better!!!

"i've been beaten down, i've been kicked around,  but she takes it all for me  and i lost my faith, in my darkest days,  but she makes me want to believe  they call her love, love, love, love, love   they call her love, love, love, love, love  she is love, and she is all i need  she's all i need "

"some days her shape in the doorway  will speak to me  a bird's wing on the window  sometimes i'll hear her when she's sleeping  her fever dream  a language on her face or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come some days, like rain on the doorstep, she'll cover me  with grace in all she offers  sometimes i'd like just to ask her  what honest words  she can't afford to say,maybe as sure as tomorrow will come    "

"summer: i love the smiths  tom: sorry?  summer: i said i love the smiths   summer: [they stare at each other for a moment] you    you have good taste in music   tom: [repeating after her] you    like the smiths?  summer: [singing] to die by your side, such a heavenly way to die   i love em   tom:  holy shit "

"well youre the closest thing i have to bring up in a conversation about a love that didn't last  but i could never call you mine  cause i could never call myself yours  and if we were really meant to be, well then we justify <propfemale>  its not that our love died  just never really bloomed "

"it's always easy to see the negative points in life  when in fact, the positive things outweigh the negatives  things could be a lot worse  but making what counts really matter, should be the goal  not sitting around pitting yourself "
and i've always lived like this   keeping a comfortable distance   and up until now  i've sworn to myself that i'm content with loneliness   because none of it was ever worth the risk   
all my worries will be lost tomorrow at 9:22  9:23 is looking pretty good though

christmas music! nothin' like it!
maybe the reason we don't want to grow up   is because we don't want to know the bad things that were always kept from us
