"you know i am 25 years old, although some people don't realize it but i am an adult and i would like to think that grants me some respect when talking to me  just because someone has 20 years on me doesn't mean they can talk to me like i am a piece of shit  if you don't like what i have done with my life or my opinions don't talk to me  simple as that!"
