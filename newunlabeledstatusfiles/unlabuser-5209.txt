so since my account got hacked i redid my facebook i actually like my new facebook more pictures and its better  smile )
"had a break from school today trying to add all my friends from my other facebook \thats gonna take forever"
"everyone is talking bout having such a bad week but ive had a great week \idk what it is normally my week sucks but this week was awesome happy and calm  smile "
"church was great                  have a small headache but other then that nothing much \i feel like tlking to a random person like someone i dont know you know? hahahaha whtever   laugh "
"tired but in a good mood you know we need to be friends with everyone even if they arent \kool\"" or if they are different from u i watched a movie last night and a guy killed himself b c people sucked just think bout how others would feel if u were their friend and was ther                 some people need u even if they dont act like it"""
 smile ))))) we all go back to school tommorrow              think bout what i said b4 everyone needs a friend just b c a person isnt in ur click doesnt mean their not cool you cud be saving them from suicide or cutting or running away you really cud so just try to be friends with the kid sitting alone and dont be mean or tease them but be their friend
in a good mood          really happy but got some stuff on my mind and its just really stressful        it has nothing to do with my friends or family but its about my really dad and to be honest how i really want to live with him so that i can get to know him
"in a good mood tlked to someone special today and happy about it \no it wasnt a crush or anything but my dad my own father ( real on ) and my aunt b  smile "
i just want that guy who stares at me with that spark in his eye  that guy who i know i like with no doubt that guy who likes me even if he doesnt know me that guy who will love me someday or at least has the possibility to love me i just want him
if i died tonight wht would you do?  crying  what would you say and would you even care?
i had a huge crush on this guy at my old school and i didnt think he liked me then my friend says he liked me which makes me mad b c ive moved  so should i even try a long distance relationship or move on?????
