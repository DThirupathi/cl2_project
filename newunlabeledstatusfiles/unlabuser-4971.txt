i think the 15th is going to be a really really good day  cross your fingers and wear your shirts inside out 
"standing on the edge of the palisades' cliffs, in the shadow of the skyline very far away "
"you said enough  you said too much  you focus only on her touch, you halcyon "
"get up, get out, get away from these liars cause they don't get your soul or your fire "
you can keep your birds if you dont know how to use your turn signal 
new kitties!!
big day tomorrow  good thing i got new shoes! wish me luck! with algorithms  
today's the day!  joyful 
april 1st! whoo hoo!
"if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix, you wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz "
television rules the nation    around the world   
"itâ€™s a mess, itâ€™s a st<propmale>, itâ€™s a flawed work of <propmale> "
take back this city for yourself tonight  i'll take back the city for me 
i love this city tonight  i love this city always  it bears its teeth like a light and spits me out after days 
all this feels strange and untrue  
on a live wire right up off the street you and i should meet 
junebug skipping like a stone with the headlights pointed at the <propfemale> 
we're concentrating on falling apart 
"jesus christ that's pretty face, the kind you'd find on someone i could save  if they don't put me away, it'll be a miracle "
such a relaxing past few days  entirely too content   smile 
i'm not gonna lie  i want you for mine  my blushing bride 
i could sit here for hours finding new ways to be awed each minute 'cause the daylight seems to want you just as much as i want you
"oh gotta see, gotta know right now  what's that riding on your everything?"
it's like a book elegantly bound but in a language that you can't read just yet 
and so it is just like you said it would be
"with the lights out, it's less dangerous"
my chemical romance?
today is gonna be a long day   
hurry up 8 o'clock!
ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out
don't be that note i can't hold  don't be that joke that i told and told until it got old 
initiative comes to thems that wait 
"the time has come, my little friends   "
why do i always get to work incredibly early whenever i plan on being late?
"come on skinny love, just last the year   "
these walls are paper thin and everyone hears every little sound
my knowledge is comprehensive 
"tomorrow's children will need a light to shine the way  without you, who will tell them to stay?"
happy zombie jesus rabbit egg finding day
i'm a peasant in your <propfemale> arms penniless with only charm 
i'm in space
windmill for the land turn forever hand in hand 
it's a paralleladox!
i do not think anyone knows what they're doing here
