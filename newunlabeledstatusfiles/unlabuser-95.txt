just spent about thirty minutes outside talking to jehovah's witnesses  about my dog 
found a stray dog yesterday~ she's a beauuutiful little dachshund; very sweet and all that  anybody want another pet?   seriously 
just poured half a pot of boiling water on my hand  and may have cracked my favorite yixing teapot in the process 
"rolled my ankle pretty badly yesterday while playing tennis  i still can't walk like a normal biped  thanks, brian~"
"thank you to everybody! i love all of you (well, most of you  haha) and i thank you for all the well-wishes  it's been a somewhat dull day, since i started summer classes  but that's okay! it's twice as appreciable now that that's over "
praying for my grandfather that'll be going into surgery in about 20 minutes  and hoping for the very best 
"trying to jog in 99 degree weather? made it a half a mile, lol  need just a liiiitle heat relief "
awww  <propfirst> mccartney on late night with <propfirst> <propfemale>! he's too cool 
"heyyy, i haven't been on here in so long, so i thought i'd post something~ here it is "
