"have you been feeling stagnant lately, aquarius, as if your life is going nowhere? what happens today could change that  an unusual group event could put you in touch with people who open new intellectual, career, or spiritual doors for you  stimulating conversations could turn your head toward opportunities that you were never aware of before  onward and upward!"

"today,the <propfemale> moves into quirky,independent aquarius,a sign that thinks ahead of the mainstream,breaks all the rules,and holds the spark of creative genius  this is a great day for thinking outside the box and coming up with innovative solutions to age-old problems  the <propfemale> in aquarius also allows us to step back from our personal dramas and view ourselves with cool detachment,very good for accurate self-assessment"
