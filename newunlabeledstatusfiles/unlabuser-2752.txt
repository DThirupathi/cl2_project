so i have been out of the closet for over ten years now    so why is it that my cats keep wanting to go back into the closet?? then have even figured out how to open the damn closet door since i won't let them in    is it just me or is this rather oxy-moronic???
got to <propfemale> with some of my copley peeps tonight     all it takes is an hour and i realize why that is no longer my fulltime job     while i am sad to only see you guys a couple times a month i am in a much better place ;o)
"just doesn't understand how the snow could stop, and we could have such a huge warning, and yet the streets are still crappy      but must say that i was quite impressed to see that the parking lot to the liquor store was spotless"
tonight at work my co-workers decided i am in heat    ha
"got a lot done today, it is amazing what can happen when i get out of bed before noon    the only downside is that i know i am gonna be dragging all night at work"
off to copley i go
it really needs to slow down at work cause i need to get some homework done
really enjoyed my day off yesterday      sad to have to go back today
really enjoyed the weather today     wish it could stay like this
"so why is it that i have been trying to play with <propfemale> all day and she has wanted nothing to do with me, but the minute i try to do some homework and open my book she decides she wants to be a lap cat and lay accross the book???"
so i watched the real house wives of orange county today     amazing what you find to watch while you are sick    and i want to have a tupperware party hosted by a drag <propfemale>  i think that would be hella fun
"gonna be a long ass day    just finished class, have to go get ready for work, cpr from 11-3 then work from 3-11     i am gonna need a lot of coffee"
cinnamon is home from the vet    you wouldn't even know she had surgery cause she started being naughty 5 minutes after i let her our of the carrier     <propfemale> seems to be happy to have her friend back though  ;o)
we may have some bad days    but i can honestly say i love my job
so <propfemale> is coming over tuesday night to help me wash my pussies cause they stink   i am making dinner and she is brining the wine    hell we might need to down the wine midway between the bathes cause i am thinking fur is gonna fly (no pun intended)
"ok so i need to get into governement office to set up a system for distributing drivers licenses      you must be over 18, under 65, meet a certain iq level and have some common sense    "
so i watched paranormal activity last night    although it does start of kind of slow i think it is the scariest i have ever seen
so i was in a really shitty mood last night because i thought for sure i failed my first world religions test   now today i am in an incredibly good mood cause i opened up my grade log to find i got a 98%     this is the crap those mastercard comercials are made of
"the only thing i hate more than the house being dirty, is actually cleaning it ;o("
i am sad i have to go back to work tomorrow    wish vacation was longer
so i tried to bake a cake tonight      failed miserably  ;o(
why do i always seem to get the patients with the most complicated histories??
<propfemale> told me i looked like mr  rogers in my sweater today ;o(
"<propfemale> and cinnamon are still naughty, naughty, naughty     but i love these these damn pussies      now how is that for something you never thought you would hear a gay guy say? ;o)"
so tonight at work me and <propfemale> were told we were white trash by a patient     oh how i love my job
i just need a break      why can't we be like bears and just go into hibernation for a while?
"so i have come to the conclusion i am physically, mentally, and phychologically exhausted     is there something to clear all that??  maybe i should check into the 5th floor at work"
"i do not understand how people think gardening is a hobby and or relaxing    i am completely cut up from the <propfemale> bushes, got attacked by a million bugs, i am dirty, and dripping in sweat        there is nothing theraputic about that"
"just watched the season finale of grey's anatomy    while i am glad all my favorite characters survied, and not so upset that some of the ones i didn't like were killed off    it is still not the same without izzie and <propfirst> ;o("
so within about a month's time i was told i was white trash by a patient and low budget  by a rather pompus queer    if i didn't know better i might get a complex     ha
so me and <propfirst> are down on a trauma   as we are shooting films in 4a the chaplain decides he needs to console the patient in 4b    so i tell the chaplain we are about to shoot x-rays and he needs to come out with us    and he ignores me      so i say chaplain god is not gonna protect you from these x-rays so you better get out here    needless to say he came out and <propfirst> cracked the hell up  ;o)
thanks <propfemale> for helping me clean the stinky pussy     now cinnamon and <propfemale> smell so fresh and so clean clean
i am completely exhausted    time for bed
i hate <propmale> labor     now i see why people pay so much for landscaping
will i ever get my power back?
yay for finally having power back!!!!!
who is going to the parade on sunday??  i will be spending the majority of the day at <propfemale> kat   hope to see everyone ;o)
it was great seeing everyone yesterday    i had tons of fun    not sure i will be drinking again for a long while though!
i feel like i am overdue for a good cry    
"is going to see <propfemale> lauper tonight with <propfirst>, <propfirst>, and <propfemale>     i am super excited"
"<propfemale> lauper at the house of blues tonight was phenomenal!!!!  she did an acoustic version of time after time, i was in heaven!!!!"
wonders how the hell some of these residents made it through school!!!
"ok so tonight at work we came up with 2 really good drag names     pop a rocks (in your mouth not in your hands    and absoluta whore   we also set a date to go to the baton club,  although i am not sure why we were obsessed with drag queens tonight, it made for some hilarious conversation"
"had a blast at <propmale> and <propfirst>'s house this weekend    was good to see some old friends and make some new ones, too bad i made an enemy      my liver i am getting too old for this shit"
"so i got my comed <propmale> today    can anyone tell me how the hell i could go without power for over 2 days, yet have the highest electric <propmale> i have ever had???"
so maybe there should be a rule that first year residents can't put in their own orders    how in the hell these people making it through school??
so tonight at work i broke a wheelchair while i was helping get a patient out of it   avani my little indian coworker looked at me and in her broken english told me i must be a vampire since i broke it     ha i love it
finished my business project for my case studies course     thank god!!!  just 1 test away from graduation  ;o)
"it is official    i am done with school, i officially have my degree  holla"
"12 hour days are no fun, i am beat    but i will be happy when the paycheck comes"
i am officially confused when it comes to the mating rituals of heterosexual couples!?!?

i really hate when guys pretend to be good guys and get you to crush on them    and then turn out to be jerks
the new <propfemale> <propfirst> album is phenomenal!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"thanks <propfirst>, <propfemale>, and raime for all the parts for my vault  i am finally at 5 stars    it is greatly appreciated"

if i wanted a play by play of the game    i would watch the damn thing myself
"got some yard work done, cooked dinner, and spent the day laying around with the pussies    cinnamon and <propfemale> are spoiled rotten but i love them  ;o)"
"thanks all for the birthday wishes    and thank to <propfemale>, <propfemale>, <propmale>, <propfemale>, avani, sherrilyn, and <propfirst> for the fun times after work    xoxo"

"is it just me or is it weird when porn stars have no problem with showing their goods, but more times than not are wearing shoes??? hmmmmmmm"
i love the new <propfemale> <propfirst> video!!!!!!!! she is phenomenal
so apparently i am a glutton for punishment    i went with <propfemale> to the animal shelter today so she could adopt a cat and somehow she went home with none and i ended up coming home with 2 more    that means i now own 4 cats     what the hell is a gay guy supposed to do with that much pussy??????
"ok, so i took the shelter collars off the girls today   <propfemale> and <propfemale> have a home   "
i hate being sick    
gotta love that that half of second shift in the radiology department called in today because of food poisening    at least now i know why i am sick    happy tech week to me
so let me tell you    having food poisening is proving to be one of the best diets i have ever been on  ;o(
"all the pussies are getting along, and even starting to play with each other    thankfully we are back to having a happy household"
"ok so i am done    every time i try to bake it ends up a disaster; it is either burnt, or raw in the middle, or just down right nasty    see mom this is why you should have gotten me that easy bake oven i asked for for christmas when i was twelve"
<propfemale> and <propfemale> are getting more affectionate by the day     beginning to think they weren't loved where they came from    <propfemale> and cinnamon are taking to them quite well too    just gotta get <propfemale> and <propfemale> used to cinnamon's aggressive style of play  ;o)
so i had my tree up for less than 5 hours before one of the cats ate through the cord to the lights     also my heat in my car went out while i was on my way to my parents    if this is any indication of how this holiday is gonna be for me i am screwed
hey mafia friends   need wedding cakes and burners    please click the links on my <propfemale>  ;o)
i don't know which i hate more    comcast or zynga
so for the third time in about 10 days my internet it slower than a snail at a little after 8    i hate comcast
"i just really need a get-away   like i want to hibernate for about a month, no work, no drama, no stress, just sleep and peace"
now normally i love the smell of gasoline    but i am kind of opposed to it on me after snow blowing the driveway    hmmm    off to take a shower  so fresh and so clean clean
ok so seriously    farmville needs to release the coin 28x28 upgrade    my farm looks like it is from an episode of horders
"off to work i go     now lets set some ground rules people; no shooting each other because <propfemale> didn't give you what you wanted, don't stab your girlfriends cause you caught her kissing <propfemale> claus, no driving like assholes, and just because you don't believe in christmas doesn't mean you should come to the er today because you have had a cough for a month    thanks"
"<propfemale> christmas to all, and to all a goodnight"

"<propfemale> is my god!!!!!   the show was phenomenal, makes up for the fact that i was up $300 and managed to lose it all ;o(  at least i am at the break even point at the moment"
"lucky luck was quite the fickle bitch to me today ,   so much for being up   lets pray tomorrow is a better day for me"
"so after all is said and done     i lost about $400 in vegas  ;o(   who wants to be my sugar daddy?? i'll even take a sugar mommy, just no sex   he he"

"i would much rather the people at farmville get off their asses and release the farm e playful ansion, and worry less about bringing farmville to another country or coming up with hybrid seeds     just a thought"
just got home from seeing black swan     talk about a mind fuck
so do you need to have a doctor's note if you want to check yourself into the psych <propmale> for a little r&r??
i am beginning to think it is time to restructure my life again   
i love love love the new <propfemale> spears video for hold it against me
"depression is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long  put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression  will you do it, and leave it on your status for at least an hour? most people won't, but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives  show your support  i copied and pasted, will you?"
my head hurts ;o(
so i went to the grocery store planning on buying about $50 or so in groceries and somehow managed to walk out of there spending $130    what the hell
nothing like homemade turkey chili on a cold and shitty day  yum   
"just watched paranormal activity 2    started off pretty slow, but wholly shit did it get scary"
guess i am gonna try to head to bed     damn you daylight savings time
i really hate being sick  ;o(
"ok so here is how it is    i can be an incredible friend or the biggest bitch you have ever seen     so if you think i am a bitch you obviously did something to cross me, and i revel making stupid people cry    you have been warned ;o)"
i love thunderstorms  ;o)
"ok so what the hell is the point of having 2 farm on farmville if you can't use them both???  lame zynga, really lame"
sticks and stones may break my bones     but chains and whips excite me  ;o)
