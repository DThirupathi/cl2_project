"a\ true friend doesn't care when you're broke,  being an @ss, what you \weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive,  about your past, or if \your family is filled with crazy people  your  conversations pick up \where they left off, even if they have been months  apart  they love \   you   for who you are  re-post if you have    at  lea   st one true \friend  they will know who they are                "
"you got a pretty even-keeled head on\ your shoulders  youâ€™re well-grounded and realistic  you donâ€™t really \daydream or think about the future (unless youâ€™re planning ahead, of \course)  actually, you tend to find day-dreaming and flightiness pretty \annoying and pointless  sometimes people get you confused for being \pessimistic, but you know that youâ€™re just being real "
