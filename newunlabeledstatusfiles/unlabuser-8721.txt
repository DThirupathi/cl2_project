everyone is starting to think that it is all bush's fault and to stop blaming obama  i think that we should give credit where it's due and blame obama for where he screws up and blame bush only for what he did instead of actions that obama started his term with

"it has been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy   but you will always love them   re-post if you have at least one of these friends"
