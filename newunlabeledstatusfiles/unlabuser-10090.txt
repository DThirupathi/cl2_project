"there comes a point in your life when fun no longer means bar hopping, clubbing, being out till 4am or drinking too much  it means movies, family dinners, kids athletic events, bedtime stories and 9pm bedtimes  becoming a parent doesn't change you, it makes you realize that the little people you created deserve the best of your free time!"
"no matter what happens, no matter what obstacles are thrown our way, together with the love of family and friends we will conquer all without hesitation  beyond words for how grateful i am to have the people in my life that i do   smile "
