there will always be circumstances in life     its our attitude and how we choose to deal with them that can make it easy or hard 
each day allows you to begin again  as you wake remind urself that your future is not yet written  you have the ability to make it what you will 
girls got school tomorrow and don't wanna lay down! whoopin ass time  lol
it's hard to stay positive when nothing ever goes right!
 sad 
i hate when kids bring home math homework!!! i can do it just they don't get it no matter how much you try to show them    
"life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass  it's about learning to dance in the rain! learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow "
happiness or unhappiness is often a matter of choice
"don't ever think your nothing because somewhere along the line, there's gonna be someone who thinks your everything    "
tomorrow is gonna be the best day ever! can't wait   
damn it's snowin'!!
gettin ready to go out with my girl   fun!
 smile 
good day so far!

foot is swollen like crazy now and trying to walk is more difficult    this sucks!
signed the girls up for girl scouts! hope they enjoy it    
things are beginning to fall into place   finally!
sometimes in the winds of change we find our true direction   
without obstacles how would you ever know what you are capable of?
