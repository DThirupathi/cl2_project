"enjoys marking ads for <propfirst> brown as offensive   it started as irrelevant, but now he's absolutely fed up   really    does facebook need to rub it into his face that he is an ohio resident, not a massachusetts one?"

"thinks that buying an add on facebook for one's college council bid is not conducive for winning over the    oh    practical-spending-minded and or socialist vote   while he agrees with several of comrade hikel's policies, this is absolutely ridiculous   vote    <propmale> f    for college council   we don't have a platform, but we know what not to do "
"hates <propfirst>'s day   if you want to give him a <propfirst>, make it a chinese new year present instead   he thinks chinese new year is awesome and far superior to the bloody, lovey-dovey, ridiculously pink greeting-card holiday   yes, he is bitter   you'd be too if you were in his place "
"is sick of kissy-faces   you do not need to eat each other's lips in public   i don't care if today is chinese new year; that is not a valid excuse   oh, it's <propfirst>'s day?  then go get married illegally and come back and talk to me then   thanks, and bye "
