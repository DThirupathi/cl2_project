"it is not a question of god allowing or not allowing things to happen  it is part of living  some things we do to ourselves, other things we do to each other  our father knows about every bird which falls to the ground, but he does not always prevent it from falling  our response to what happens is more important than what happens "
"alone in this house again tonight, i got the tv on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine  there is pictures of me and you on the walls around me        i've never been the kind to let my feelings show  i thought that being strong meant never losing self control  but im just drunk enough to let go of my pain, to hell with my pride, let it fall like rain from my eyes  tonight i wanna cry "
"get to work and told i can't clock in on time  on our champs checks, somebody left a commet about me and i have no idea who they are  then this old guy comes in and knows my entire life story and what im doing with my life  then tells me how lucky malachi melton is for marrying to most gorgeous woman alive  next comes a smashed finger  and to top it all off i dumped the mop water all over the floor "
what a day                       ergh               certain people need to just leave me the flip alone       how did you get my number anyways? hopefully tonight goes a little better than my day went       
thinks tonight is going to be an early night    
"okay, this is getting really out of hand  i'm tired of playing games  lose my number and just get me out of your life  i'm getting married and your not getting pictures  what part of that dont you understand? just leave me alone  for good  not just till you see me at work or you somehow get my number and act like everything is okay then cause i have to talk to you while im on the clock    urgh    "

"well, everything is almost packed away      fixing to start moving stuff around       gosh moving day seems so much farther away not that im prepared for it     "
"i have alot i need to say, and alot i want to say    just one problem    idk when to say it, or even how to say it for that matter     "
"if i had a single flower for every time i think about you, i could walk forever in my garden   ~claudia ghandi i love you malachi melton"
"what a day, what a day     my eyes hurt, heart aches,got you upset with me, floors almost cleaned, sweat drippin like the tears from my eyes    hopefully i can turn this day around    r i p  bubba  you will be greatly missed  you are better off now    no more suffering    "

thinking about some of the things going on in life right now     its really hard dealing with it all         i feel as if im invisible     
"how great is our god? sing with me how great is our god, and all will sing, how great, how great is our go  (oh and fyi, my cell phone was shut off, so if you need to get ahold of me contact me on facebook or house phone )"
"this is my temporary home, not where i belong  windows and rooms like im passing through  this is just a stop on the way to where im going     "
is in need of prayer      
"so glad that facebook is the way we all communicate  a phone call never hurts here and there      ugh         love finding things going on, on facebook it really helps me feel the love       "

"a veteran is someone who at one point in their life wrote a blank check payable to the usa for an amount up to and including their life  that is beyond honor and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that  copy and paste this as your status if you are a veteran, know a veteran, love a veteran or support the troops"

"happy thanksgiving to all  hope you all had a good one  i spent most of mine in bed      had a little turkey but not much     slept alot today and ready for bed, after i finish talking to malachi  smile "
13 days   
"whenever you find the time, call me  i might answer  whenever your bored, text me  i may have time to text back    "
is thinking its about bed time    
"thinks this is awesome  8 days to go and i get to be with malachi again  only thing is, is that im already having problems sleeing because im to excited  trying to get as much packed as i can  but i know there is going to be something i forget  o well there are many wal-marts out there  surely i can convince him to take me to one of them  wink "
"put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a ku fan ( malachi melton ) being a jayhawk fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously  there is still no known cure for being a jayhawk fan and sympathy does not help, but we can raise awareness  100% of ksu fans will repost this simply because we know how to copy and paste, as well as tie our shoes! eat 'em up, eat 'em up k-s-u! go state!"
"getting tired of the head games, and lies      tell me the truth the first time      its going to make things much easier in the long run     "
some things will never change           
i wish i had the remote from the movie click          
six days and im gone    hopefully everything goes as planned and we get a place to live    would be so amazing to just get away from all the stupid things this town brings into my life     ready to live my happy life with malachi melton and start everything all over again     
got alot of stuff today      waiting for <propfemale> to get home so i can bring it all inside        hopefully i can find the room in my bedroom to store it all       then again though i dont want to look at it all the time    might be tempted to use it       hoping things turn around for my evening     if not its going to be a long night              
"its going to be a long long long day       doctor in an hour, work at three, finishing up on my packing  <propfemale> having baby boy today  i leave really early in the morning  not feeling the greatest  still really nervous about flying  ugh so much to do in so little time!"
less than six hoours to go      i can feel my stomach twisting    nervous as heck    
is waitn on him to come home  starting to feel better  its warmer here than n kansas but its still kinda cold  went roaming around last night with malachi and determind that i don't feel safe driving and i will get lost so fast out here 
"i may not be the most beautiful girl or the sexiest girl nor do i have the perfect body  i might not be everyone's first choice, but i am a good one  i do not pretend to be someone i'm not, because i am good at being me  i might not be proud of some of the things in my past, but i am proud of who i am today! so take me    as i am  or watch me as i walk away! re-post if you are proud of being you smile "
tears have already started pouring out  this really sucks  the time out here was wonderful  met some really cool people  had alot of fun with malachi  so not ready to say goodbye tomorrow though       its going to be harder than it was in june                         
thinks its funny how some people are heart broken by going a few hours or a couple days without seeing their loved ones      why dont you suck it up and live in someone elses shoes for awhile  i'm so sick of hearing about it    you really have no idea what its like to miss someone                     
why?                         
"looking back through all the pictures, i love everything i had, and still have today  all the smiles and laughs shared  can't wait to see what the future holds, and how many more smiles are left to come  how many more hours of laughter are yet to come  the fun dates we have  baby i hope you know how much i love and miss you "
is having computer problems                   
is thinking i dont know how much more i can take      
this is getting better and better by the second           fmfl       
its whatever              rough day       back is killing me              thinking its time to relax a little      
another rough night at work     i think that i just need to curl up in a ball and stay in bed      maybe that would solve all the problems                
"stress, stress, stress     what is a little more? what could it hurt? so much stuff to do, but yet so little time to have it all done by        "
19 days              sad 
"dogs are going nuts tonight       with everything that has been goin on, i'm almost afraid to go outside     "
31 days exactly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and the bet is on      who will win? malachi melton  has to run 100 <propmale> by the time we get married  who thinks he can do that? or do that plus more? lets see what this little runner has left in him  and to spice it up a bit i will also throw in my smoking habit to be stopped cold turkey the day he comes back for the wedding if he has 80+ <propmale> under his belt  let me know who u think will win!!!!
"stress, stress, stress, stress, stress            "
