put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  our wish is that people will understand being gay is not a disease or a choice  people who are gay are not looking for a cure  they are looking for acceptance and equal rights  93% won't copy and paste this     will you   make it your status for at least one hour?

really enjoyed my evening    made me feel better and at the same time sad  in the end it will all work out  smile 
there is never a good time to tell someone they are the cause of your current frustrations and that they have hurt you agian    
frustrated that you ask me to be involved but whenever i say anything  the response i get is well that's your opinion  don't pretend that you want my opinion if it never matters 
"thought i was doing well, just cried for 40 pages straight    crazy how books can really connect with you "
can't wait to go back home! even if i will freeze my ass off 
feels better already 
some dumbass just backed into the side of my car  both front and back doors are all dented and scratched  just my luck 
shitty day may be looking up
