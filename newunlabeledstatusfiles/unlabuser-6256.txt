you cut me deep badgers   you cut me deep 
"all these asphyxiated, self-medicated, take the white pill you'll feel alright "
it's not being heartless if you don't actually know the person   that's just indifference 
arggggggg 
(something clever and witty here that describes my dissatisfaction)
bamboozled
needs to find a job 
still looking for a job     or a sugar daddy

if i barely know you and we never talk why wouldn't i delete you off facebook?  don't act like i just kicked your dog   
"so here's an idea         oh wait, it's gone "

a good time for a life change    
hey facebook- i liked you better when you didn't try to tell me how to run my profile   maybe there is a reason i'm not reconnecting with a certain person 
dear bp -  please remove head from ass!
"in february of 2009, bp declared it is â€œunlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill will occur due to the distance to the shore (48 <propmale>) and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts are e playful ected \ - anybody wondering about why this \""unlikely\"" occurance is still raging in the gulf of mexico please copy and paste to your profile """
looking forward to a weekend with my sisters in <propfemale>!
is finally moving to florida 
so apparently bp has an eleven year old board member    this must be the person thinking up ways to fix the gulf oil spill 
doesn't want to feel feelings anymore 
i am artemis
t-minus twenty days til i leave for florida and the line between excitement and sadness is growing very thin    
bull pucky!
hurting in more ways than one today   
don't you understand? i already have a plan   i'm waiting for my real life to begin 
"farewell menomonie, thanks for the memories "
here's to your journey in life 
and when your fears subside and the shadows still remain i know that you can love me when there's no one else to blame 
woke up in wisconsin but will fall asleep in nashville   then palm trees and hopefully white beaches 
"finds the bible belt more horrifying than <propfirst>, indiana  how can there be more churches in a town than people?"
hello florida   
shed a tear cuz i'm missing you   i'm still okay to smile 
"come what may, i will not fold "
"breath in, breath out     repeat "
fingers crossed that life might start to fall into place today 
"a big shiny boxes and tar balls, might have to bitch slap el presidente when he shows up on my beach tomorrow   maybe that will give someone some motivation to do something "
may the love hidden deep inside your heart find the love waiting in your dreams  may the laughter that you find in your tomorrow wipe away the pain you find in your yesterdays 
got a job and a condo all in the same day   life is good today 
starts work today    finally   
"damn you tar balls, i had hoped you might not show    "
"dear bp,  go to hell   thanks "
anybody else find it slightly coincidental that <propfirst> hayward of bp looks an awful lot like mr  burns off the simpsons?
sometimes feels like the world stopped spinning but i'm still running in circles    
physically and mentally drained at the moment
"really misses family and friends, but starting to feel better about life "
um    bored
ok   beer and hot tub 
can't sleep    
"sleep, evading me again    "
moving into my new place today!

"work another double today, then tomorrow i'm on a boat!"
"work, work, and more work    having a life is over rated anyway "
"sleep, apparently we have become enemies "
not sure why i ever thought a florida dmv would be any less infuriating than the rest of them 
overtired   
would rather spend her day on the beach today 
would like to not feel tired   just once 
"to bed at five, awake at 8, working a double   fml   the next two days off better be bliss "
"baby don't worry about a thing, cuz every little thing is gonna be alright "
has decided whoever invented romance movies should be beaten   i call bullshit 
no words for the mood i'm in

"i can't tell you what it is, i can only tell you what it feels like"
thinks these planes look questionable at best    annoyed 
finding out she is not a fan of flying on small planes 
didn't realize how much i missed home 
can't sleep    excited for the weekend 
rain rain go away     seriously
misses people already 
breath in   breath out    
craving   
"if you blame others for your failures, do you credit others for your successes?"
the secret to <propfemale> is occupying your mind in the meantime 
profoundly happy right now
today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday
day at the beach   so great!
thinking tomorrow is going to be another beach day   i love living by the ocean!
holy jellyfish!
"hey my longhorn peeps, anybody wanna pick up tomorrow night?"
"dear work, i hate that you are a necessity of life"
"dear sleep,  your evasiveness has become an annoyance   please take note "
good night for a glass of wine and painting outside
um    yellow?
88 and beautiful    pool time!
"dear mr  slug, are those wings real?  or have i been fooled by paper mache    "
"happiness can rarely be given, but is always willing to be found "
oh blah 
so very wore out    
i like to think romance really did exist once   all these sappy movies had to come from a root inspiration   who's brave enough to bring it back?

flawless logic
"live life intensly, embrace that you are unrepeatable, love everyday   transend "
maybe the first time in my life that i'm upset about having a weekend off
our restlessness is largely due to the fact that we are still wanderers between two worlds  transcend 
hoping this month flies by 
looking for a few good leavers  the takers have become tiresome 
in desperate need of intellectual stimulation 
feel like i'm going insane tonight   where did all this damn anxiety come from?

i'm so excited about this week its almost unhealthy 
such a good day!
"dear facebook, you bore me "
last night with sister  sad 
missing lil sis already 
wants to live in a <propmale> potter movie   is that really so wrong!
on a hunt for the ugliest sweater in pcb 
i don't lie    i believe invalid truths 
you may say that i'm a dreamer but i'm not the only one
hey you    
   
reality is a collective hunch 
in a strange mood   
today it has become painfully obvious that i'm getting much too old for all nighters 
"why is it so cold?  come on sunshine state, time to shine here   "
"2 bottles of wine, vampire weekend on repeat, and kicking roommates butt at cribbage   it's a good night "
is ready for a revolution 
it's not too late to feel a little more alive   make an escape before we start to vaporize 
it is peculiar to mankind to transcend mankind   it is also peculiar to run naked through the streets but who hasn't done that 
"so let me get this straight bp    if you were unemployed the last 12 months you get a ten thousand dollar check, but if you work 30 to 40 hours a week and show a loss from last year you get nothing   awesome  once again, go to hell "
lookin sick and sexified!  lbd night!
"dear sleep, you punish me in such cruel and unusual ways "
thinking softly what a tinder box we live in    and what a flammable heart i've been given 
"dear immune system, what's with all the hate?"
"once upon a time, like 5 years ago, i knew this dude named <propfemale>   he was from the projects   "
appreciative of skype today   missing the family a whole lot 
"we can go out of sound, you and me for a while "
"i am shiva, watch me dance "
"free and able, you won't change until you want to   but i feel it coming"
here comes the feeling you thought you'd forgotten    
i'd be lying if i said i understood your logic 
i'm sexy like an onion
"we are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
i yearn for more in life than just a <propmale> to feed at the trough where the world is being devoured 
no special control is needed to make people into pyramid builders if they think they have no choice but to build pyramids   i'm tired of dragging two ton stones
"revolution is not about eliminating people, its about walking away and never looking back "
you never change things by fighting the existing reality 
"we are all both angels and demons at once  the demons are not ugly, we must befriend them to know and control them  make peace with them, make peace with life "
    
time for a roadtrip
"dear state of florida, a singular highway sign ten feet before said highway does not count as a directional resource "
with your feet in the air and your head on the ground
all that i'm after is a life full of laughter 
"let's see who strikes the loudest, put on my fighting trousers!"
don't mistake me for a heartbreaker  i'm simply just a heart taker  not my fault these boys fall like dominos 
this again? really?

"\oh sigorne weaver lull me to awesomeness and teach me of our world!\"" (<propfemale>'s reaction to seeing planet earth playing on discovery)"""
"pleased to meet you hope you guessed my name, oh but what's confusing you is just the nature of my game "
where is my mind?
don't be ninja-in nobody that don't need ninja-in
shove that in your google hole and search it!
i've upped my standards   up yours 
"when in doubt, always do whatevers next "
"green and yellow, green and yellow, green and yellow, green and yellow   "
i'm crackin eggs of wisdom!
"have you ever wondered if the person in the mirror is real, and you're just a reflection of them?"
"go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence "
"dear sleep, this is your last warning  i demand cooperation or things are going to get ugly   you've been warned "
life becomes e playful onentially better when you add your own soundtrack 
"dear <propfirst>'s day, i still find you to be a mind numbingly stupid holiday "
"dear friends and family, i have estimated i am now only receiving 30% of my texs   so if i'm not responding to you its cuz i'm not getting them "
"\i kinda want a cigarette \""  \""if i have an ounce of alcohol in me i need a hooker\"""""
thinking softly what a concrete mess we live in   
"dear wisconsin, i'm coming to see you "
let me not follow the clamor of the world but walk calmly in my path 
73 degrees and <propfemale>   i love where i live!
would rather be on the beach than working a double   
coincidence is the world we use when we can't see the lever and pulleys 
   
what if this wasn't a hypothetical question?
my life has a strong cast but i can't figure out the plot 
"dear sleep, so we play the hate game now   i see how you are    "
"strange as it may seem, my life is based on a true story "
on some adventures with <propfirst>!  watch out pcb   
egypt    the pyramid state 
it's not easy taking life's problems one at a time when they refuse to get in line 
what to do   
sometimes i sit wondering where my mind wanders   
"dear weather, please hold out so i can have at least one day on the beach "
wait for it   
i think it's offically spring break in pcb    if i see one more neon pink trucker hat i may punch someone   this might be a long season   
"â€œ if you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there â€�"
lmfao concert   oh shit son!
some days make more sense than others  today seems rather nonsensical   
when life gives you lemons grab a bottle of vodka and enjoy 
if you maintain eye contact with me i may bite

"you know what, i am a roller coaster rider!  i admit it "
this is the past that somebody in the future is longing to go back to 
"â€œwhat the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly â€�"
thinkin beach today   
pretty sure that every spring breaker in pcb drove here individually 
getting excited for my vaca home!
"dear frozen tundra, be gentle with me   my blood has thinned "
"dear sleep, if you were my facebook friend i would delete you right now "
if your partial to the night sky   if your vaguely attracted to rooftops   
"hey, how about you do something while your doing nothing "
rabble rousers!
it's a zen day 
headed back to pcb   oh how i missed the beach 
probably going to be working on my off switch tonight   
roomie moves today  sad   guess i'm ridin solo now
