"12- i've known you since 4th grade, and the fact that you gave me the nickname i hate the worst i will never forgive you :b haha you are still one of my best friends though, but still you will be, never forgiven!!"
"this is the last one\77- i've known you for 5 years and you are like a brother to me  we don't talk much anymore which makes me pretty sad  i know your birthday is in 5 days  and for some reason i laughed when i saw you chose the number that you did  i forgot that that is your number for everything "
