trying my hardest not to even care anymore  but love makes you do stupid and crazy things 
i guess this shot  was out of defense? either way it goes    i still got nicked 
really wants everything to work out for the best  please god please
don't over promise and then under deliver
so what's up facebook  haven't been on in a while
i'm so <propfemale> tired
sad all over again
"i can't keep up with your turning tables\under your thumb, i can't breathe\so i won't let you close enough to hurt me, no\i won't ask you, you to just desert me\i can't give you what you think you gave me\it's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables\next time i'll be braver, i'll be my own savior\when the thumb that cost me\next time i'll be braver, i'll be my own savior\standing on my own two feet"
and you wonder why
good morning world

really wishes you would understand
i'm done trying brought to you by the letter c

sometimes i wonder what to wonder about you 
i'm on the edge with you 
what you thinking about 
hopes for the best
