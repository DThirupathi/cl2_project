most awkward moment of my life  today on the airplane i was sitting by this cute guy who is going to texas tech for baseball  i fell asleep and woke up laying on his arm     then proceeded to pretend that nothing happened  yay me 
has never been more thankful to be off a plane and back home   i may feel awful but at least i'm away from whatever i'm allergic to
