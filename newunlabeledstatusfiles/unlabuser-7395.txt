"big game for the texans today   i think they got a good <propmale> to get the help they need to make the playoffs, assuming they beat the playoffs   with that said, crush em patriots!  sorry <propmale>, my sports loyalties tell me to stick with the pats no mater what   the best i can say is that i feel slightly dirty about this "
"congrats texans!  what a weird game, and i think <propmale> <propmale> is going to need to put in some work to regain his rep as the best closer in football    he's been abmissmol this year   it's also disguisting watching my dad whoop around the room, and scream hit him!!!!!! at <propmale>   *shakes head in shame* "
"blown away again, how god comes through exactly when you need him, and just how he does it "
"despite some extreme down moments, i'm getting by with a little help from my friends (as the poet once said), and slowly putting the pieces together "
first thought on seeing the thunder last night: i'm gonna walk to bk and get me an oreo shake 
"is tired of this mickey-mouse crap, and is going to take back control "
"getting ready to go to <propfirst> for the weekend, please pray we're able to represent the lord well!"
"my, the facebook friend group is growing!  <propfirst> was a sweet time, met quite a few good people on the trip and tried to just be a servant as much as possible   would love to keep up with this sort of work   also randomly before the trip, the much talked about saxophone finally became a reality! yeah <propmale> "
"gotta say, that despite being packed with tests, and that my phone got wrecked this has been a great week   meeting cool people is always a good thing, and quite a few have entered my life recently   thanks guys!"
just pulled off the upset of this young century on my speech midterm   add that with the events of monday and you've got one intriguing week so far 
"man, i get so worked up sometimes about what's going on or what's not going on, then god reminds me of who he is and than i remember i don't have to worry about the future so much because he's got it under control   just wish i could always remember that   the possibilities are endless with god guilding the way "
sunday afternoon   pats are on the t v  in their old school jerseys and it's snowing   this is nice 
"oh yes, yeah maybe it's the 0-5 titans    but with how great the patriots are playing (in the snow no less)    i think the patriots are back   4 tds in one quater by <propfirst> b    don't be so mean <propmale>!"
"oh excuse me, make that 5 tds!!!   nfl record   you keep on doing what you do <propmale>"
"the whole desrosiers clan is in <propmale> till thursday, oh yes, thanksgiving has come early "
"many decisions have been made over the last week regarding my future    well the next 6 months or so, which is how i operate   i'm proud to claim my decisions, as my own and look forward making the most out of hbu houston till the summertime   on another note, it was a great time with the fam "
duke v s  hbu (or hb according to espn)     hmmmmm   got to hope for the best because man i hate duke! bring em on 
"    and duke pulls  out a nail biter: 104-35   oh the carnage, keep your head up girls!"
"after going blind reading up on the celtics for a speech next week, i'm ready for tonight's football game   pats-colts to the death   always a classic "
     i'm going to be sick
"all bandaged up from giving blood   it's a good cause so i'm always down with helping out    plus there were free cookies   that ut t-shirt on the other hand, is probably never going to be worn, even on laundry day "
"about this pats-saints game   yeah my team is down 14 but i'm cool with it, got no problems with the saints and just wanted to see what they got   definitely a good team no matter how this thing ends  <propfirst> brees and that offense is sick "
"hats off to the saints, i'm not sure when the last time i saw the patriots so badly outplayed   that was dominating  definitely want them to represent the nfc in the super bowl   with all due respect to my old comrade <propfirst> on the dwc, my hatred of <propmale> farve is yankee, and lakeresque "
"was going to write here summing up the last couple of days, but ran out of space and than switched to a long note posting   needless to say, it's been a cool few days!"
"looking better than i hoped gong into the finals   three class grades are set in stone, with two up for grabs inclduing the speech class   if it's still on the table, i'm going to snatch it "
"aced my psyc test, and final speech, got a fatter pay check than e playful ectedâ€¦ and itâ€™s snowing   yes, itâ€™s a good day in <propmale> "
"test one is in the bag (frustrating but irrelevent), with number 2 up in half an hour (piece of cake), after that it gets fun   hope everyone enjoyed the baugh last night night!"
"crushed the last two finals to the degree that an a may still be possible for rev history (long shot    but still)   we'll see if that prayer group comes together at 8   after that it's studing for the speech test tommorow, than getting reaquainting with my pillow   it's been a long 24 hours but we're pulling through!"
"    so i went out for prayer and ended up swing dancing, who knew?"
"alright, feel like i did what i needed to on that speech final   only psyc left to go   this is actually the one i care the most about and will simultaniously be the easiest hardest one   it's friday at 10:45 so i have almost two days too focus on it alone   this ride is almost over!"
"left the door open with the psyc test   it was definitely as tough as i feared  oh well,  i don't see the teacher snatching away an a if i kept it close (which i did)   in any case, the semester is over and now it's time to go get the best meal of my life and bowl with <propfirst>   the break is here!"
hummm     that last day went a little different than planned (but still good)   been laying low at the folks house for the last few days   driving test tommorow!  and christmas shopping is done in record time   hope everyone else is doing well 
95ed the written test and had the fingers crossed on dodging the bullet of needing a driving test (that one back in the day took me out twice)   no such luck   the license awaits another day after i please some texas ranger with my rustly as all heck driving skills    just need to fool him once!  i think i can do it 
"grades are in   it started off ugly like none other but ended strong and the grades reflex it: 3 as and 2 bs good for a 3 6    i'm not sure i ever did that at ccbc where all the classes were strictly bible, and that's something i'd studied for years   yeah i'll take this     what an interesting 12 months "
"alright, worked on the driving skills with the family so it's now down to actually passing this thing tomorrow   no worries   pops is going to owe me a free meal for this "
"look out world, <propmale> has a driver's license"
"<propfemale> christmas! hope everyone is having a great day, and gets to spend it with loved ones "
"rode around <propmale> looking for the galleria mall   should have took 20 minutes, but went closer to 2 hours   whatever, i'm rolling again   thanks again go out to my sister-in-law for the wheels, and my brother for being the reason i haven't died yet "
just when i thought i couldn't possiblly hate <propmale> pollard anyone more than i already did   
"man do i know campus a lot better now   much love to financial aid, and student life "
    should have worn my rondo jersey tonight!
"really, not that i care for texas football (though i hate <propmale> saban and therefor alabama) but man do i feel sorry for that kid qb they have in now "
"45 minutes till game time   ravens are a good team, and the pats have definitely been better, but i honestly never feel the patriots are in trouble with the playoffs, they get it done   monster in the fridge for this one "
i don't know where to begin with that game   brutialized by the run to the point the ravens qb can win with a 10 rating    and be the better quaterback?  revolting   this whole team from the coach on down needs to get theirs butts straightened out if they ever want to get back to the super bowl   sickening   rondo getting a triple double for the celtics doesn't mellow me out at all after what the patriots did today 
for anyone who is interested we'll be having a time of prayer tonight in the parlor room at 7 smile 0 p m  all are welcome!
about astronomy   
it's <propfirst> bauer time!
"so what's the set-up so far, old ctu v s  new ctu?  not really impressed by anything so far (except drucker from heat running ctu) but it's early   tomorrow will be nice with <propfemale> <propmale> jumping into the fray we're going to need her character "
"the book of <propmale>, worth checking out "
"i've hated <propmale> farve since the 97 superbowl, but i got to admit he won my respect by getting the crap kicked out of him all game and yet chugging along   little bummed the way the game ended for him, but what symmetry   just don't take 4 months to decide what your going to do, o k ?"
prayer tonight in the lake house parlor room for anyone who is interested   it starts at 7 smile 0 p m   god bless 
worlds have collided:  <propmale> from the old ccbc days has now moved in with me at my parent's place in texas   this will be interesting 
"getting tired of seeing the celtics blow 2nd half leads   sadly, i am happy they lost all three of these important games, instead of going 1-2   it's good to bottom out to let you know you need to change   stinks that a beautiful game by rondo was wasted "
"good to see the celtics stepping their game up as of late   love'n tutoring at the elementary school each day   doing some esl work and i think that will be the joy of my morning   everyone is from a different country and has their own style   as someone who has done a little traveling in my day, this is extremely exciting!"
"well that celtics game was terrible   bring on the super bowl!  gotta give respect to peyton, but i'm solidly in the saints corner   sure they didn't look good 2 weeks ago, but anyone that can tear the patriots apart the way they did is a team that knows how to play   do it for new orleans "
"way to go saints!!  utterly dominated that second quater onward   as a pats fan it was awesome seeing the old peyton in the 4th quater, and knowing our status as team of the decade has been protected   awesome game new orleans!!!"
"just caught the latest episode of 24   loved the knife work with <propfemale> and <propfirst>   overall it seems this season's pace has been really slow and the stoires weak   <propfemale> has been the only interesting character, everyone at ctu is forgetable, i have no love for the president or her staff, and the bad guys haven't done anything in weeks    man do i miss <propfirst> <propmale> and his crew "
"just got back from <propmale>   i was there over spring break with a crew from hbu partnering with the center for student missions   awesome, awesome trip   much love to csm who are helping all sorts of people and organizations in need   e playful ect a note in the next few days, but man did god do some work this week!"
"quitely hit the 100 friend <propfirst> (thanks <propmale>)   will be interesting to look at the break down of where everyone is, and where we met "
eating at chipotles with a crew from the bible college in california!?!?  god does weird stuff sometimes   i love it 
<propfirst> <propmale> is going to the basketball hall of fame!  bout freaking time 
"saturday service project at hbu   among other things is serving the homeless, visiting nursing homes, assisting food banks, and so on   o k  huskies: let's see some of christ's love!"
"sigh, the double down â€œsandwichâ€� from kfc broke my heart today   overpriced, and nothing special "
season 8 of 24 reminds me of the disappoint i felt when i failed first grade 
"got to admit, i felt like a million bucks today at piney point   i think my kids are ready for the taks test on monday, and i got a lot of love from their teacher in appreciation (including $30 to starbucks) "
is wondering why what should be easy is never easy 
"sweet day thanks to x, and also financial aid-- it's to the point where i actually love talking with the people at financial aid since good stuff always happen   freaky "
"what a day, nearly missed my poly sci final and then had a steel caged match with a sociology one a little later   it was like a bad dream   but everything else in the day was simply awesome  huskies: don't forget you can donate old stuff by bringing it--preferably in a bag, to the front lobby of your dorm residence   <propfirst> hinnenkamp and <propfirst> moss will handle the rest   much respect to those guys and my pops "
"farewell semester number 3   very interesting ride this time around and was able to settle into a nice grove   got involved, <propmale> out with teachers (that's never happened before), and loved tutoring at piney point   nice development all the way around!  but now it's off to cali on thursday   any huskies that are interested in doing a one-way road trip let me know "
ra-jon rondooooooooooo!!!!!
"1500 <propmale> to cali and a full tank of gas   the trip begins tomorrow morning, hopfully ending around 9 pm friday with me at twin peaks   let's make it happen!"
settled into tucson for the night   2 3 of the way there! god bless the hammer <propfirst> 
"it took 1500 <propmale> but i'm back at twin peaks   i love the crew up here, it's going to be an awesome summer   there are few places like california!"
"for those who know what one of the main reasons for my coming back to cali for the summer are, it's a big no go   it went down a couple days ago and i'm 95% cool with everything, god is going to work it out and in many ways this makes sense   that other 5% of me is going to need a while to sort though all the implications "
"celtics-lakers round 12   l a , get ready to be rondo'd"
"well that game sucked, couldn't have been more disappointing all around   the d was charmin soft, both allens were in foul trouble and kg was atrocious  the celtics will be better in game 2, because they simply can't get much worse   the fire will be there on sunday "
lazy sunday   it'll either be church or game 2 tonight   tomorrow will be good for job hunting studying    really need something to develop there 
"celtics convert the split!  missed the game to go to church     but god rewarded that with a rondo triple-double (and sick block), plus 8 3pts by jesus shuttlesworth   i'm loving this "
"what a frustating team, probably should have seen that coming   now i have to wear a lakers jersey, and sat through hours of abuse from a lakers crowd   still, they have to win two more times before it's all over   and atleast kg came alive again    now about mr  jesus shuttlesworth "
"alright!  on top of the side gig, i was informed today by the pastor up here that they'll hire me for three days a week, besides room and board   this is a huge turn a round for the summer "
"  and the good news keeps a rolling: csm has my application and a phone interview will be taking place shortly   if that goes well, the next step is to go to la and be a shadow city host for a week   these are the things i imagined for the summer   oh, and the celtics won yesterday   the only thing that went wrong is i didn't buy a lottery ticket, could have been a millionaire with the hot streak i'm on "
"looking forward to tomorrows game   up 3-2 going back to la where we need to win 1    i'd be shocked if the celtics don't get this done   remember what rondo did in game 6 in 08?  e playful ect that again, especially with bynum all jacked up "
game 7 = war time   this will be biblical 
"as per the bet, here is what everyone has been waiting for   on the plus side, it took the guys forever to come up with a shirt (some fans they are)   the man in this photo is <propfirst> <propmale>, a friend i've known for like 5 years, we met at ccbc and now are both up at twin peaks   i'm proud of my team, nothing surprised me about the results of game 7   the celtics went down swinging and that's all i wanted "
"what a strange week it's been   went down memory <propfirst> to ccbc last weekend and saw that the more things change, the more they stay the same   heck, even after a year and a half of being away i swung by the kitchen and decided to meet the new dwc and work with them for a meal-- all while hiding out from a certain chef   good times   big shout out to <propfemale> for making the weekend happen and being a invaluable friend "
this photo has like a day left in it before i switch back to something less evil   a 100 showers have not been enough to wash away the stench of it all 
"the long awaited interview with csm la finally went down today   total time: 80 minutes   gotta say i'm feeling good about the chances of being there when the fall rolls around   in any case, they know my time table and we'll be in touch over the next two weeks when everything should be official one way or the other   this is ridiculously huge for me "
"here's  <propfemale> from boston, in <propmale> simmon's mailbag summoning up how most of the world now feels about lebron james:  when lebron arrives in miami, will it be <propmale> <propfirst>'s responsibility to \put him down\"" since he murdered all of <propmale>?"""
"it was a sweet day running around the redlands with most of the crew up here at twin peaks   picked up some new music, hit up a chipotle, and watched the last episode of full metal alchemist brotherhood   took longer than i thought, but now we are fully rolling this summer "
"still awaiting my fate with csm la, until than it's limbo about the future   learned alot this summer    and i don't ever want to go through it again for better or worse "
extremely encouraging day talking with <propfemale> and <propmale>-- really helped to lift this cloud of funk i've been in   always comes back to prayer and caring for each other   god is so good to send help when we need it!
"going to csm la on august 1&2 for a trial run as a city host!  we're that much closer to having this gig become a reality and rocking skid row   big thanks for all the prayer from the crew, but especially my boss x who covets this greatly for me   please keep that up as i'll need it to be of any use to anyone out there-- got to have that heart of love "
"next sunday can't come quick enough   even if it doesn't work out in la, i'm content with having pushed everything this far   this gig for all intensive purposes would be a dream come true "
"won an epic game of chess against my roommate <propmale>, dude is good   and for those who are interested, it's la on saturday, as me and my boss x will be kicking it there a day in advance of the scheduled meeting with csm   i have so much love for that man!"
"tommorow should be the day i find out about csm la   god, what a draining summer   i'll try to throw up a note about it sometime in the next few days if possible "
"forgot to post this, but csm la is a no go   another avenue to serve the homeless, and actually help get that going is opening up out here in california, to which i need to pray about (and get an answer quick) in regards to helping with that or going back to <propmale> this week   ahh the cross roads, such has been my life these past 20 months "
first facebook update via phone  still working on my ''decision'' note 
"the \decision\"" note is now up to be read   more than anything i want everyone to know in both places that i love them """
"got to admit to being a little sad about not being at hbu on the first day of class   of course i still believe in the path i'm going, but i will be bummed at times for not being at school with the guys   planning on a new place for the new year if the finances work out-- stay tuned "
finished up another wood run   we're almost ready for winter  remind me to do this in another country 
car rescue number 3 for <propfemale>   
"the college search is in full swing--god willing my butt will be in a university for next semester   must also admit though i've been to a few places, this is the first real time i've actually sifted through all the options out there   i like this process "
sweet dreams of an old friend = day off to a fantastic start 
"despite the good start, things got pretty funky yesterday and carried into today   it's ended well though, and i think i have a better feel for my main co-worker   the future may be brigthening there "
"gotta switch the profile picture up   big changes are coming up here on the mountain, so why not start by bringing back <propfirst>?  also, i learned a lot today and am in a peaceful place on some big issues   geezzz that only took a couple of years "
well football season is off to a good start  go patriots (and good job texans)!
"all week i've been running into people back from the ccbc days, and if there was ever a week i needed that   "
there are few things more exciting than training a ten year old how to use a chainsaw   too bad no one else agreed 
"two firsts today: 1  picked up a hitch hiker, and 2  got stopped by the cops   going a little too fast for their liking, but got off with a warning   it was an ok day "
"so much love for the family right now   pops came through with a move that will allow me to move on with my present future   it's without a doubt the coolest thing that's happened all summer   much respect to him for that   oh, and ran into yet another person from back in the dwc days--it's almost been creepy how much that has happened lately "
"yet another massive issue that has been lingering all summer got taken care of yesterday, with a favorable outcome   and had waaayyyyy to much fun hanging out with <propfemale> running around murrieta as well   there is like a 0% <propmale> i would have remained sane (am i ?) all these years without her   i'll even forgive that loss in air-hockey while we're at it "
"finally got to hook up with operation provider   rad time mostly behind the scenes helping pull weeds, <propfemale> groceries, and learn what they are about as an organization   i'm going to very much enjoy the time with them each week   very cool group providing help to those struggling up her on the mountain "
"texans atop the division?  good job guys!  side note, thanks for tacking on another loss to the raiders who give their #1 to the pats   also got the first college application in today   it shouldn't take too long to get more done now that i have my information together   it'll be fun to see how this stuff shakes out "
rediscovered my love for 12 stones   things also continue to be cool with operation provider: day 2 featured running down the hill to pick up a car load of groceries and having a key to the office   helping out there has fast become a highlite of the week 
nother day at o p   today was mainly doing some yard work to make the outsider look a little cleaner   can't sleep on the small stuff   there may also be some potential for the conference center up here in twin peaks to get a little involved   it would be awesome to see some connections happen!
"incredible message tonight at the packinghouse!  wanted to listen it again on the drive up the mountain   nothing beats just teaching through the word even if it's <propfirst> 11    it's in there for a reason!  this also makes me miss my friend who is out of state right now, she would have done backflips for joy at this teaching "
"it's been pretty exciting getting reacquainted with some old friends from yes college prep   those days, beginning a decade (!) ago, were pivotal to me believing it was o k  to trust and open up as a person   like i had something to offer   yall did wonders, and those summers will always be special dreamy to me   hope life has been what you wanted these past 7 years   can't wait to hear more!  love you guys "
"after watching him kick last year for the texans, there was 0 doubt in my mind <propfirst> brown was going to miss that game tying field goal, against the patriots   thanks <propmale>, you're our secret wepon!"
"pumped that basketball is back   and my boys the celtics kicked it off with a great win last night over the overrated heat   oh and than my man rondo drops 17 assists, that's what i'm talking about!"
god i love rondo and the celtics!  24 assists!?!?!?
gruntapocalypse is ridiculously fun on halo reach   nothing like popping off a hundred or so while barely losing a life 
"missed out on watching mid-term elections   i'm a fan of all the drama though i don't trust either party   still, it's fun watching the elections unfold and news media freak out   hopefully today is the start of better times   good luck <propfemale> "
"going to vegas on sunday   first  time in three years, and this time it isn't going to be for a missions conference   take that for whatever it's worth "
thanks everyone for blowing up my facebook <propfemale> with birthday wishes!  love yall   and it has been a good day so far    but the real fun starts later 
"those wishes went coast to coast and even international (thanks <propfirst>)   this was a big joy of the day; seeing my phone say someone else hit me up of facebook   felt loved, thanks all "
"all and all this was pretty much the ideal day for up here--it had a little bit of everything good and nothing bad   oh, and the celtics whopped up on miami with my boy rondo continuing his out-of-his-mind play this season   added bonus was seeing the lakers get their first l in <propmale>, a city i am very fond of "
pats beating the steelers always makes for good fun--and is usually the case when they play 
nearly ran over pastor <propfirst> with a golf cart today--might have been worth it 
black friday!
i think yesterday i hit my last unfortunate event up here on the mountain   but a mere two hours after that i finally got word from the bible institute of la: i'm in as of january 26!  this is my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow    and it's been a long time coming   thank you god!
45-3 over the jets?  love to see my boys in action   <propmale> has to be the mvp of this season if they finish up the way they've been playing the last month 
red sox signing <propfirst> crawford to go with gonzalez?  and at their insane prices?  i think it's safe to assume the sox are gunning for a world series again   count me as excited and slightly horrified 
"very interesting day: officially got $4500 in transfer student money, a little more help with school, and finally had an overdue get together with someone i've been on the outs with   that went well and we'll see what will happen moving forward, but the time apart definitely helped "
"i've earned my phd in drama control these past 72 hours, even <propfirst> bauer would be proud   more on the slate for tomorrow, a funeral for tuesday, and san <propfemale> starting wednesday   secretly, i am enjoying helpig out with these on going situations and believe i have answers   or i could melt down soon, either way it'll be must watch t v "
"san <propfemale> tomorrow   going to love being up there, taking in the city   it'll also be nce to take a break from the mountain, even though i only have one more month anyways "
alcatraz was freaking awesome   it's definitely the place i would want to be locked up for a 20 year stretch 
"that's right pancakes, fear my butter!"
woke up this morning to find a huge chunk of the bathroom ceiling caved in from the rain  i think we can officially declare any drought over in california

"love to see the \we will out execute you\"" patriots are back with a vengence """
"so a letter from biola's financial <propfemale> office came in today   $14 4 k for tuition    14 6 k in <propfemale>!  big ups to god on that one   still need to handle room and board, but i can't believe i have a full ride somewhere    about passed out like in the profile pic "
"might need to end a friendship in the next few days   the person is unbelievable in so many ways, and apparently my help is going nowhere   can't stick around with that, especially considering the stakes   any advice my friends?"
been playing a hero father role the past week   got to say it's a role i'm well suited for and have been kicking butt at   one day   
"should be nominated for some nobel prize for the work i'm doing with a family   love em, but they sure know how to make things difficult "
"darn you rockets!!!!!!  \    and now to unwind with an episode of <propmale> "
"learning the value of time apart when it comes to conflict, or even relationships   people need room to breath, they will react poorly when they get smothered, but especially in an unhealthy situation "
"one week till biola   the only goal till than is to really get my mind into school mode and mellow out, after spending an extremely stressful week with a particular family   the chaos there has been cut out, and now i can relax "
consider the nuclear button offically pushed 
"if i'm the stellers i throw here and try and win the game   worst outcome is an incomplete pass, but you end it here and now "
thank you   go packers 
"moving in  room is the coolest thing so far, but the place is a ghost town and 20 <propmale> or more from la "
"on the plus side, i finally go to a school that has coke in the cafeteria   and the diversity of food is outstanding   diversity of campus? not so much "
my little world is growing again   these will be an interesting four months   but than again they always are 
always a good day when the celtics beat the lakers   i'm sure my celtics gear is going to endear me to the students of biola   
"congrats to <propfirst> on the victory   can't hate, they just won that game "
watching a heavy amount of gundam wing has really mellowed me out   almost feel poetic on the inside 
magic of facebook strikes again!  great night caughting up with three friends from the past 
"alright packers: i don't care for you, but make me proud!"
"good to see the pack win (want a mulligan farve?), and as always i hate the steelers and their fans   so annoying during the game   also won the bet on the final score with the guys on the dorm floor, i went with 31-20   oh and big game by rondo "
"reconnecting with our old friends at csm   trying to be a city host for the bay area in the summer   definitely sending a prayer up to god on that one   oakland, frisco; we've got more work to do (here's hoping) "
"it will be fascinating to watch <propfirst> <propfirst> go for the 3pt record tonight   the current old champ <propmale> miller will be calling the game on tnt, and kobe could get immortalized as the guy in the photo who couldn't get to <propfirst> to stop that basket   oh, and it's a home game   he needs to get two, and boy will this be fun   i say he gets it, and before the fourth quater "
"well <propfirst>, looks like you'll have to do it without me after all   joined up with a campus group called: brown bag ministry, and will be out on the streets of long beach passing out bagged food   looking forward to this   and will still wear my rondo jersey unless told by a team leader to take it off "
"knew my boy <propfirst> would knock down those 3s quick, and found it hysterical kobe didn't even challenge that record shot, he knew and didn't want to be that guy in the photo   except he is   the loss means nothing "
"great (surprising) win by the celtics over the heat today   love that they came to compete despite all the injury problems, one game left till the asg  break   heal up guys!"

"why thank you uncle <propfirst>, my checking account is very happy to have heard from you!"

just heard <propmale> perkins got traded from the celtics to the thunder  it's depressing  don't like losing anyone from the team regardless if the players they are getting back are good  that 5 was a brotherhood  at least he's going to a great team  baron <propmale> on the other hand

"had absolutely no energy or heart today, but just got a massive boost reading a little comment   the lesson as always: don't shy away from giving compliments, it may seem unnecessary to you, but be exactly what the other person needs to hear "
got a deep glimpse at what will most likely be included in the rest of my life  painful and ugly   but i'm glad i'm the one to handle this stuff   there may be some beauty left   
"went to long beach today hoping to run into <propmale> at the apartments   oh did it happen, and boy did he caught me napping when i said i liked <propmale> <propmale>   couldn't name a song besides \rolling stone\"" or \""all along the watchtower\"" when put to the test   i'll redeem myself next week when i read: chronicles i and list twenty songs   guy is always a bunch of fun """
