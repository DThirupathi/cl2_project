at the end of the day when all is said and done i know i can lay my head down and close my eyes and know i have not intentionly hurt noone  but if i do happen 2 hurt someone i will b a better person and stand up and let them know that i am sorry 4 any wrong doing  what more could anyone ask 4 out of a person?
"being a adult is knowing when u r wrong and owning up 2 it, trust only urself and realize when someone is play'n games  i am 2 old 2 play i gave up the playground a long time ago now i save it 4 my children  today i can say i am a adult ,not perfect, but i try 2 b there 4 all i make mistakes and i can say i will own up 2 mine will anyone else?"

i am not perfect but i always look at me cause if i watch what others r doing i will miss what is going on n my life and i can promise u this when i lose prospective of my own life it will spin out of control so i love all but i will not allow my life to tumble sorry if that sounds selfish 
"if someone makes derogatory statements toward u assuming u have done something wrong they should always confront that person because a assumption is just what it is, a assumption, that is the only way 2 find out the truth, sometimes this person may b surprised that they may have jumped the gun so always check urself b4 u assume "

"i am sick and tired of ppl being able to speak their mind but if i do then i am wrong , but the truth is noone wants to hear the truth "
i am 44 yrs old and my children were taught to respect their elders whether they were rite or wrong i earned the rite to speak my mind and i have also earned the rite to b respected i dont ask for respect i e playful ect respect and the world needs to go back to that kind of thinking and maybe we would not have to worry bout our children getting out here and doing so many bad things
i do not proclaim to have perfect children they make mistakes just like everyone else but they know their boundries with me and others  but i am gratful 1 is off to college this year and 1 is living her own life and paying her own way and that is how it works  all they ask me for is to be here if they need me and i am

"i know alot of ppl believe the healthcare reform is socializism and think it is wrong to be told u gotta have health insurance and that it is against constitutional rights, but isn't car insurance the same? just asking"
"also, think about it this way if everyone has to have health insurance would'nt it b nice to know that our tax dollars r not going to ppl who choose not to work and depend on us to <propfemale> the load for them? im not talk'n bout ppl who cannot work just the 1's who can and do not want to "
"and think bout the illegals who come here and work that do not take insurance on the job cause they can get medicaid, the reason insurance is so high  n the work force is because illegals have become the majority and they dont get insurance so that causes it to b higher for the 1's who do purchase it  i am not being critical just looking for answers "
"i realize that we all have our own outlook on things, but at the end of the day dont we all just want prospierty for all and to all have the <propmale> to go to college, have gd jobs and b able to live a long enjoyable life without so many obstacles in everyones way"
why is it hard for some to pray? but so easy to cuss? why is it so hard to repost a godly bulletin but easy to re-post the gossip? why can people worship a celebrity but not jesus christ? gonna ignore this? afraid to get laughed at? most of you wonâ€™t re-post this     the lord said if you deny me in front of your friends       i will deny you in front of my father!! i posted it     will you

noone seems to care but love to put their 2 cents worth n but never come around to help well to those type of families i say let me do what i do if u wanna help come on but if not keep ur 2 cents to urself  in the end u will b the 1 who has to look n the mirror not me!
