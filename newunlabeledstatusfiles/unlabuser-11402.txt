"-everybody stand up! today's the best day to get up  everyone is a victim of this attraction, yeah  come on! everybody hands up! it's the highly anticipated hero's comeback! hold up your fingers and count down   3  2  1  make some noise!"
"-you got to be careful with things nearest to you, you know the closer you get to something the tougher it is to see   and i'll never take it for granted, let go   "
"-heh it makes sense now why she doesn't like me, go figure"
"-no regrets, no distractions"
"-there's no need for sadness anymore, because there's always a sliver lining  joyful "
"-lost in a dark abyss looking for a way out, there must have been something i missed   "
-i wish i have nothing to do in the morning so i could just stargaze all night
-damn this human flaw of curiosity
"-just take a <propmale>, it makes life worth living and exciting"
"-a hero to some, an angel to a few, but a friend to all"
"-helpful words are like a train track switch, it's only an inch from a wreck or a smooth travel to prosperity"
-i'll be that hero you can turn to
"-i try to find the good in life, but good things are hard to come by"
-right here on my wing you can rest your head
-with theses eyes i can see the lies
"-i laugh at the idea i'm \most optimistic\"" because everywhere i turn i see and feel disappointment hmm  """
-are you ready? set  go!
"-dream, live, and make life an adventure"
-people are really interesting
"-ha! why let idiots ruin the night, glad i had a laugh with the other ones there"
yarinokoshitera koto yarinaoshite mitai <propfemale>
"-it's ok not to know where we'll be later on  hell, i'll tell you when i get there too "
"-life isn't complicated, it's really on how we view that complicates things"
"-i can bring a thought to your mind, a tear to your eye or a smile to your face, the catch is i can't be seen because i'm just a memory"
-i always think i'm insignificant but everyone see that i'll be the one to make a difference
"-everyday seems to be a lie, i don't know why  i just want to fly into that big blue sky"
"-battle every minute, fight every second"
is finally taking one day at a time
feels like falling
-looks like luck makes fools of us all
-things happen in a flash but feels like an eternity
is doing strength training for freerunning
"-in order to have a life of happiness, one must take in each day at a time and <propfemale> the moments; in order to have a life of purpose, one must focus on the future and plan for that destination; though i question myself each day 'why can't i have both?' "
-maybe that one mistake helped me understand that everything can't go according as planned and i have to look beyond myself to see the world around me 
-taking a <propmale> can make this life an adventure or nothing meaningful at all
-even though action speak louder than words they both have the same effect
-just got to make the best of the situation
finally finished a project that was suppose to be finished a month ago 
"-life and time go hand in hand, let's make the most of both of them"
-there's always that subtle message into each phase
"-e playful eriment with the possibilities, nothing bad will happen if you try"
-i think i'm ready for the chapter in life with the similar but new system 
-honesty can be shared without being hurtful or rude; how can we let others know who we are or who they are; unless the truth is spoken then no bad idea will be challenged or no good idea would be shared
"-giving words of wisdom isn't my thing, it's just stuff i tell myself to make me feel good"
-the breezy night calms the mind
-how insignificant we really are when we look up at the sky and just dream   knowing that the world just keeps on spinning
-constantly falling through air watching clouds and memories pass on by
-the storm in my minded hasn't passed  i'm just stuck in the eye of it
"-i can't believe what i'm thinking, but it feels like i'm giving up, giving up slowly, starting to blend in so you won't notice me "
-maybe there isn't a reason to stick around anymore 
"-doing things our own way may make us unique, but when doing it with a group in perfect <propfemale> is phenomenal"
"-run, fly, breathe, flow in this movement of life"
"-learning the <propmale> of movement comes with alot of pain, good thing i've survived with a sprained ankle and cuts on my arms "
-just another part of life that just needs to get done
-the movements are basic but once put together it becomes phenomenal to watch it flow
-i finally feel i got all the time in the world to do anything 
-stand up and get ready to flow in the <propmale> of movement and motion and see the world spin
feels good getting all homework and notes for the day  time to work out and eat
-it seems everywhere i look someone a special talent  for example there is a 5 year old tennis prodigy in florida  i'm puzzled on what mine is 
-who knew i would be taking a class where i just have to show up and run to get an a  another great way to get freerunning training in 
-interesting how our perception can either open new possibilities around us or simply blind us from the world
-flowing in the <propmale> of motion one leap at a time
-the haunting past can still bring a sliver lining to the future
"-it's amazing that 5 minutes of solitude and bring my blazing temper to a calm sea, and that a friendly face can bring back alot of memories  interesting day"
-looking back again makes me wonder what i actually did in the past to make me what i am today
- i'm not the answer for the questions that you still may have
-there's no reason to give up now and be another face in the crowd   
"-they say good things happen in the end, but if good things aren't happening at the moment then it's not the end"
-regardless the reason i'll still find the strength to go on
"-standing on the rooftop ready to fall, i'm on the edge i could be wrong"
-lets take this <propmale> and jump to the next trick
-i never would have thought i would run into someone that actually hated me  its somewhat funny
"-though i keep running, i need to slow down to plan my next trick"
-if the power of implanting false memories were true then i would constantly question reality to no end
-somethings from the past can brighten new ideas for the future
-life is making more sense everytime i get up in the morning
"-just figuring things as they go by, step by step"
"-i just woke up from an awesome 2 hour nap, but i realize my window was down and its raining! when did it just start!"
-damn why does house and heroes have to be on at the same time!
-yay for hulu having heroes streaming tomorrow and house next monday
-time to change the pace and kick it up one more notch
-i doubt i could be that answer for the questions you still have
-what a depressing day this has been  luckily in 30 minutes its a new day
-even with a certain amount of discilpine and <propfemale> i'm still making mistakes that are costing me more and more regret and anger
"-though past mistakes have made me regret and learn, it's what made me on who i am and how i see the world  constantly changing opinion, trying to do what we see is right from wrong, and ultimately looking for an answer to life and how to live without regrets  that is who i am   what about yourself"
-even with the smallest accomplishment we can feel invincible
-maybe that dream i had might actually come true
"-dreaming the reality, living in an illusion"
-our shoulders bear an awful weight but we still trudge on just the same because we have the strength to go on 
"-we'll <propfemale> on, we'll <propfemale> on   "
-overall the rise and fall i will <propfemale> on with this strength and move onward
-blending in the background so you won't notice me is just my escape but really at what cost
"-life; ever changing and adapting, but in order to change what we want, maybe we have to remember on who we were to figure out what we want to be"
"-life; what a gift it is, so precious and short lived, and yet we take it for granted each day we live in a routine of safety and untaken chances "
-reality; something that exists through our preception of all other things and how we view the world for what it may be and what it can contain 
"-purpose; the reason for which something exists or is done, maded, used, or intended  why exactly am i here? for what purpose do i really gain from this, and yet i look back on my life and see all the friends and lives i've shared some shard of knowledge to and wonder did i effect anyone at all"
-<propfemale>; something that is or has happened for a reason to a particular person  is it really set in stone or is it really effected by our chooses we make throughout our lives   
"perception; an act of understanding means of the senses or mind  i can finally understand why someone would think my way of solving problems can be flawed, but it flawed because it seems to me it's impossible to please everyone so at the cost of my happiness i choose to let others have theirs "
-<propfemale>; something that is or has happened for a reason to a particular person  at one point in our lives we believe we can cast our own stones and others we believe it is set in stone   
"-perception; an act of understanding means of the senses or mind  we look at people with some e playful ectations by the way they interact with one another, but unlike most i try not to see something for what it is but what it could be "
"-searching; examining carefully or thoroughly  as humans we search for purpose and meaning  sometimes we feel low about life and think its going wrong, as i see them and feel the same way and i have to put my own sadness behind for now to help those that are lower than me raise so they feel like they are on top of the world "
-illusion; something that deceives by producing a false or misleading impression of reality  it is an <propmale> by not how the caster does it but by the audience preceiving it
"-scenario; an outline of the plot of a dramatic work, giving particulars as to the scenes, characters, situations  though i have planned for different situations i realized that i can't be prepared for everything, so i realize now that in my mind things change good and bad i just need to learn to adapt instead "
-past; gone by or having existed before  at this point i feel i need to leave the past in the past and just live in the present and dream the future
-though things don't go as planned it will work out in the long run   luckily mispreception of cards is a great way to entertain 
"-mistake; an error in action, calculation, opinion, or judgment caused by poor reasoning, carelessness, insufficient knowledge  as humans we all make them  we freak out at the first sign of it, and yet we preach its alright and that we can learn from it "
damn why must i wait just a little bit longer for my classes be available to me   -_-
funny how i am told i got a choice but it is limited
"lies; an inaccurate or false statement  we all tell them, to either protect or avoid someone  sometimes when we make them, they turn into a plot that can be obviously known as false  if you didn't want to see me a simple no is alright"
"-knowing others is intelligence, knowing yourself is wisdom, mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power "
"-as i walk out and cast my own stones of fate and <propfemale> i look back at my \set in stone\"" prophecy for guidance and inspiration to make the right choices """
"-as i sat there i asked myslef \why am i here again with old friends\"" and i hoped things were different but a cruel realization came and said \""that was the past and some things are suppose to be let go   \"""""
"-as i think about my past and regret some of the things i've done, it made me realize that there were bright lights from there that has made me who i am today"
-sometimes its just nice to have a day to myself without any interuptions or distractions  maybe then i can figure things through
-shift reality and do something magical 
-at this point it feels like i just need to let go 
-even the simplest concept can bring an interesting effect 
-let's not always believe what we percieve  remember it can be a misdirection of the illusion 
"-when that diffcult task is presented to us, most panic under the condition and become stress  though when our attitude about the situation is at its best that is when we can the brightest outcome "
-interesting how thing won't go as planned and yet get the result we longed for in the end 
"-why fear the uncertain future? we also act as if it's written in stone, and yet we e playful ress that we have the choice in the matter  we vaguely plan out what will happen tomorrow, next week, next year  though we know it may and may not happen as we hope  let's not fear what we don't know "
-<propfemale> has a funny way of repaying me  for having a busy day at work and paying for my e playful enses  i can somewhat feel tomorrow will be easier than i ordinally planned
"-why try, so hard for all the things we do, sit back, relax and the thing will come naturally to you  though we are lost in this illusion  no worries in reality there's always a solution "
-one may have good eyes and yet see nothing at all  keep an open mind to the possibilities around us rather than stick firmly to what we believe 
-i never would have thought that i'd get to that point where i wish the people of my past would just go away 
-reimagine reality and bring the possibilites to new heights
"-interesting on how well i have been doing these past couple days  aced a speech and a test, but it feels like somethings got to go wrong cause i'm feeling too good "
"-life's simple, we make choices and don't look back  and yet we still do because of our damn fear and regret we suffer from "
-no reason to give up now  i guess i'm going down swinging
-wow i can't believe it but i'm actually bored out of my mind right now 
-sometimes we just have to take a <propmale> to find out what we really want in life  though we have to remember who we were in order to know what we want to be 
-the answer won't come to us until we actually seek it 
-bored once again and needing some new material for a card trick 
-interesting how i quickly i disappear from someone's mind and thinking to myself how insignificant my actions are 
-i can't believe what happened tonight  maybe things happen for a reason that needs to be seeked and where the answer lie in the unknown 
-looks like i'm heading home  hope you guys that see this have a happy thankgiving and that i am grateful to know friends like you 
"-everyone that has met me as some point in time really had an impact on who i am today, regardless if you believe your actions were insiginicant"
"-interesting way to spend thanksgiving   eating ice cream, watch house in my room til everyone gets back from their lunchs   halfway boring and lonely"
"-wow, that's one way to make me feel insigificant  maybe i should do a dissappearing act   "
"-no more regrets, no more worries  i'm going to take a chance   and alter perceptions "
-things are looking brighter with each passing day 
-i'm back at hills  weekend was better than i first thought it was going to be 
"-as the world spins on by, i know i got to try  though i wish i knew what to do, so i don't be that silent fool   "
"-inspiration is a funny thing  anything could set it off: new motivation, new ideas, and friends  i think i'm in the process of making a new trick"
-just performed 3 tricks for my roommate and had good (e playful ected) results  i'm glad this new one works
-nothing is coming to mind but i'll get the idea soon 
-interesting how poker players play the hand that they are dealt  the magician on the other hand is always in control 
-funny how no matter how hard i try i keep failing and making myself look like an idiot 
"-\in control\"" is one i've made and its ready to be performed """
"-this is interesting but that's life; live, learn, forget, and remember"
-i realized that our choices has a consequence  i also know that we fear the unknown and yet plan for whatever outcome with happen  at this point though i can fullly comprehend what i do and almost not fear what might happen  hm i guess that's what everyone calls taking a risk 
"-a little fear is good  it's what makes us feel human, vulnerable, but we have the strength to move past it "
-everything is everything  the more i talk about it the less i do control 
"-just got to take that <propmale>, perform the une playful ected "
"-i'm glad i know that some chances are worth taking, i'm just hoping what's on their mind is the same of what i think and feel "
"-i'm looking to the sky to save me, looking for a sign of life, looking for something to help me burn out bright"
-after studying this <propmale> change i realized how genious it really is! i can't wait to actually master it   
"-our dreams are worth fighting for  don't let fear or anyone get in the way of what we want  just believe, the possibilities are endless, and miracles can happen in a flash "
-today has been interesting  though i feel whatever may happen i got to keep my head up and keep moving 
-interesting how our perception of reality can change with the smallest amount of knowlegde   
"-a smile is the best way to get away with trouble and harm, even if it is a fake one   it's quite good fooling others  "
"-i feel the chaos around me, a thing i don't try to deny, i'd better learn to accept that, there are things in my life that i can't control"
-after a fast pace weekend i kinda wish for an easy week 
"-i wish i could make things right, and take control of my fate and help those that matter the most but it seems i'm still just a child living in an idle dream of heroics and chivalry "
"-i feel like i can disappear into this abyss, i've lost so much, i hope i am missed  i don't understand why i did the things i do, i wish i could make it up to you"
"-as i spread my wings i look up and try to fly to my dreams, who knew when i got there i'd be freefalling without a care, as the world spins on by i wish i would have tried, as i crash land here and close my eyes and say my last prayer "
-i told someone that they always had a choice in the ending they want  i see now that they aren't the only ones to have that choice as well  i guess this is what we call having hope 
"-the reason that we fall is to learn to pick ourself up again, with that in mind i can't give up now because once i do i'll just be another face in the crowd "
-the past is in the past  let's keep moving forward to the bright future  things seem to happen for one reason or another 
"-forever is a long long time, when you lost your way  but when you follow your ideals, is it such a waste?"
"-life; what a gift it is, so precious and short lived, and yet we take it for granted each day we live in a routine of safety and untaken chances  why not break that mold and take our risks and chances "
-i truly realize now that i should just disappear until the fact i can truly understand someone else's perspective  but right now i feel i shouldn't be here at all   
-my eyes are open but i'm blind to see the true pain i inflicted   
"-purpose; the reason for which something exists or is done, maded, used, or intended  why exactly am i here? for what purpose do i really gain from this, and yet i look back on my life and see all the friends and lives i've shared some shard of knowledge to and wonder did i help anyone at all or just made things worse in reality"
"-if something is truly important to you then keep fighting to achieve that dream, don't let anyone or anything stand in your way  because 'thinking' of doing the right thing is easy, but really 'doing' the right thing is the hard part "
"-listening to music, practicing some card tricks, and researching a new one that caught my eye  i'm feeling good about tonight and hope everyone else has a good night "
"-i truly realize now that i did my part in helping those that i care about and that they no longer need me hanging around  i can see their wings spread across the open sky as they follow their dreams  i guess this was my true sacrifice when it was time for me to let them go  live, learn, forget and remember "
"-one of the many paradoxes of human existence is that we feel invinicible and vulnerable at the same instant  sometimes, we seem to be capable of bearing almost anything but at the same time only a few harsh words can tear us apart  we then start to question if we're really as good or as strong as we think we are  i guess the basic kindness we can do is just protect the sense of value and strength in otheres "
"-i've played my part  it's almost sad that its over but hey that's life, things don't change, we do  as the days pass we live and learn knowing that each day changes us  good or bad, when it happens we shift our perspective on who we are "
"-a kind action is done with careful consideration and meant to bring happiness to the person, the best ones are done unseen, the downside is that no ones who who did it but the true reward is knowing you did the \right\"" thing"""
"-just one <propmale> is all i ever wanted, just one time i liked to win the game, from now on i'll take the <propmale> if i can have it  just give me one last wish, because there's a world out there as long as i keep moving on "
-i'm now inspired to study cardistry to make my routines more artsy
"-damn fortune dealt me a bad hand, luckily i know to swap the cards for a flush haha  today's still going to be a good day "
-i've never seen so many gifts that need wrapping   i don't want to see another present til christmas  time for a nap
-quick review for my test and the praticing some card flourishes
"-now i question about the world i know, and the difference between real and show  some where between fact and fiction, we'll master the mystery of illusion "
"-luck must be on my side once again, because i have a good feeling about today "
"-living in this blissful illusion, dreaming the dream, and smile at reality "
"-break from the mold, i got sureshot way to work this out, all this growing up has wore you down, i got a sureshot way to kill your doubts, find what your following and <propmale> it down "
"-trust your feelings, got to live and learn  i know with some luck that i'll make it through, time's on my side i know what to do "
"-in order to have a life of happiness, one must take in each day at a time and <propfemale> the moments; in order to have a life of purpose, one must focus on the future and plan for that destination; though i question myself each day 'why can't i have both?'"
"-out of sight, out of mind, i know time is on our side, taking these dreams and making them come alive "
"-turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into your strength, if your feeling down, look up and start dreaming "
"-as a fighting dreamer we aim high, we believe and just go our own way "
-the blissful silence of the cool winter night is peaceful with the stars and <propfemale> being so bright  i close my eyes with a smile knowing somewhere out there i have a purpose with a shining light 
"-i can bring a thought to your mind, a tear to your eye or a smile to your face, the catch is i can't be seen because i'm just a memory"
"-looking back on the pictures of my past, i wishing my friendships had last "
"-every choice has its reason behind it when picked and the outcome maybe known  regradless of the reason and outcome, we just have to take a <propmale> and see what happens in the meantime "
"-time is on our side with many things in our life, but our <propfemale> will be tested time and time again "
"-looking at these stars and dream, going through this stream of memories  knowing now where we stand, i have a feeling i'm going to be lost in this sand of time "
-good will and good cheer to the world out there
"-<propfemale> christmas to all, especially to my friends and the people i've met in my past that is a gift i will forever <propfemale> "
"-most people say time is like a river, that flows swift and sure in one direction  but i have seen the face of time, and i can tell you, they are wrong  time is an ocean in a storm  constantly changing like the tides"
"-plagued by <propfemale> where our fate lies unchangable, and yet with hope we take control and cast our own stones instead of it being written in it "
"-to have self-control and do what is necessary takes time, energy, and <propfemale> to do it right "
-as the year draws to a close i look back with a smile of my past mistakes and keep moving forward to the new year
just had the greatest epiphany at 1 surprise 1 am on 1 1 11  i can't wait to start filming this 
-life is what we make of it  it always has been and always will be 
"-there are many ways to define our existants, many ways to give it meaning but its our memories that give it purpose and context "
-i never really thought i had a <propmale> and i don't think ever i will but the fact that i keep trying is all i ever need
"-so unsure where my future lies, i'm starting to think my role is nothing more than to seek answer due to human nature and curiosity"
-my bad habit of planning ahead has put me in a bind now 
"-with each passing moment we learn wisdom and strength, but it comes to memories we left behind all the way back to the flow of time, we forgot how to leave it in the past "
"-in this dull boring world, charm it with an amazing show  live a dream one by one"
"-this one last bullet you mention, is my last shot of redemption "
"gotta get up, get up, we cant give up this fight now, gotta stand up, stand up, for what we believe in our hearts, gotta wake up wake up, from the illusion of our misery, gotta break out break out, from this reality and fly with me "
"-we got one shot, one <propmale>, to change the world with our hands  i got one thing to say, we live our lives like we live our days"
-this new outlook has been making things easier  i regret ever asking for a lighter burden instead of border shoulders 
-damn is it me or is this day draging on
"-today seems to be a good day for a tennis session, dinner, magic routine practice, then a movie "
"-in 12 days, i will have to wait to see my improvment from 2 months ago   "
"-11 days, though i feel like i'm back at square one, i am really where i need to be, re-learning, re-inventing, continuing towards perfection "
"-so far today has been good i got to <propfemale> out with my favorite people, even though it was few hours "
"-10 days, it seems each passing day has had its specific purpose that it wants me to see  today it kept reminding me that the possibilites are truly endless, regradless of the fact that i believe i'm in control"
"-8 days, embrace each day and begin it with a purpose in mind"
"-6 days, sometimes all you need is the right mind set to take on anything"
"-4 days, the complexity and possiblities that are in our lives has me in awe"
"-3 days, i never thought i'd be at this point in any stage of my life  surprises are around every corner and though we look up at the sky for answers when we finally look back down it seems the answer was in front of us the entire time   "
"-2 days, when will i ever learn that life isn't as predictable as i think and should just plan for the moment "
"-1 day, i never thought positive reinforcement could feel so good  thanks"
"-anything can happen, the closer you get to something the tougher it is to see it  i'll never take it for granted  let go   "
-it doesn't matter now what happens  i will never give up the fight  long as the voice inside drives me to run and fight  it doesn't matter who is wrong and who is right!
"-can you feel life going through your mind, what about time flowing through your spine, is your head tangled up inside   live and learn, forget and remember "
-i thought what i've learned was good enough but it turns out it was only the tip of an iceberg to a whole to place   a new world to e playful lore
-i'm having this uneasy feeling looming over my head   i'm wondering if its something that has happened or that will happen   
"-how do we justify our own purpose, is it the things we say  or do  what makes life truly significant"
-there's only life and pain that makes who we are  we are all afraid to understand the impossible  
"-i can understand why i'm filled with fear, it's cause i question myself what am i doing here   "
-make the impossible happen and think outside the ordinary  
-what can i close with leaving them in awe
"-there's always a choice, its just the results we have to live with"
-i guess my best isn't good enough because i couldn't achieve what i wanted
"-it's not what you do, it's how you do it"
"-once again i'm stop by this wall and i have two choices, one i turn around and find another way out of this maze or two i cut the corners and break down this wall "
"-my life has been nothing more than a freefall of memories and one of these days i'm going to wake up and realize something life changing, either bad or good "
"-we are the products of our e playful eriences, the choices we make reflect us on who we are and what we value "
"-this term has definitely opened my eyes but a cost: probably lost a friend because of my pride, lost some respect because i can't say no, and probably lost interest because i lost sight what i was doing it for  but regardless of the reasons life's full of mistakes to learn from"
"-something tells me that the answers are right in front of me, i'm a <propmale> blind to see it "
-we all have the abilitiy to do anything  the only thing holding us back is ourselves
-the people i choose to have around me ultimately reflects my character in the long run 
-though i'm falling down i know i can rise above this doubt
-looks like i got lost in the back of my mind  losing the concept of the sands of time  i know i'm not going alone but i'll never give up
"-keep going when your mind says quit, keep dreaming til you find you're living it  when you look around for a helping hand  i'll be there waving from the stands"
-believe what you will because that is your reality
"-keep your eyes on that mountain top, one step at a time and don't ever ever stop"
-a secret of life is having the pleasure of being terribly deceived  believing a lie to form reality but within that reality comes illusions
-i think i hit a wall where i don't see the point anymore  something's off but can't put my finger on it
"-things that were once unclear and now coming into focus, revealing a new possibility"
-with one goal done i still have many others to accomplish  no time worry because time seems to be on my side
-haha supposively my magic is the work of quantum mechanics  i don't think i know a mechanic   who names their kid quantum anyways
-damnit   i think my steam account just got hack   shit!
"-looking back on just what happened, i don't think i was mad but just shocked it happened  i'm actually questioning if i ever get mad or i just know it's worthless to complain about the past that can't be changed"
-it always seems that when i look for the solution to a problem it's right in front of me  so when i e playful ect it to be there it's not until i go searching for it 
-eh   school work or magic   i guess i'll do some math while listening to a magic lecture 
-a positive attitude may not always solve the problem but it will definitely keep things in perspective
-life is certainly contains une playful ected events   i guess just got to adapt and go with the flow
-we always have a choice  i just choose what will help in the long run 
-doing what's right and doing what we want can go together but there's always a time where in order the right thing we have to give up what we want the most
"-i've done what i thought was interesting, so for the time being its out of my hands to win  but i must say being a finalist is good but going for that gold will be better"
"-we constantly search for truth throughout our lives, but for most of the things that are important to us we simply need to believe "
"-feeling this good i know to trend softly now, because something is bound to happen"
"-though we may not be <propmale> or famous, hell we may not be important to others than our friends and family but that alone is enough  we all have a legacy to give "
-today has been a pretty good day  lets hope to end on a high note
"-so my performance didn't win  mad? hell no, a little disappointed but glad i was in the final 10, and the winner being someone that truly deserves it "
-so many things to focus on   maybe my subconscious will tell me with a good nights sleep
-looks like i got my answer   problem now is how to go about it 
"-\people don't see that their opinion of the world is a confession of their character \"""""
"-we've all been sorry, we've all been hurt   but how we survive  is what makes us who we are  "
"-now i've realized one of two things that has happened  one, through the positive views of the world there was a layer of sorrow to create the feeling of appriecation "
-two  i shouldn't complain for the life i have  it could have been worse if i have stopped hoping for a bright future 
"-interesting how origami can represent our lives  from a piece of paper having many folds, which is our past events and e playful eriences, to create a complex design, that reflects our character "
"-endless potential is within all of us  regardless of other's influences, it is all on us to bring it out and show it for what it is  believe in yourself and your abilities"
-though i am no where near this new goal  taking this journey towards it is going to be interesting to say the least 
"-i truly underestimated today  gave an okay speech  learned a little bit about some health stuff, and line dancing, interesting to say the least  performed about 20 minute routine leaving those 3 people speechless "
-changing illusion to reality with each performance  today is a damn good day 
"-even though i have my bad days, i can always look forward to start the next day with a brighter attitude "
"-84 made, 916 left, i think i will know once i'm done"
"-i'm just one person of many  though we define our individuality by our actions, emotions, and thoughts; we all go through the similar path to find what really makes us unique from others "
-the responsibility is on me  the outcome is one i can control  it always was but i never really understood it until now 
-i think i have an idea for my next speech but i'm not too sure  hopefully this will fall into place 
-as my shoulders <propfemale> this burden i have to keep moving forward  because if i'm not going to motivate myself then who 
-why see the difficulty in every opportunity? believe in yourself and your abilities to see the opportunity in every difficulty

after talking to a few friends i decided to give  up magic  and it looks like i'm moving to oklahoma  (the day keeps  getting better    annoyed )
"today started out good and turn into shitty day  practially failing some class, so i need to buckle down and study, so no magic for a while  moving to oklahoma because parents career choice, don't know if i'll be going to hills next year(maybe)  and i can't find my ipod  might have left it at the tennis courts earlier  great(find it send me a text)  at least its spring break    annoyed "
"-don't look down, and don't look back, and don't turn around your on the right track  keep your eyes on that mountain top, one step at a time and don't ever ever stop"

"-out of sight, out of mind"
"-someday you'll figure it out, and once you do  you can't help but smile"
"-559 left to go, looking into an interesting speech topic, and finally try to solve this damn puzzle "
-in my defense he was shooting at me first! hahaha good times
"-all it took was one look, 3 key words, and your response  i knew exactly what was going on in your mind  i just don't know how to response back for the positive reinforcement you need"
-true discovery isn't in new landscapes or things but in a new outlook and an open mind
-act as if what you do makes a difference   it does 
-don't follow your dreams   chase them 
-things are set  only thing left is to wait just  a few more moments
-believing in something and having enthusiasm for if makes life worth living
"congratulations, you've successfully made me feel insignificant  i would insult you back for your inept intelligence but that would make me be in the same inferior level as you "
-another step closer but it feels like i haven't made any progress
"-at least i'm breathing, at least i'm alive, as long as i'm dreaming everythings going to be alright"
-i think i'm going to be winging tomorrow  knowing my luck these pass couple of days i'll be alright
-focus one thing at a time and i'll make it through the day 
"-believe you can make a difference, and you will"
-it's funny how i constantly doubt my ability but once i perform and hear the comments later makes me wonder why i doubt myself in the first place 
-better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness 
-what lies behind us and what lies before us are <propfemale> matters compared to what lies within us 
"-our greatest moments aren't the ones where we never fail, but the ones that we rise up everytime we fall"
-i can't believe on how many enemies i've made for just trying to do the right thing 
"-things will be alright no need to feel down, tomorrow's another day, new opportunities are waiting"
-in order for me to know where i'm going i need to find out where i've been  
-life will knock us down but we can choose to get back up and go on
-i honestly wish i handled that so much better but really enough was enough
"-we all have 86,400 seconds in a day to make something of ourselves or throw away the opportunity  each second does count"
"-life is either a daring adventure or nothing, so make it count"
-one choice changes everything  
-the things we do defines us 
"-we are our own worst judges, i guess that's why i can't see my own potential"
"-yesterday's history, tomorrow's mystery, today's a gift   that's why they call it the present "
"if you can imagine it you can achieve it  if you can dream it, you can become it "
-what i do today is important because i am exchanging a day of my life for it
"-it is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities"
"-these last couple days have been amazing  i'm so grateful for this hobby; meeting new people and making friends, creating opportunities that were once dreams now into reality, and seeing things in a whole new light  i'm very excited to be performing at the studio next week  wish me luck and thanks to those who enjoy watching my <propmale> of magic"
"-i am one individual among many, the only diffence from me to the others is what ever you perceive of me "
-who knew that 15 minutes of complete silence and drifting thoughts can be so relaxing
-greatness is in all of us  it's just the matter of knowing where to look
-we are all faced with a series of opportunities in our lives they are just cleverly disguised as impossible situations
"-dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one <propmale> to do all the things you want to do "
"-if you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable, you disconnect yourself from what you truly want, and all that is left is compromise"
"-to accomplish great things, we must dream as well as act  it does not lie in where we have lived or the people we know, but the actions we have done that should be of interest "
"-most \                          of the shadows of this life are caused by \standing \                          in our own sunshine  embrace the opportunity"
-life is a succession of moments; to live each one is a success  tonight was certainly one of those moments 
"-whatever my choice is now, it will be in the past "
"-some believe in <propmale>, others call it <propfemale>, i redefine it as the outcome of our choices"
-when one door closes another one is opening  so right here right now i'll take this opportunity as a new start 
"-life has no limitations, except the ones you make"
"-with these last moments i spend it like i do everyday  put on my headphones, get pumped and perform something unbelievible  i'll see most of my friends in the near future  have a good one guys!"
"-so everyone is gone and once again i stand alone  this isn't bad, it's just the tranquility i need to re-evaluate what has happened "
"-i can dream for miracles, but i will do what i need to do to make good things happen"
-today feels like a damn good day  too bad i slept most of the morning  oh well 12 hours to do something productive
"-i once told someone \the possibilites are endless\"" so they wouldn't stop believing in themselves  because the moment we stop doing so is the moment we lose ourselves  even though we give up from time to time; we all have greatness in us  the puzzle is where to look"""
-we create our fate everyday we live 
"-be renewed every morning, for each day is a new life, a fresh world, the beginning of your journey"
"-i look around at the people i've interacted with and i must say that we are all very similar  though we define ourselves as unique individuals, we mirror one another  i think there is more to coincidence, but really fate that we all meet, but it is choice that we become friends "
"-though i may have missed an opportunity, my will is strong enough to open the door to a hundred new ones  the only thing worse than \a quitter\"" is a person afraid to begin  make each moment what it's meant to be """
"-though i looks like a long journey in front of me, i cannot complain for each step i take gets me closer to my goal"
"-those written words are spinning around in my head and i can't stop smiling about it  today has been productive, easy-going, just overall great "
-nothing more to say but its a new day with new opportunities
"-to enter\every activity without giving mental recognition to the possibility of\defeat; concentrate on your strengths, instead of your weaknesses    on\your powers, instead of your problems, and then we can achieve what we dream into reality "
wow my focus is sucks right now and it feels like i'm not really doing anything productive   eh fail
"-let the rain keep fallin down, cuz with won't stop me from getting i'm bound, yea maybe i'm crazy, maybe it's too late, but i'm gonna make it, don't care what the skies say"
"great friends, funny videos, good times priceless"
"-even with these clipped wings, i'm sure i'll find a way to fly"
"-i honestly don't what to believe now, but i know that complaining will get me no where so i'll just let the pieces fall into place"
"\george is my cool asian friend\"" hahah i like it"""
-i see no use in fighting or complaining about it anymore 
"-so letting go isn't that easy, i'm hanging on but i'm growing cold while my mind is leaving"
"i'm not a man of too many faces \the mask i wear is one, those who speak know nothing \and find out to their cost, \like those who curse their luck in too many places, \and those who fear are lost"
-am i really that naive to believe that there is good in everyone even though some of their past actions accuse them of being a bad person?
-i may be soaked but that was probably the most peaceful moment i've had all day  standing in that rain just made most of those worries wash away
-drifting in the cooling breeze surrounded by tranquility  a calm before a storm
"-to use my downfalls, my mistakes, my flaws as my stepping stones will make me either bitter and cold or enlightened and hopeful"
-this is just another moment in that knot we all have in our thread of life  its been an interesting day 
"-there are some that live in a dream, others reside in reality  only few can turn one into the other   "
"-do not lose hold of your dreams or aspirations  for if you do, you may still exist but you have ceased to live "
-life will knock us down but we can choose to get back up
-being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect  it means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections 
"-good morning, good evening, i hope you like dreamin', you live to learn and you learn to live, it's positive and negative, i can't sleep but i dream big "
damn no magic for a while cause i cut my thumb   fail sad 
so i realized there are some people i may not like but that really doesn't mean i don't like them just means i have no reason to like them yet  i hope that clarified that situation
"nothing like pandora, youtube vids, and chocolate milk to end the day"
"-if i can be like that, well i would give anything, just to live one day"
-a lesson without pain is meaningless; for we can't gain something without sacrificing something else in return  
"-do not lose hold of your dreams or aspirations  for if you do, you may still exist but you have ceased to live "
"-hard to keep perspective when your eyes won't close, its hard to stand tall when your already on your toes  "
-i can't bring peace of mind to anyone unless i learn to have peace of mind myself 
-lost? keep looking til something looks familiar; doesn't work? start walking til something does 
"-constantly questioning who am i, wearing masks and telling lies, the world is spinning fast, any day could be my last "
"-no longer in isolation on these days, causes my own damnation if chooses to stay, each day is a new life for change to see, find that inner peace within me "
"-we all have the ability to change the course of the future, regardless how insignificant we believe we are "
"-we all dare to dream, but so many of us hestiate to make them reality  why let fear of failure hold us back?"
not to brag but getting a free meal when you perform 3 or 4 magic effects shows how good i am  helps when you got one of the coolest waitress serving you and brings her manager and co-workers to witness it too  i kinda feel sorry for my friends that had to pay for their meals 
"-in our lives we have many choices  but to choose well, you must know who you are and what you stand for, where you want to go and why you want to get there "
-it's always the littliest things that give the most potential
i dawned on me that i have a performance tomorrow   and no set routines decisions decisions  anyone know which effects to do?
"am i seriously sitting here watching \tom and jerry\""? shit you got to love the classic cartoony violence"""
"well i'm heading to work but i'll leave with a quote\-as we continue walk along this journey never forget the reason why took that first step or we might miss that sliver-lining in the sky "
"-another day of sunshine, awesome because i have like 3 events to attend today and performing for at least 2 of them"
ok one last party to get to hopefully this will end well  i'm feeling tired but have enough to perform well
so happy birthdays to <propfirst> <propfemale> and <propfemale> rusch(sasha <propmale>)  i had a fun time hangout with both and i'm glad i had a <propmale> to entertain this week for you guys 
"-i've realized i have no reason to be upset, sad or angry with friends like these  to the new friends i've met, and the old ones that remain  you are awesome "
miscommunication is funny  and very annoying hahah
"-though we will have our missed opportunities, they create new chances; for everything we lose, we gain something in return"
"i've been sitting around planning so i believe its time to set some of them in motion  if all goes well then the future looks pretty bright, if not then new opportunities will happen in its place "
"so far so good, had a day being stress-free and i'm ready to finish this week with a little magic "
"-got this feeling you can't fight, like the city is on fire tonight, this could reallly be a good life "
"-all worries drift away to the many seas, nothing more but the tranquility "
"-we are our own authors of our stories; we control certain fates and actions, and have the power to make the ending simple and elegant or something extraordinary  so tell me what's your story"
"so i have 16 hours to prepare some routines for a wedding dinner, and within those 16 hours i need to perfect a new effect that is still a little shaky   i'm thinking this will be an interesting time crunch"
damn i laugh and hate how i can give great advice to those that need it but when i'm in a pinch i'm just lost  looks like i need to start walking
well its now or never i would ask wish me luck but we all know i don't need it  wink 
though some of my performances are shaky; i'm doing excellent i guess i got to thank those that wished me luck  you guys are awesome friends!
"at the end of the day, i'm like everyone else  i look in the mirror and question what i see, what i could be, and where am i going"
"-with each day being a new day, we all have another <propmale> to change the world  for better or for worst, its our choice "
"-the harsh reality of the <propmale> of magic is this; after performing something magical, they'll beg and praise me for the secret, and as soon as i give it up    i'll be worth nothing to them  and even if keeping it from them i'll still be worth nothing to them "
if what i dreamt were to come true then i must say i'll be please to live that life and die that way 
"-one more opportunity to go for the gold  i will put everything into the persentation and performance  i may lose, i may win  i will never know if i don't try "
-this might be one of my trickiest situations  i'll pull it off so clean it will look crazy
-great opportunities disguised as impossible situations  fair enough i'll overcome the hurdle 
"who's dominating? i am, suck it bitches  nah i kid the ignorant people"
"-success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be "
hahah this turned into an interesting ordeal 
-with time comes e playful erience and practice  i wonder where i will stand within one year's time
another day where isolation takes over 
\the\,e8a6b41ac5f265893022d295dc95eb30,where are the good friends when you need them? hmm
"-the world knows the true and the secret behind it, but it wants to be fooled anyways  because if you can fool them then you make them wonder  and believe  and think that anything   is possible   "
-most of the time i just wonder how big of a difference i made  then i look back to all the people i've interacted with and see some were insignificant and other life changing 
-anything can be accomplished if we put our selfishness aside 
-my job is to create a moment of wonder  from there its up to you where we go
i got to say this presentation seems to be good but i'll never know until i perform  who wants to be the spectators haha
-what am i really doing this for  is it for myself or for others  or maybe theres a bigger meaning in this that i can't see yet
-maybe   just maybe there's hope for me yet
-i'm prepared to die but there is no reason for i am prepared to kill 
"-all i am is one of many, significant or meanless, its up to the person that looks in my direction "
"-sometimes it's choice, not <propmale>, that determines your <propfemale> "
"-one thought influences feeling, that feeling will influence an action, and that one action can very well change the world  all it took was one thought "
-eh i'm just another guy that has a pack of cards  all i do is cut fancy and shuffle flashy  no big =p
-no great thing is created suddenly  
-it's hard to say what legacy i will leave behind once i'm long gone 
"-sometimes a moment can change things  retaliation of an enemy, realization of the truth, or the betrayal of a life-long friend  it is always the smallest moments that change the future "
-my legacy i'll leave behind  easy it's  
"scoreboard!! score board!! blu team undefeated! aww was that your friend, i knew him, i killed him and he cried like a bitch!!"
"off to work, this day feels pretty good so peaceful and relaxing "
-i just don't what to do anymore  it's almost hopeless  almost
-i'd rather have a mind open to wonder than one closed by belief
"-\why were you nice to that guy?\"" \""because i can see he's miserable and i don't know him so i have no reason to add to his misery \"""""
-the past looks better than it was  it's only pleasant because it isn't here 
-i wish i can figure out why i'm so frusterated lately 
-i've never felt this hateful and regretful before  what am i doing 
-our perspective can enhance our e playful erience of the world   or distorts it  there's always a choice
"-7 years can change someone  the first two years makes someone feel worthless and very depressed, the next three are hard to accept and move on  these last two makes one feel how could i live like this without them  through the good and bad i will do my best and continue living "
-change your thoughts and you can change your world
-damnit i realize i haven't filmed any of my contest entry  anyone willing to help   you get to see a magic trick  joyful 
-a strong mind bares the harshest reality
-one may have good eyes but see nothing at all
"-i will love the light for it will lead me the way, yet i will endure the darkness for it will show me the stars"
so i'm on campus hanging out  going to try and film for my contest entry  this should be a good day
-it's really what a person thinks of themselves that determines their own fate 
believe all things are possible
-knowlegde and wisdom have no value unless you put them into practice
"-keep it secret, keep it safe  people will beg and praise you for the secret  and the moment you give it up you are nothing to them "
"-to the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world"
"-there\ is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no \happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself "
"-our lives improve only when we\ take chances and the first and most difficult risk we can take is to be\ honest with ourselves "
curious what i think about you? like this status and i'll tell you 
"-time flows through like a breeze, leaving behind an awe-inspiring moment in its wake "
god white collar and lie to me must be the most awesome series ever!
"-hope is precious; even with darkness surrounding, don't lose hope because at the end of it all you will see the light  and though i may not be your guide out i'll be there with an arm reaching out to help "
"-it takes one positive thought, when given a <propmale> to survive, to overpower an entire army of negatives "
uploading vlogs and napping thats my day so far
"-truly great friends are hard \to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget "
well today seems to be a boring day  the only interesting i've done was make a card mural on my wall   i'll have a picture of it once its done  smile 
god why does it feel like a disappearing act sounds so good right now    annoyed 
-opportunities are around us   where will you be when it strikes 
"-tragic\ as it is when you work hard, and do your good deeds and when you need \help and really need it   people just let you hang  i won't make that mistake and i apologize if i ever have"
so much planning   calculating   if i can foresee anything that would be these next few weeks will hold something    interesting  joyful 
-so the concept for tomorrow   things will fall in its place   man i'm so hyped for these next few weeks!
"-i am certain that whatever hardships and obstacles that loom over us, our will will endure and an awe-inspiring moment will triumph   "
-things can't be set in stone if you don't know where to cast the first one 
-the shadows of our lives are caused by standing in our own sunshine 
-interesting lesson i've learned is that no matter what happens or how bad something is today  i know life goes on and tomorrow will be better 
haha i'm failing <propfemale> big right now  and yes it is funny just because   don't judge 
-i'll rise above this doubt  a new revolution is about to start
-each day is a new <propmale> to do something   interesting  anything works  possibilities are endless 
-life is made up of the simplest of pleasures and happiness is made up of the tiniest of success  <propfemale> the little things in life 
"-we are free to choose what ever we wish, but we are not free from the consequences of those choices "
so i can't sleep again and instead of working on magic i'm doing more paper cranes   yea too much time on my hands for the moment
"-i hold 52 selections, each unique but i will perform a moment of wonder with your selection "
i'm not feeling like myself right now  
-there are no failures - just e playful eriences and your reactions to them 
-being defeated is often a temporary condition  giving up is what makes it permanent 
"-i should feel no regret because some things happen for a reason  the hard times that we \all endure ultimately builds our character to the world "
this may very well be my last performance  i don't know i'm just trying to figure stuff out  though it may be overwhelming now i'm sure i'll find my answers once this is all done 
-nothing is wasted and life is worth living   just look to the stars
-greatness is in all of us  our job is to know where to look  joyful 
-generosity isn't the amount that was given but the manner it was bestowed

-a dreamer can find their way by moonlight and is punished when they see <propfemale> before the rest of the world
"-people may forget what was said, people may forget what was done, but they will not forget what you made them feel"
"-one move, one moment, one thought, one action can truly change  everything"
-\the difference between an \,e8a6b41ac5f265893022d295dc95eb30,"-\to leave the world a better place  to know that one life breathed easier because you lived  \"" that's is the legacy i strive to achieve"""

-some pursue happiness  others create it   and few  give it
"-character is what you know you are, not what others think of you"
-we are destined for great things  the actions may be small but they will mean something to someone

"-doubt can destroy someone for the inside out  but with friends that have your back and believe in you, anything is possible  thanks guys"
-i close my eyes and what i see is 3 doors 
"-everyone has a light that shines bright like any <propfemale>, the only thing to do is give it a <propmale>"
-i just have this feeling that my actions hasn't made a difference yet 
-a kind act doesn't cost much but it accomplishes so much
"-who's to say what's impossible, i guess they forget that the world keeps spinning and starts each new day "
-i know for a fact i'm going to get knocked down but i believe i'll get back up with a smile every time 
-hope may vanish but cannot die  if i can inspire or lighten a burden for at least one person then i've done my job for the day
-let the fears and lies melt away
-my value is the one i give to others and creating something of purpose and meaning 
well i'm here at bestbuy performing some magic what else  good times good reactions  joyful 
"-as much as it would be nice to stay down i got to get back up and <propfemale> on  cause if i can't get myself back up, who will?"
-our greatest weakness lies in giving up   the most certain way to succeed is to always try just one more time  i guess there's always one more <propmale> even a slim one
-i'm sure my role is done  so why continue   unless there's a bigger picture for me 
"-in this world there is hate, anger, despair, and distrust that is true  but it is also true that we have a <propmale> to change it with hope, sympathy, ability to dream and believe "
sitting here at a magic meeting it is interesting  joyful 
back from des moines that was great meeting other magicians that work professionally   i'm still wondering if it is what i'm suppose to do  then again there's a bigger picture i got to look at 
"believe me, i'm not gone i'm somewhere in the background helping  like a \guardian angel\"" if you will  playful """
it feels great being back and performing again  i hope my friend is alright
-motivation beats mere talent  but when both used together correctly they end up making a stunning achievement 
to all the people that i've performed for in the past and most likely in the future to  like this if you have a signed card from me from a magic trick and try and describe that trick i would like to know thanks  have a great year! see you around!!
-the difference between greatness and mediocity is often how one views their mistakes 
-reality is an illusion that can change within any moment  consider me a person that has an unique ability to alter your reality; making anything possible and creating a moment of wonder 
-i realize that waiting for certain opportunities is a waste of time  i will take any moment and make them great to the best of my ability  so why wait?
"-\what!\"" \""how did you just do that!\"" \""witch!\"" \""it's the medallion amulet\""   love those reactions  joyful """
-most of the things we receive is exchanged with that of what we sacrificed
