la la la la la    i'm not listening~!
i am genuinely starting to hate people
well the truck died on our way to school today so cesario and i took about a 25 minute walk to get there   needless to say he was exhausted by the time we got to the classroom   after getting some water he laid underneath the table while i turned in my work this week   i'm glad he was there since i would have hated doing that walk alone 
ugh   i just found my good head phones yesterday and today i lose them again 
i am so mad right now
december is coming quick and there are so many things to be excited about!
peppermint bark!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
today sucked 
as if my day couldn't get any worse the screen on my ipod touch is cracked   which means i have to go through a long process of backing it up and buying another one
"i don't know how often i repeat, \don't lock cesario in my room \""  seems like a waste of time to do so anyways   if anything just put the one that won't destroy things in my room """
"cleaned the house today   i understand the shock, but i am baffled as to why they are in a state of disbelief over my perilous feat "
got the blue <propfirst>  smile  i named her sawyer and <propfemale> loves her
a new video of sawyer will be up soon   she's much more lively today!  not really   she's pretty mellow 
i've decided to learn how to play an instrument 
why is it so bright outside???  guess i should take cesario and sawyer out to play abit   maybe walk over to meggy's house 
sawyer has chewed through both my game controller charge cables so i am pretty glad i bought a cheap back up gamestop controller when i first bought my system   still mad at sawyer though   won't be playing two controller games for awhile   what i don't understand is that there were other things to chew on in here    so at two different points in time why chew on those?  what was so compelling about them?
is at toys r us  smile 
so i am too excited for march to stay in february   just got to deal and try and live in these moments and focus on getting cesario and sawyer ready   anticipation is keeping me off my game   sad 
"whenever i download something successfully,i feel like i've caught a new pokemon ;p"
now that the weekend has passed i just have to survive until march 6th   this is going to be really hard!
my ocarina has arrived!
