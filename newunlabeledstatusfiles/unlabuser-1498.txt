"it was the wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in, shattered windows and the sound of drums, people couldn't believe what i'd become "
"if i could do it all again i'd go back and change everything, but time won't let me go "
i'm imbarking on the path of regret   i've traveled this path so many times before that i know everything on it and even though i know the end result that doesn't change the fact that i must do this 
i swear it's killing me all our shattered hopes and our long dead dreams  the wreckage that we all try to keep from coming to life and tearing us apart at the seams

"we were the kings and queens of promise; we were just phantoms of ourselves  maybe the children of a lesser god, between heaven and hell  into your eyes; hopeless and taken  we stole our new lives through blood and in defense of our dreams "
"the truth that many people never understand, until it is too late, is that the more you try to avoid suffering the more you suffer because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you in proportion to your fear of being hurt "
"it is impossible to fall out of love  love is such a powerful emotion, that once it envelops you it does not depart  true love is eternal  if you think that you were once in love, but fell out of it, then it wasn't love you were in  there are no 'exit' signs in love, there is only an 'on' ramp "

"we already know how it ends tonight, you run in the dark through a firefight, and i would e playful lode just to save your life "
"softly we tremble tonight, picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight  i said i'd never leave; you'll never change and i'm not satisfied with where i'm at in life   you said that you would die for me but i want you to live for me "
do you know what it's like when you're scared to see yourself?  do you know what it's like when you wish you were someone else?  do you know what it's like to wanna surrender?
"it's out of my hands but stuck in my mind in time i find my spine is crooked in design; i want to be so much   take this hand, and together we can make a better world; one where people don't have to be afraid and alone anymore "

"let it all burn! i will burn first; god i've tried, am i lost in your eyes? just let me burn, it's what i deserve  god i've lied, am i lost in your eyes?"
"in the brightest hour of my darkest day, i realized what is wrong with me; i can't get over you and i can't get through to you  one last kiss, before i go  dry your tears, it is time to let you go  because days come and go but my feelings for you are forever "
when i start the zombie apocalypse who should i save?
"could it be that the angel of death has come for me? i can't believe that my time has come; i don't feel ready, there's so much left undone, and it's my soul and i'm not gonna let it slip away   heaven can wait!"
"you put my picture in a box; it was the one inside your locket  your fingers say to come, but your eyes say i should stop it  if i regret all i've done, i would be trapped inside that locket "
"lika a gift from the heavens; it was easy to tell, it was love from above that could save me from hell   she had fire in her soul; it was easy to see how the devil himself could be pulled out of me "
"tonight i'm so alone, this sorrow takes ahold  your touch used to be so kind; your touch used to give me life  you were my source of strength; i've traded everything that i love for this one thing "
"i'm down and i get deeper with every breath i'm over the edge farther with every step and i'm taking my last breath i can transcend you and mentally bend you, but i can't handle the shit that i'm into i have been blinded and always reminded of the things i've wanted but i never could find i am a part of a world that i hate i wish the end would come faster; my world's a disaster "
what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you? and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up that you're ok? i'm falling to pieces 
"i need to move through this  the waiting just kills me and whatever you do is on you, i'm washed clean  don't be alarmed now  the story's ending  these aren't open arms, they're just waving you away "
"night falls and i'm running in circles, i'm being chased by my imagination  tell me i'm forgiven say you'll always be mine; say that everything is over, tell me i'm fine   no one deserves to live like this!"
"what hurts the most was being so close and having so much to say and watching you walk away  never knowing what could have been and not seeing that loving you is what i was trying to do  it's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere i go, but i'm doing it  living with this regret, but i know if i could do it all over again i would, give away all the words that i saved in my heart, that i left unspoken "
"and at the end of the day, not a fuck was given "
"i've never seen one like you  you're a knife, sharp and deadly, and it's me that you cut into, but i don't mind  she's playing with my heart, and she's playing with my mind "

"you can't control an independent heart; can't tear the one you love apart  forever conditioned to believe that we can't live  we can't live here and be happy with less; so many riches, so many souls "
"first time you feel it, it might make you sad  next time you feel it, it might make you mad, but you'll be glad baby when you've found; that's the power makes the world go round  it's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes,but it might just save your life   that's the power of love "
each night i put my head to my pillow & i try to tell myself i'm strong because i've gone one more day without you 
"you smile when you feel like crying, you act like you're okay, when you're falling apart inside and you let it go   you move on, because there's nothing else you can do   "
"even though my heart is tellin me to stay, beggin me to stay, my dignity is telling me i gotta walk away, so i'm gonna say what i gotta say  what's done you can't undo! i'm gonna break what i gotta break cause you were untrue "
"you know, the person that makes you the happiest will also most likely be the person who will make you cry the hardest   "
"itâ€™s always hardest when you doubt it  itâ€™s out of sight and hides from your voice, but you can never live without it; itâ€™s your birthright, this beautiful noise  are you burning the days just to get through the nights?"
"i can feel your heart in motion, deep down in your mind and passion  life goes on and on, we love each other in the sadness of time "
"how could you come with me when you knew all along that you had to go? how could you watch me sleep  so close to you, pretending not to know? how could you memorize my name and forget who i am? how could you think you're still the same believing i can?"
i could be a wolf in disguise  i could be an angel in your eyes  never judge a book by itâ€™s cover! i could be a crook or your lover  i could be the one or the other  if youâ€™d look beneath youâ€™d discover that you just donâ€™t know me!
"i was dying indside to hold you  i couldn't believe what i felt for you  dying inside, i was dying inside, but i couldn't bring myself to touch you "
"for now, i am here, but can one trust the future? no, not in a world that teaches us its ways with the morning <propfemale> "
"if you should kill someone's husband in battle, then his wife will despise you for that  and if you were to kill someone's son, then his mother will hate you for that as well    i know that because if someone were to take your life, i would hate them with all my heart "
"staring out at the rain with a heavy heart  it's the end of the world in my mind  then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call  i've been looking for the answer  somewhere, i couldn't see that it was right there, ut now i know what i didn't know; because you live and breathe  because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help  because you live, girl my world has twice as many stars in the sky "
if i'm sleeping then this is the best dream i've ever had   also i'd probably be in a coma and i'm very okay with that if i can keep having this dream 
if there are things in this world you want to protect   sometimes you gotta fight for them!
iâ€™m so addicted to all the things you do when youâ€™re going down on me in between the sheets; all the sounds you make with every breath you take itâ€™s not like anything when youâ€™re loving me!
"no regrets, not this time! i'm gonna let my heart defeat my mind and let your love make me whole   i think i'm finally feeling something 'cause just okay is not enough  help me fight through the nothingness of this life 'cause i don't wanna go through the motions i don't wanna go one more day without you in my arms   i don't wanna spend my whole life asking, \what if i had given everything?\"""""
"i'll love to try to set you free   i love you all over me, love to hear the sound you make the second you're done   s is for the simplety, e is for the ecstasy, x is just to <propfirst> the spot 'cause that's the one you really want "
"please don't worry 'bout me i'm fine   i'm only gonna play the fool one time, trust me when i say that i'll be okay   "
i guess i could just be overreacting   maybe a bit of sleep will make me be able to see things clearly   i just can't sleep knowing what i know   
"there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil and, i will tiptoe down that line, but i will feel unstable  my life is a circus and i am trippin down that tightrope well, there is nothing to save me now, so i will not look down   "

"all the right friends in all the right places  so yeah, we're going down  they've got all the right moves in all the right faces "
