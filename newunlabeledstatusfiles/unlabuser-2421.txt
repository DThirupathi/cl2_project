got pokemon black and white today! so happy!  laugh  didn't get any homework tonight either! today was a good day   smile 
screw you daylight savings time  i'm gonna be grumpy and tired tomorrow because of you    or i could always just say that i 'accidently' forgot to put my clocks forward and miss school  =p let's all move to arizona where they don't believe in changing time   smile 
"well, started reading my 150 <propfemale> book at around 11, with a few distractions of course, and was so into it, i finished it  looking up from it, i realize it's 2:15, and i'm only just slightly tired  if only all the books we read were even half as interesting as this book  school, i don't know if i'm ready for you or not "
"is soooo sleep deprived that everything is amazing, which means, i'm so slow and everything surprises me that it's not even funny   actually, it's hilarious!  laugh "
"i hate it when <propfirst> dapprich is right  >> i'm so tired i'm having moodswings, most of them hatred-wise  and i won't get much sleep tonight either  so, if i looked pissed tomorrow, don't piss me off more  i really don't wanna get in trouble for setting your tongue on fire or putting a needle into every one of your pores   but if i'm not super pissy, everything should be fine!  laugh "
"not going to school today  my sinuses are draining, or whatever, and i have a migraine, i feel really sick and like i'm gonna die  it's only a wednesday, so i hope i don't miss anything uber important  night everyone, hope you have an okay day "
"just woke up because of a text  of course it would be that the first day i stay home sick ever, <propfirst> krudwig shows up to school  >< that's called awful timing  hope you feel happy about that sinuses or whatever has me feeling like this  >> i'm doing a little better though, so by the time school starts tomorrow, i should be fine   laugh  i hope  "

"mom is watching jersey shore, and i can't focus on homework when i can see stupidity in action   laugh "
"got straight 1's at band festival, had a party on our bus ride back, and just had a good time  =p this weekend's going to be busy  (oh, also, apparently facebook changed stuff    again    just keep it the same please, or at least add a 'dislike' button first  >>)"
"long, tiring, busy weekend  had fun enough, but i need an actual break on weekends   laugh "
"tonight is sunday, so that means that tomorrow facebook will be aflame with all of the burning rants about how much people hate monday  many will be clever, most will be liked, but all of them will be completely justified "
"i don't want tomorrow to come, not because of school, but because i think the world needs to slow down  it's impossible to make the best of each day when so little time is given, and one cannot spend time doing what they love when it is sapped away by pointless, trivial things  but enough  i should have been in bed hours ago  good night all "
"well, this is going to be interesting  mom just found her tracfone after losing it awhile ago, and apparently there was a message and i have a dentist appointment tomorrow at three   if only the phone was found sooner, and we hadn't lost the card with the date of the appointment  looks like i'll be missing some of play practice   please don't kill me mr  <propfirst> dyer! d8"

"just got home, 2 and a half hours late  new york was definitely something, lots of things to do and see  but it's gonna be so nice to pass out in my bed  i wish mr  rudland would give us an excused absence tomorrow, or even permission to stay home  we're all exhausted and some of us (including me) or a little bit irritable since we haven't slept in a long time   laugh "
"has a decent amount of homework tonight, and i don't feel like doing any of it   laugh  spring break can't come soon enough  just two more days of school now   smile  will start playing bass clarinet in band again, i think, so that'll be an interesting change  will miss sitting by <propfemale>, and getting a good view of <propfirst> and his    <propfirst>-ness   laugh d"
"just realized that i haven't made a status update in a week  hmm   laugh  well spring break has been kinda tiring but fun as well  tomorrow will be the first day this break where nothing will be planned, and i'll be sleeping in my own bed and waking up with no one else in my house   laugh "
