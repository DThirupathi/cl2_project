we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers 
life is too short to be anything but happy

"if the bottom drops out from under our feet\i'll catch you, i'll catch you\when people say things that bring you to your knees,\i'll catch you\the time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry\   but i'll hold you through the night until you smile ?"
saying sorry doesnâ€™t mean there isnâ€™t guilt and forgiving doesnâ€™t mean the pain is gone
