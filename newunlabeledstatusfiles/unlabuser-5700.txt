communication is my favorite technology

"why do i read the news    it's like i forgot what it feels like to roll around in glass so i try again thinking it won't be painful    yep, still pointlessly painful  i'm sure mcmedia has more than money in mind    right? more than my eyes shifting over ad-space and clicking banners   ?"
nice day
"was having a romantic day at the park that got cut far too short by the rat race of work  time is the only distance i cannot overcome for you, my dear, but doubtless it will close in passing    so til then     wink "
"free will begets uncertainty, thus a playful life"

happy year of the rabbit
