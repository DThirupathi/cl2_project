"â€œhere's to the crazy ones  the misfits  the rebels  the troublemakers  the round heads in the square holes  the ones who see things differently  they're not fond of rules  you can quote them  disagree with them  glorify or vilify them  \\but the only thing you can't do is ignore them  because they change things  they push the human race forward  and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius  because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do \ --apple computer advertisement \",b156c530fc0c9de4eabe6e4bac3a9e91,"today marks 3 years of working here at acs  might not be much to some, and i'm still one of the newer people here    but when you're 25, 3 years is a good chunk of life "
