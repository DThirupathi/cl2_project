showdown in the saybrook library:  who will be the last man left studying?

"my fortune cookie from tonight's study break:  \don't panic \"""""
is back in siler city 
just called the neighbors to let them know they have some cows out 
i'll not listen to reason    reason always means what someone else has got to say 
"i got a care package from home, which raises the question: how many cookies can <propfirst> eat in one day? if you answered all of them, you're right!"
"'s mind is on a humid summer night, the racket of cicadas and bullfrogs, and an old creaking porch swing "
"my spanish isn't good enough to write an email to my spanish professor e playful laining that i'm dropping her class â€” oh, the irony "
"\me fail english?  that's unpossible \"""""
"i had a nightmare last night that i had been working on the wrong paper, and it was actually another that was due tomorrow  pretty sad right? whatever happened to nightmares about monsters or missing an easy pop-fly in the outfield or accidental public nudity?  *sigh* i guess times have changed "
"if i turn on all of the lights in my room it makes it seem like it's daytime and i don't feel so tired, perhaps "
"i'm loving this heat and humidity, it reminds me of home   in just one more week i'll be back in nc!"
ahh! this paper is moving at such a snail's pace  why is the last one of the year always the hardest? my focus has already gone on summer break 
can't sleep can't sleep can't sleep can't sleep
new cycling personal best today: a total of 4 bumble-bees flew into my face(one directly into my eye; i guess that's why you're supposed to wear sunglasses   )

last week of interning
everyone is out of the office today   i might have to take a 2 hour lunch break    at least 2 hours

"i'm glad this crazy week's over and it's finally friday   with all the rushing around i've felt like i was the rabbit in <propfemale> in wonderland, except i wasn't as nicely dressed "
"<propfirst> <propmale> and i, together all night long "
"and suppose that you lived  \in that <propmale> in <propfemale>  \where the average young person  \just hasn't a <propmale>  \to escape from the perilous  \pants eating plants!"
"\time happens to people \"" (?)"""
why is there no heat in saybrook?
my mom sending me sleepytime tea makes me very happy 
i just realized i don't have even one article of clothing with a yale logo on it for the game tomorrow   
back home in nc 
"i'm debating whether or not to go to class office hours  i estimate: 30% of having to wait in line for more than an hour, 50% <propmale> of the meeting being helpful, 100% <propmale> of receiving dissaproving oblique criticism of not working hard enough   "
"write, write, write   "
"i got a paper extension today and almost cried    well, not really  but it does make life a lot happier "
