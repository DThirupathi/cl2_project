a politician sees his family everyday; a deployed soldier once in 6 months if they're lucky  a politician flies 1st class; a soldier flies in a c130  a politician's pension is not reduced; a soldier's is clawed 65%  a politician enjoys an e playful ense account; a soldier must justify    extra rations  a politician vows to defend their country; a soldier actually keeps that promise  re-post if you appreciate our military
