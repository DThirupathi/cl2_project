"it appears that i will live  a shot has  already helped and other meds are on the way  being still really doesn't go well for me, but a nap sounds so good "
is on the way to texas for a few days 
realized that this trip to texas is the first real road trip since mom died  i miss her being on the other end of the phone armed with a map since i usually end up taking a least one detour  and i miss her talking to me because i travel during ridiculous hours and need help staying awake 
"umm, it is 81 degrees in texas as i head to <propfirst>'s retirement party "

is missing mom a lot these days  wondering how i'm going to make her advice last throughout my life and how i'm gonna figured what to do without having her to talk to about it all  thank god i never took her for granted in life and we squeezed all that we could out of each day 
"is thankful for prayer  we have an all-knowing god who ensures that all things happen for a reason and that good things come to those who work according to his purpose  and today i am patient enough not to rush his process for my life  well, almost anyway   i am really working on the <propfemale> part  smile  "
had a little epiphany today  help me out with thinking through it: what's the worst piece of well-meaning advice you have received?
"is back at my desk for practically the first time since 9:45 this morning   i think we have taken care of everything at this point, but now i have my day's worth of work to do   big thanks to all involved in making sure the multiple issues today were well-handled "

is multitasking on my last night in baltimore 
is heading back to oklahoma with a mind full of thoughts 
just found out that my flight has been cancelled      ugh 
"is now delayed in atlanta  when i get to my car, i'm going to delay myself from leaving just to be consistent with the rest of the day "
"seriously, is logic so elusive in this world that there are maybe five of us who get the concept?"
"just marked the first thing off my to do list for the day (yes, i had a list)   it was 4:51 p m "
is figuring out (again) that the most difficult things in life don't get any easier when you try to avoid them 
"is reflecting on living in a small, small town where events are still started with prayer, emcees read awkwardly from scripts, time slows down, and you are related to everyone "
service sunday today at 2 pm  we will be at sequoyah elementary school and will complete our project by 5 pm  please join us in giving back to our community
