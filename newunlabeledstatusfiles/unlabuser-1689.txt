"day 2 (15th): i woke up to see 2 feet of snow on my car  the roads had not been cleared  so i drove an average of 20mph and maxed out at 30mph  i only made it to the other side of boise - which i should have done by the 1st day  though i did stay in a pretty epic motel with picture of a woman above my bed that had no pants on and the sink, bath, and toilet were blue "
"day 3 (16th): once i got out of idaho the roads were nice and clear  i made up a lot of time and then just as it go dark i saw some kids pulled over holding a gas can so i stopped  i figured i had 3 dogs i was good  they were kids from bend, or  i got them gas and as they went to start their car it the battery was dead so i jumped their car as well  they were super nice and greatful  my day ended in wyoming "
"day 4 (17th): i arrived in <propmale>, co at lunch time  i stopped to see my cousin who i had not seen since '94  he invited me to eat at one of his restaurants that he owns  it was amazing!! i don't think i have ever had food that good before  and for @<propfirst> i will detail out what i had "
