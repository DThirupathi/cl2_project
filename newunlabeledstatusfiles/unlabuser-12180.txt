"this is a question to all girls: would you say whatever to a guy whose willing to listen to anything you say and he actually responds back  he listens to what you say and he even tells you how pretty or how sweet you are \would you ignore him or talk to him??"
now that was a crazy dream!!!!
i just saw eclipse again in imax!!!! now i'm in hogwarts!!
you know i work with kids and it's very common for them to blame someone for what they did  yet when you reach the legal adult age it's pathetic if you blame someone else for your issues  if you don't know by now no one influences you unless you allow them  my advice: get a life!!!! leave me alone  i want nothing to do with you!
can't believe tomorrow her best friend mikhail thompson will finally be 18!! good luck in competition today!!!! then soon after its <propmale> brown!!!!!

look i know it's so cliche but i don't care is it that hard to find one guy whose not they same?! i mean you think this guy maybe cool and then all the sudden he ignores you like you don't exist or he just acts like he's not into you  can guys just be real and if you like someone say it don't say you do and then don't act like it 
i can't choose my one crush! ahh! lol
