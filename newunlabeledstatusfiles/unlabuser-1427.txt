"why do we say time flies by? i think from now on i will say, \omg the time just drowned away today\"" unless it's a good thing as in getting out of class or work then i will say \""omg the time just floated by!\"" \",1d01feaa38e341f16ccd6c5f0586345d,i don't want to work tomorrow   have to study and study and study and    ugh!
going to work!
i just got hit on by a gay guy  compliment or not?
"home now! yay! tired, but awake which sucks! yay!"
head hurts  don't feel well  someone come over and give me a back rub and i'll pay in hugs and high fives  preferably female =-p
i don't normally keep updating like this but can't sleep =-(
i can't sleep  sad  and i have a final exam in less than six hours  sad 
"0 sleep = -3(5 concentration -9 exhausted)\-------------------------------------------------------------\                        100(-100 finals)"
"hey facebook! instead of trying to make things \cooler\"" how about you take care of the bugs first!"""
who wants to amuse me? i am getting ready to crash but text me something randomly random? or not    either way i'm bored and tired and want to get exams off my mind for now  yay? yes yay!
my eyes grow heavy and my hands don't want to finish typing yet i continue   either way it is night so i will say toodles for now and sleep well to all my friends family 
time to take my math & accounting finals  more nervously nervous than yesterday =-s
at chili's treating myself to a drink for finishing finals today!  wish i was with someone but at the same time i get to flirt with the waitress!
is it just me or are places not playing much or no christmas music? i think that's why it doesn't feel like the holidays  well that and the 80Â° +weather 
well my eyes are at this point too heavy so will say good night  smile 
so i ended up buying the new wow cataclysm e playful ansion collectors addition which was $80 00 but i got it for $40 00
heading to work for a less than two hour meeting  not my most exciting time 
"yay! \\passed all my classes with b's!\\could have been better, but i am happy about it!"
bored and sleepy   borleepy!
dumbest shift i can think of 8pm - 1am  they could have at least had me come in at 4pm 
yay it's going to cost me $25 or so for a cab ride home and i'll only probably most likely make $16 tonight 
i get to work to find my shift has been cut  yay?
"i hate when i see my friends family coworkers hurt, upset, scared, or even down and if i could i would find a way to make them happy "
i'm trying to sign up for spring classes at 2am and it's grrrring me up! classes i want are taken! oh and yes i just said grrrring me up
not looking forward to today     stupid apartments! fix that water main break!
"my head hurts, my legs are sore, and i'm tired  all i have to say is the water better be running otherwise apartment management will not have a pleasant morning   i will see to that "
wtf!!!!! here i am thinking it is almost 2am and it's only 11:47pm!!!! only 11:47!!! sh**!
going to go lay down now    yay for me!
i am at chili's listening to people scream and cheer at the chicago minnesota game  so so so so so bored!
oh no the dragon is on the loose again!  i must slay the bills and watch the dragon destroy those who piss me off  grrr face!
what else can go wrong?! power is out  may be several hours before they fix it  leak in ceiling 
"journal entry hour one: \\the power has been out for one hour now and i seem to be holding my sanity quite well unlike the others   the pink fluffy clan in the corner is already working against me so i need to act fast before it's too late  i have made a bow out of pizza bites but i ate them for the third time  i don't know how much longer i can hold out   \\end entry "
my mind wanders everywhere and i can never keep up with it  so much runs through my mind but i cannot write it down and no one to hear me no matter how much i try  all i want is to be heard and all i do is listen 
"sitting in the dark, watching a movie, eating some nice warm soup, drinking some rum & coke, and listening to the rain!  smile "
sleep is chumps!
so i can't sleep and obviously as usual i have to drug myself to knock me out   almost but not quite there 
i went out on an adventure to slay midgets   i couldn't find any; but no worries i'll keep my head high and keep searching!
apparently setting up alarm at 7 smile 0pm isn't the same as 7 smile 0am  who knew!
i don't e playful ect anyone to understand this but i'll say it anyway   there are times when i meet someone and talk and what not but while hanging out i get this weird vibe or feeling the person i am talking to does not belong as if they should not even exist 
oh 4am how you sneak up on me  there will be no way to get you back  even if i go to bed early you tend to sneak up 
"someone contacted me this morning i haven't talked to in awhile and it was good to hear from them even though it was an une playful ected conversation  playful  and it never fails when i think about them wondering how they are doing, they contact me within a day or two, every time "
well i start back to class tomorrow    not really looking forward to it but hey it's something to do right?
heading to class! oo
"i wonder how crap takes that  i mean just the fact everyone makes the comment \i look like crap\"" but no one ever stops to think about how does crap feels on that subject """
i can't stand the cold =-o
do not anger midgets as they will always be short with you 
yay heading up to the school!
