"to promise to keep a secret that eats you from the inside  stealing your sanity  a secret so vile and cruel that it makes you want to do stupid things  a secret  a fucking secret  what if this secret makes you lose faith in life? what do you do then? what if this secret is nothing but pain and suffering, hiding on the inside of you "
i have a secret like this  it feels like my body turning against itself  feels like death  i will one day track you down you asshole  i will destroy your life without ever laying a finger on you  i swear on my grave  you  will  pay 
"it feels like i am walking through the house which is my life, and closing all the doors and turning off all the unneeded lights  as i close the doors i see in the rooms briefly to things that are no more  i shut the door and i hear it lock  open doors leave a person vulnerable  so now   you know who you are   i close my door to you "

"fuck my life  the past knocks on your door and so you open it, and it tells you all of these things  it only asks you to build a time machine  so you build the time machine  then it beguiles you into using the time machine  turns out the past wasnt as great as either of you remembered it and so both of you feel like crap afterwards "
"so your life falls apart and leaves you standing on one leg, atop a high pillar that's about 6 inches in diameter  you figure it can't get any worse  then the wind blows "
realizing that there is no greater reason to life other than getting what you want 
why cant people ever just take a moment and look at the little things around them that make the world beautiful?
"there is a time to mourn and a time to cry  this is not that time  this is a time to stand up and face the world, to take all the shit that the world has thrown at you, and use it to fuel your drive  take the fight to the world and show that you deserve its respect! you can cry after you celebrate your newfound success "

"wake up after 12 hours of sleep and not be late for anything  get breakfast and find out that you still have some of your favorite cereal left  you find 20$ on the sidewalk outside your house and your favorite song comes on the radio  good day! then you hear \the war of spodification has begun!\""  day ruined """

"talking about what you could have done is pointless   and painful  talk about what you can do, and you will make progress, and maybe save someone's very soul "
