"is feeling a sense of distressing melancholy and combating with the feelings and emotions that canâ€™t be put away in box; one thing that d&d cant fix this time   \\\even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness"," and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness  it is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity \""\"e56ad0c1d593e95c64a30872f20001f2,"  i dont want to wake up tomorrow, i want to stay in these dreams a little longer "

"why am i burdened with the compassionate feelings i feel  falling in love with someone, yet allowing myself to fade into the background of their life, cheering them on when they find that one special person, that was supposed to be me  never allowing myself to be happy as well "

"has hit the boundary of love and devotion to the one that is so far, and the one that could be  distance can be covered if effort is made, but, at what price is the devastating outcome of waiting for that day, and the death that begins to rot inside the heart and kills the soul  is the price of happiness a dead heart, or a lost love?"
