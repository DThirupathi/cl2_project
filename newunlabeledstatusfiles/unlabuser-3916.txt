"this is the day, this is the day, that the lord has made, that the lord has made   i will rejoice, i will rejoice, and be glad in it, and be glad in it!"
"this, being one of the most wonderful days of my life, a new beginning, as if the first day all over again!  life is grand when you get a second <propmale>!"
"today is always a good day, and tomorrow will be better!"
"while you scream at your woman, theres a man \wishing he could talk softly into her ear \\while you humiliate, insult, and offend her, there is a man filrting with her reminding her how wonderful she is  \\while you hurt your women, there is a man wishing he \could love her  \\while you make your women cry, there is a man stealing smiles from her  \\post this on your wall if your against \domestic violence"
"never met so many touchy people in my life until i got out here on facebook!  and it weird though, how people can suffer so many things in life, the death of a loved one, loss of a home or job, divorce or bad health, but when it comes to the truth, people just can't seem to tolerate it, it's to much for them to bear!  well, when you start putting on the breastplate of righteous, you be able to withstand anything!"
stages of insanity: 1  talks to self 2  argues with self 3  loses argument with self 4  is no longer talking with self
today has been such a disapointment     
"happy belated thanksgiving everyone, it's been a great year!!!"
