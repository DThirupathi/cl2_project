1    2    3    4      freddys coming for you      
i am awesome!!! i went for a bike ride today and totally turfed it        scraped up all over and i sprained my wrist or something         yay me! hahaha
"is still hurting from my stupidity        but the scrapes are healing and i can move my wrist a little bit, i just can't pick anything up with that hand  that'll teach me to get outside and exercise!"
good day off 
just got back from a good bike ride  and i didn't crash this time! haha 
as soon as you're born you start dying        so you might as well have a good time 
internet is back
 smile 
isn't good enough 
today's been pretty decent so far  i was forced to watch <propmale> miserables for the first time       and it actually wasn't bad  too bad my day will go downhill here in an hour when i go to work until midnight     
grrrrrr         *wakes up* its 6 smile 0     i can go back to sleep for a little bit       *wakes up again* gahhhhh! its 8:50!      time to get ready for work
when you're a man with a plan     got a hammer in your hand there ain't nothin you can't do    
"went for a bike ride, my legs feel like wet noodles  lots of headwind, and its getting awful hot out  the bike ride was fun though "
got back from shooting my new gun a little bit ago  it shoots pretty well  i'm pretty happy with it 
"if you \like\"" this status", i'll post something i like about you on \0337b24c0a5cb9c1c9f09f7234e45728,work       blah 
tired      but tonight was good 
"tired     long day     went shooting, rode quads, got sunburned, ate nachos, saw toy story 3  time to pass out  zzzzzzzzzz   "
good 
"has had an excellent weekend  went and saw a baseball game last night(go toros!), went to church for the first time ever (kinda awkward and nervous to say the least ;^p) and then just relaxed  life is good "
i love my dodge      but sometimes i really wonder wtf the designers were thinking on certain things      like putting the oil filter in such a stupid spot! its hard enough to get in there but then once you're in there you have no choice but to let oil pour alllllll down your arm 
went and watched despicable me last night  it was pretty good  and after looking for over 2 months for a suitable new baseball hat    i found it! but      i was too much of a cheapskate to buy it hahaha 
bike ride!
"interesting night, got a parking ticket from the u of a because my big suv doesn't fit into prius sized parking spaces and i was over the line  ate at <propfirst> rockets which wasn't bad but it was e playful ensive for what it was  and then kinda wandered around for a while and ended up not doing anything interesting and coming home "
"has had a great day so far  went on another bike ride, watched a movie that made no sense, and <propmale> out  :^d work soon though, so that sucks  haha "
"had an awesome saturday morning! i went out 4 wheeling with <propfemale> and my parents  got to play around a little in the mud, my dad got stuck though  and it wasn't too hot out which was surprising  i uploaded the pictures from today to my 'durango' album f y i  :^d"
bike ride time! then depending on how today goes there may be some <propmale> taco and shopping for some new basketball shorts because *someone* stole my favorite pair    *cough* <propfemale> rozier *cough* :^p
"just felt like weighing himself after this morning's bike ride, and has now lost a total of 30 pounds in the last couple months! :^d"
time for work        boooooooooooooooooooo :^(

is trying to stay up late so tomorrow     errr tonights ride along doesn't seem so harsh at 4am     and it's failing    i'm tired haha zzzzzzzzzzz
"home from the ride along     it was actually pretty fun  i felt really awkward and out of place a few times but it was a good time  i'm really tired though, and if it weren't for my ipods spell check this probably wouldn't make much sense haha  zzzzzzzzz"

today should be good  smile 
the cardinals squeaked out with a win     wasn't pretty    but it was a w  really good weekend  smile 
wow       cardinals are looking terrible      of course it doesn't help when the referees eject players for putting their hand on the refs shoulder to ask a question    *sigh* there's always next week right?
together together together      together
"\everyday you can get better or be content on where you are at    i'll chose to get better today  be great today people! faith focus finish\"" <propfirst> fitzgerald"""

so i took that test for the sheriffs department 2 weeks ago  and there turned out to be 1400 people taking it      and only the top 250 got to move on to the physical test         guess who got a letter this afternoon saying they get to keep going? ;^d
"didn't pass the physical test for the sheriffs dept  didn't pass the sit-ups so they sent me home  wasn't told it was going to be timed either, i only had one minute to do 33 situps  there's always next time "
