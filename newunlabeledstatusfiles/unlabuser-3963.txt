southern comfort murdered me last night  never drinking it again 
come talk to me on stickam! stickam com gagethebum
damn straight: it's my birthday!
"it isn't me that changed, but your perception of me "
pissed the fuck off 
becoming disinterested  and i'm going to sleep 
"my assorted guardians have all complained at some time or another that i don't talk to them, or tell them what i'm thinking  well here's your answer: fucking listen to me when i do talk, and maybe i'll be inclined to talk more often  my grandmother likes to ask the same question, over and over again within the space of five minutes because apparently her brain shuts down everytime i answer "
"i'm oh so relaxed  the noise of california isn't so bothersome with headphones in, playing some nice acoustic music and looking out over my pool  i couldn't possibly be in a better mood, with the exception of my significant other <propfemale> being here love 3"
i'm bored as fuckkkkk!
i'm tired of    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
everyone loves being woken up at 4 'o clock in the morning 
"bored, but in a decent mood \wish i was going out to vegas this weekend  about to try and work some persuasive powers on my grandma to try and make it happen   "
"got a 0 in one ear, and a cigarette filter in the other until i get the other 0 stretcher \that's wassup"
"\i am sick and tired of war  it's <propfemale> is all moonshine  war is hell\"""""
new picture  get at it   laugh 
"you can't be angry with me for making my decisions, even if they don't coincide with the ones you think are best for me  i appreciate that you're looking out for me, but as you've pointed out: i am growing up, and i'm also at the age where i can make these kinds of decisions for myself  for better, or for worse it's my mistake to make"
have you ever been with a group of people and still felt alone?
"i guess i just lost the ability to care after saturday  i cut all the bullshit out, and i'm not trippin' how things go with my \friends\"" out here anymore  i've just stopped trying to make them happy and all that"," and i'll leave the maintaining of our \""friendship\"" up to them \"50d900f2e8253d30ac1acbce5493e6ba,"with the way things are going between her and i, this stay isn't too great \i find myself in a perpetual state of frustration, that seems to be growing \i came here e playful ecting to spend a lot of time with three people  so far, i've only really <propmale> out with <propfirst> "
"my fingers creep and crawl across the keyboard, to write about things that don't matter at all "
"i do believe the sun is close to coming up  i can't sleep, so maybe i'll watch it  it's been awhile since i have "
"in love, and loving it   laugh "
wassup las vegas?!
two days in a row now that i haven't really done shit 
i wonder at times what lays behind closed door in my mind  i know there's something there 
doors*
making my mom her birthday cake!
"my heads clear, but my stomach doesn't appreciate it "
"i rarely get shit on any networking site  i'm not cool enough for you kids to hit me up? hahah, fuck it  well, i'm in vegas for good if anyone was wondering  start school in a little over a week i think? not stoked i lost a month of summer, but definitely worth it  \oh, it'd be cool if someone hit me up  thanks, bye"
boredom  tonight should be fun though 
\this could be interesting    lets see how forthcoming all my wonderful \,50d900f2e8253d30ac1acbce5493e6ba,interesting  
"am i the one you see in your so-called nightmares? wake up and dance, dance to the beat of the drama"
curious curious curious
i'm kind of aggraveted
things change  some faster than others 
"i'm not sure what to say, but i feel like i need to say something  always with these ghost feelings "
had a pretty good day! considering going to church more frequently  i found the sermon today kind of depressing though 
"how interesting  0 o\on a side note, i'm in a pretty decent mood "
"family is over for my sisters birthday  i'm thinking today will be a good day, and hoping all the kids from sunrise have a good time at homecoming!"
"some people put their phone number on facebook  i think its funny because if you don't have their number already you'd probably be like, \wtf o o\"" if they text"""
"this kid makes me feel happy  not because he does anything for me, but because he cries about his life more than i do  mental note to stop complaining as much "
hmm  i'm curious  always so very curious 
i check my facebook so much more often on my phone now  funny stuff 
"\be the change you want to see\"""""
whennnnn the fuck are we going to <propfirst>'s everyone?!
sometimes i'm painfully aware of how ignorant i am and have been  it gives me something to laugh at if nothing else
"before i start college, i'd like to go to europe    i want to see england, <propfemale>, italy, greece, and germany"
"and i do believe its true, there are roads left in both of our shoes  if silence takes you then i hope it takes me too "
tell me why everytime i make popcorn it smells burnt  -_-
do you think that you're made of gold? invinsible?
i decided that i definitely want to get a motorcycle 
i have a headacheee! and i'm hungry as hell  all i've had to eat was doritos   surprise 
"every action has a point, five points make a fist  you close 'em, you swing 'em, it hurts when it hits  and the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits "
"i remember back in the day i would have conversations with people on myspace or facebook  more myspace than facebook though   anyway, i'm in the mood for a conversation  humor me?"
suddenly feeling nap mode  wondering if i should follow up on that feeling  it could mean a lot more sleep tonight 
i want to go do something   
 smile 
"going to a unlv game tonight with my step father  random, but pretty cool "
myspace hella changed  i'm definitely feeling facebook more these days 
it's easy to become callous 
idk right now  i'm frustrated and aggravated 
i wanna go home  i'm not feeling too well 
should've stayed home  my headache escalated 
i don't think it'll come as a surprise when i say i can be an idiot 
happy thanksgiving everyone!
"this school needs to get its shit together  they just called me up during my lunch, when they should've called me up this morning  now i don't get to eat "
apparently my chat isn't working     surprise 
readjusting to colder climates  it hardly bothers me now  i believe i was bothered in the first place because the transition was so quick  one day it's a hundred degrees and before you know it it's sixty  not cool
"okay everyone, it's monday the 6th  you can all change your pictures back  thank you, bye bye "
it's cool to have something to look forward too 
another dimension type shit today  definitely bonded with the homie <propfirst>  good day 
"anyone else think it's strange when someone adds you and then doesn't talk to you? i mean, what was the point?"
"<propmale>, first season almost over  i knew that prosthetic limb making dude was the fucking killer  i can see what all the hype is about, this show is legit "
"working out makes me feel better about everything  only when i work out alone though  funny, right?"
i look through things for little hints  things that might help me to understand 
i don't correct things while i'm texting anymore  not if you know what i meant to say 
"ahh, funny random things  going to have a cigarette  text me: (562) 292-1896"
i'm feeling tired  that's fantastic 
"things couldn't be better right now, all because the une playful ected person talking to me the last two day  i'm real glad it happened   laugh "
"utah, but i'm taller"
i swear i'm boring 
i think people like it when someone hides who they really are  all the mystery must be more attractive than being genuine could be 
"wowww, gotta revoke posting rights to that last post  little scam "
apparently my phone gets texts when it wants to 
i want this more than i've wanted anything for awhile 
i wonder   
i make faces at myself when i go to the bathroom drunk 
at the eye doctor  there's this old crotchety guy that's bugging  he's annoying the shit out of me 
i hope so  
my cat has his whole head in my shoe    this is slightly awkward 
if we weren't creatures of hope it wouldn't be so hard to give up  (this must have been said by someone before  i just thought it to myself now though )
"i love when i guess the next words to some song or movie  it makes me laugh, and smile "
i think you're something amazing  it's funny that most of the people that are think badly about themselves 
myspace sucksss now 
someone trying to chat? i'm boreedddd
if i get certified maybe i can get a lifeguard job at the excalibur? so sick 
"i just like to 'like' peoples posts on here  half the time i either don't know what to say, or i couldn't say it better myself "
you with the face!
"so now my phone turns itself off  fuck me, right?"
"not going to lie, i like being an aquarius far more than i did being a pisces "
"fuck \tgif\"" its all about fyiff"""
"i hate it when i have little chat things at the bottom of my screen when i sign on, and i click them but nothing is there "
and i'm off to find something mildly entertaining to make this sunday pass quickly 
"let's <propfemale> out, i'm bored!"
"\i can show you colors that never existed \"""""
"when i'm alone, or i don't care what i look like around certain friends i mess up my hair "
"i'm on stickam, while playing black ops  that about describes my level of boredness "
"\it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything \"""""
who stayed home today? i already know senior ditch day is about to be a fail 
walked with my mom and then jogged the last ten minutes  i need someone that's down to jog often  preferably in my community 
i cannot understand my personal finance teacher at all    but this class requires no brain so i'm not trippin'
"who enjoys writing poetry, and is down to write a freeverse poem using ten out of thirty words? pleaseeeee, someone be down "
i just went on a great jog through my neighborhood! i kept pushing myself to go longer and ended up passing my house a few times  everytime i ran by my breathing would get harder for a minute like my body was trying to convince me to stop  hahah!
that mental tug when you say goodbye to someone you'd like to keep talking to
third time's the charm 
a smart person sees a trap and backs out  that's all i did 
cool story bro 
definitely e playful ected that 
if i was born the day i should've been born (today) i'd actually have something to be happy about today 
"fuckkkkk off  hahah, redub valentines day \asshole day\"" because i'm nerd raging hard """
