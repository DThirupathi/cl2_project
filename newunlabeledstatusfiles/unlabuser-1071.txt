life doesnâ€™t always give us the joys we want  we donâ€™t always get our hopes and dreams and we donâ€™t always get our own way  but donâ€™t give up hope because you can make a difference one situation and one person at a time 
"keep believing that you have what it takes to make your dream into a reality  keep thinking positive thoughts, and know that you have the ability to do anything  find the encouragement inside yourself to know that you are worthwhile and that you are someone who deserves the very best there is   never accept anything less! - <propfemale> hill"
