"found the perfect dress for tonight  i am surprised at how excited i am for this party  head up, shoulders back  watch out!"
all i can tell you is that was the best party i have ever been to  but am too inebriated to even try and post the videos from tonight  i love you all goodnight 
"this weekend has left me exhausted, overwhelmed, in need of drastic measures, lost, reassured, loved, cherished, really shown who truely cares for me, found in ways i never thought possible  thank you for all who support in my decisions, appreciate me, and who i can truely call my friends and family  i love you all "
"this will be about steps, fast or slow, every one is important and needs to be thought out "
"today has already been beyond horrible  and it's only 9:55am, i need to escape  please "
"my heart beats quiet in a field of plumerias, healing quickly amongst positive energy, waiting to be cherished  it just takes time, and time is what i got "
i never have and never will understand mean spirited people  it should have been a red flag from day one  but you live and you learn right?
"just because it was my decision to quit waiting around, doesn't change the fact it hurts  thank you all for showing your true colors and mean spirits  trust "
"taking a step back, waiting patiently, and have \let it be\"" on repeat  but i broke down and bought a plumeria scented candle lol"""
if you all could please keep me in your prayers  the stress of everything is really getting to me and i feel like just crumbling beneath it all  plz pray 
"panic, restlessness, loss of appetite, extreme run around like a chicken with your head cut off type of stress,heart ache, anxiety, loss of trust & friendships, all in a week don't make for a good life right now  im blessed to have those in my life who are supportive and encouraging  your prayers for strength, <propfemale>, and for everything to work out smoothly,have been and will continue to be very much appreciated  love "
"today has nothing but intensity written all over it, but all i can do is bear the weight, keep my head up, and push through "
"there is a reason for everything and everyone in your life  and i love when people or situations arise out of no where that are a complete blessing, you may not think you are, but i know you are    i can do this, it will be difficult, but i can  here's to a weekend of rain, it is just the comfort i need, it makes me feel at home "
"yesterday i was overwhelmed with what i didn't have and was losing and running out of time  today, i am counting my blessings and looking forward, i can't let anything get in my way of being happy and working towards what i deserve in life "
