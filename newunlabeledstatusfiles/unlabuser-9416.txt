enjoying being married and being done with all the planning 
i have been having so much fun playing all these different farm games on here 
hey all i play county life and need more neighbors so that i can buy more land  i love this game come be my neighbor please 
why are some people so bold and back stabbing? things i will never understand  i suppose i am not suppose to  some people are just that way  i should accept that  thank god i steer clear 
why is it that quite often you can not log out of cafe world for a long time or you have to actually close your bowser and sign back in again  cant they just fix all these games so that they actually work right?
life is just what it is short  i hope to appreciate what i have and more so what i dont have  it seems that even when you know things are going to happen it just always seems like they are going to come later  well what do you do when later gets here? it will be here someday 
been studying up on industrialized food and its affects on the nations health and my families health  it is hard to read and learn that all these years trying to eat healthy and feed my children healthy i really did not know what i was eating and feeding my family  i now know that i've been slowly poisoning myself and my family  learn what you are eating 
support your local farmers and organic markets   make an investment in yourself and families health by learning what your are eating  where your food came from how it was grown and taken care of and what is in your food 
dont just go organic support your local farmers  it supports your community while improving you and your families health  think of whole organic food as an investment in you and your families health 
everyone is worried about global warming and want to fix it why dont we look at industrial farming of meat and produce and the enviromental dangers and damages it cause on a daily basis 
can someone remind me of what summer feels like again?
most people are affecte by disabilty in some way weather they have one have a child that has some or a family or freiend that has one  make your voice heard for you need or need for them speak to your law makers tell them what you need or they need the unspoken voice goes unheard  remeber you are your own and your childs best advocate
