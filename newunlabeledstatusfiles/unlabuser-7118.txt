"a <propfemale> is blooming somewhere, sweetening the air with its  perfume  there are children laughing through carefree  days, and leaving dandelions on the table for their mother   there are lovers holding each other and caressing their sorrows away  into tender smiles  but, today these things aren't near me   today i'm wondering where tomorrow will lead me and hoping that such  beauty awaits me on that shore of day "
i've decided that working on a ranch is just about the only job that i could handle staying at  there's really not anything about it that i would hate or even dislike that much compared to other jobs 
"well- i began reading moby <propmale>, and i already think it's an awesome book, so i keep reading long after my eyeballs have fatigued    i need more cigarettes    i ate too many chips    i'm drinking a soda, which is very cold because i left it in the freezer    and there's something in my slipper that i can't get out  the silver lining is that- i can roller blade in my own room to placate my sheer and utter boredom "
today is- hard    i can't quite e playful ress the depth of this day and all that it means  i just know that every time i get another year older- i feel a sense of the injustice of life- and death 
"roar! iz a puma- so  quick, so smooth  lol- don't ask  smile "

can't sleep right  can't think right  can't feel right  can't eat right  can't do anything right    wtf?
"why does every dream start with money; is it really such a great world? masters don't pop up 2 give free lessons, there's no excalibur 2 be pulled from any stone, even apprenticeships cost something  when the life you barely lived just keeps taking you into debt, then where do you go? there's like this scale and once you're on the downside- momentum takes over  it's an uphill battle- with a heavy burden "
"i feel like shit  tell me why i'm repeating this tonight; oh, yeah, because i love <propfemale> just that much- that's why  dammit, lol  sucks that she's leaving, but it's good for her "
"wow, i am partied out    two bar parties and a kids b-day    i'm good and whooped  also, my cat is attacking my shoe    on my foot "

"*she says forget what you have to do; pretend there's nothing outside this room  and, like an idea she came to me, but maybe too late-- or maybe too soon * yay! i got some ani cds!!!! that's the cover song to my love of ani's music, lol    cause i just really love it "
"well, 4:52 am    and i'm awake    i conked out too early last night "
"so    my mother deleted all of the music that i had on her laptop, and now my phone is unable to play said music via brokenness    so there went a whole hell of a lot of songs that i pulled out my memory like teeth out of live tiger's mouth! just thinking about redoing it all, it gives me an ill feeling, lol "
"awww, i smoooshed a spaghetti-o on my desk    really    really? lol"
"rue mcclanahan- better known as <propfemale> devereaux from <propfemale> girls has passed away    maybe it's totally dorky to watch that show at my age, but i do not give a damn- it was charming and i loved it and i am sad that she is gone  i hope that she is up there with <propfemale> and <propfemale> having some cheese-cake right now, lol    she'll be missed by a lot of people, though "
"if anyone is irked that i send so many causes invites, you can tell me you'd prefer i didn't- and i won't  not trying to annoy ya, i just want a lot of people to join causes  knowing and caring is the least that can be done for the world, i think  that way, when you're capable of doing something, it's on your mind- and each little deed that gets done by each person is enough to make a pretty damn big deed  thanks "
"my fortune cookie says: if you want the rainbow- you must put up with the rain    and, i say, \i'm well aware \""\",9122ff7d246936782bfc4646a028b355,"so- first off, f*ck bp! second, f*ck the bureaucracy keeping people from getting their jobs done helping wildlife  third, just f*cking fix it already! you don't stand around while someone is bleeding from the femoral artery arguing the laws, bylaws, and spending costs of operating: why would you stand around letting poison plume into the gulf and not put forth immediate and decisive action at any cost?"
"fortune cookie: there is no limit to love's forbearance, to its trust, its hope, its power to endure "
"i'm plastering on a smile and it's killing me a little bit inside, but that's the price of life  if you don't smile on then people drift away, and you're even more screwed than you were from thing that made you stop smiling  life, i've learned, requires a level of insanity- if you can't shut your eyes to the reality  you just have to bite the great big bullet that life is, and let it shred its way through you "
"i circumnavigated four blocks jogging this morning without stopping even once! i didn't even do the speed walk thing though it's very tempting to do    which is odd because it's kind of beside the point to cheat - when you're both benefactor and beneficiary  soon, i will be full on running again--- chyah dude!"
"how bout-- i quit smoking when you agree to plug the holes you put in the earth, reduce emissions to zero, and stop letting companies torture livestock  till then, i think you know where you can put your hypocrisy  right up your three-times-as-cancerous-as-tobacco-smoke tailpipe  it's only my body i'm hurting, and i don't blow it anyone else's face-- can you say the same?"
back from mo    
"you see me, you say, but you cannot see inside  for a moment you think something of me, but then you forget it and i become nothing \ i am no one again- each time i become no one to some one  i am some of everyone, therefore there's more to hate than to love in me for each  no matter the ways that i'm the same; i'm yet too different "
"as long as i surround myself with things- then there's always the hope that i will achieve the dreams which they represent, i say  they're yet reminders, also, of what i am not, never was, or no longer am  this place is like a box of stuff that i carried from parts of life that i've lived    now- it's all useless- but cherished- and their held memories cried over on still nights "
"sleep is an illusive little sucker idn'it    we're talking- stinging eyeballs, bloated gut, can't talk straight or walk forward, insomnia- here; this is getting out of hand  (do you have any idea how many typos i just had to correct?)"
"once again, i find the impersonal nature that \conversation\"" is taking on of late to be very perturbing  are we all robotic or just d o t  employees    let me know what's up  they're called human reactions    if you're afflicted then don't be upset when other people are also """
6 smile 5 am    i am awake    i just woke up; i am    awake during the day!!! boooyah!
"now, i am the one that has to live with things that were out of my hands  i just have to accept it and do the best i can  there is no choice but to keep moving; my born debts may never be payed, but time will not rest- so that i can catch up  i must accept and keep moving  the coldness stings, i feel it, yet there are no choices that shroud me with warmth "
"let's take a vote: who out there would buzz, to less than a centimeter, their (light-blond) son's hair -- without telling the mother    because that is exactly what <propmale>'s father just did  then, he flips out on my sister (franki, not <propmale>) when we're not all happy about it  how many people can honestly say that isn't wrong; tell me?"
"well, one of these days-- i suppose    "
"computers    are highly overrated  invented to make things easier, yet now that everything is required to be done on them    things are immensely harder when they are down or when you just don't have one   "

"okay, i'm running on the last whatever i have left   "
i feel like my heart has been dragged through a flour sifter  not sure how to put that back together 
"it's like, whenever i vest my heart in anyone or even any thing-- it's just like any other gambler who always bets wrong and always loses  i've got a debt of heart that can't be repaid  i feel--  about as bad as my body can handle "
"the babies have been whisked off to the professionals  i could have probably kept them and they would have been alright, but i do not have the resources or time to be both a raccoon mom and a <propfirst> mom, lol "
"well, now what? i still can't stop thinking about things--- i can't change those things, but they won't get out of my mind "
"every time i start to be the *me* that people like to be around, something happens that breaks my heart and i become this bitter person that doesn't smile for a long time "
i wake up and the memories are there; i lie down to sleep and they are there; i breathe and life seeps into old wounds and the new ones that shape them deeper  it's like there's nothing real about me; it's like there's nothing real at all    because reality is so far from anything that i want to see  i am so far from anything that i want to be

is     tired of people who think that i say depressing things just because i'm trying to be dramatic  come on  anyone could end up in my shoes; anyone could be as lost and unable to bring false peace to spoken words; anyone could land in the place where they have little left to be except sad  how would you want to be treated if you were without the necessary components to speak casually and live lightly?
