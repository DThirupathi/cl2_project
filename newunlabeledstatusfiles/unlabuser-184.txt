is not sure if i should just let go and feel satisfied or if i should try to keep myself disatisfied so i'm always striving for something   
knows why the kids won't nap today   because we get to go to a birthday party later where there will be other children and adults to see how terribly they react to no sleep mixed with cupcakes
