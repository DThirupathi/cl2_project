"don't you hate that feeling when you're not hungry enough to eat, but you can't stand the thought of not eating something anyway?  grr    digest faster!"
a particular maroon 5 song comes to mind and rather succinctly sums up my mental state at the moment 
"hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia - the fear of long\words"
yay! thunder and lightning!  i've missed you so much 
just went on a bike ride that was long enough that it felt weird to walk when i got off my bike   odd feeling 
less than 140 days to the release of book 13!  the towers of midnight is gonna be so awesome!
what does it say about me if i set up an elaborate system for counting certain words in the subtitles of movies and then try to keep a real-time breakdown of the prime factorization of the sum of the words counted?  those who don't know me well might think this is just some weird post    those who know me better know that i actually would do this 
spent 5 hours at the hospital    but my sister was there for a lot longer - but more members of my family are coming out of the hospital than went into it  laugh

enjoyed watching a humming bird get chased off by a <propfirst> this morning on <propfemale> square 
"the time on the clock is 8:58   the prime factorization of 858 is 2*3*11*13   that's the first two single digit prime <propfirst> and the first two double digit prime <propfirst>     why did i just figure all that out?  if you can give me an interesting and believable answer to that question, you earn a ph d  in psychology "
i finally cleaned my laptop screen   i can see again!  no more giant smudges obscuring my game 
"just got back from an awesome camping trip up in <propfirst>   the only problem was, my life revolves entirely too much around facebook, so spending 2 days away from here and i suddenly feel like i'm behind on what all my friends are up to   "
"rode approximately 40 <propmale> this morning   not nearly as good as my brothers can do, but still, i feel good for having done it "
"\and now we stand upon the precipice - we are come to it at last: the crossroads of our destiny \"" - anonymous"""
"i realize it's a holiday weekend, but is there seriously a call for that much traffic at 12 smile 0 in the morning?"
my afternoon nap turned into 12 hours of sleep 
is having one of those weeks where i have so many little things to do that i'm starting to get paranoid that i'll forget something 
some people plan their day around tv schedules   i plan my day around when the time on the clock is divisible by 9 
how nerdy do i have to be to have a dream about missing a lunar eclipse and considering it a nightmare?

"\i reject your reality and substitute my own!\"""""
"i know i'm a nerd, because when i saw that i had exactly 256 friends my first thought was \16^2!\""  and my next thought was \""i want to post that math fact on my facebook status!\""  (note: 256 also equals 2^8 or 2^(2^3)  )    laugh   laugh   laugh """
how nerdy is my family?  my dad and brother-in-law are currently discussing the pros and cons of different rocket configurations for the space program   and they're actually covering the engineering and logistical aspects of construction and implementation   i'm a little freaked out     but really impressed   smile

"well, i'm sick and throwing up, but at least i didn't get it until my vacation was over   and it gave me an excuse to come home from school early "
snow!!!!
"after driving around late at night i just want to say three things: 1  thank you to the guy at the gas station who bailed me out of a jam, which was due to the poor procedures of the stupid gas station, 2  i like snow, but driving in snow at night is rather annoying, and 3  the wasatch mountains cut an awesome profile at 1 am when it's overcast "
"w00t!  i got copy #926 of towers of midnight, the 13th installment of the wheel of time!  i got home at 4 am, but it was totally worth it "
