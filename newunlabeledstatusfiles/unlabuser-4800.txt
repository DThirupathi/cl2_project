"now officially done with 25% of classes  that sounds so much better than saying there are two years left   so yah, 1 4 of the way done! w00t!"
"dead video card = frustration of currently having a useless 42\ monitor + satisfaction of finally having a legitimate reason to upgrade system"""

"won $75 on 2 scratchers this morning, which paid for my green fee in the company golf tournament, our team came out 1 under par, and just had hawaiian food for dinner  great start to the weekend!"
"discovered that without my jacket, i lose my ability to hide in plain sight in the office  either that or murphy thought it'd be funny for me to bump into every manager in the hallway today while i'm wearing shorts and sandals    today was supposed to have been a vacation day!"
"just tried to take a study break by watching the news    bad idea, now my head hurts  back to meaningful study    it hurts less "
"heh i'm getting old   can't read 200 pages without feeling tired  or maybe it's just the bland subject matter? yeah, yeah i'll go with that  smile "
"ok, gonna throw out a question for anyone to answer: if you had a choice to live in either alabama, arizona, california, colorado, utah, or <propfemale>, which state would you choose and why (e g  -  cost of living, weather, culture, people, etc )? specifying an area of the state or even a city would be great!"

"got my trifecta! a+, network+, and security+ certs all in less than a month! booyah! long island in one hand, a tour book in the other, and my favorite <propmale> brubeck record playing in the background  wow, it feels great to finally relax!"
contemplating the paradox of introspection    only after looking at how far you've come do you only really begin to grasp how far you have left to go 
"going to the office on a saturday   what am i thinking?   oh yeah, \i miss my relaxing weekends \"""""

"spent all weekend cooking for a chili-cook-off this week  made 1) a spicy beef brisket pork sausage chili, 2) a <propfemale> lime chicken chili (tastes more like a spicy minestrone soup), and 3) my mango curry chicken chili  haven't really eaten any yet; just sample tastes  test meal with friends tonight! is it dinner yet???"
"ohhh yeah, had a throw-down challenge today at work for new chili! i'm making my newest concoction tonight: angry drunken sailor chili! grabbed the hottest peppers i could find at the grocery store (i'm not saying which)  i'll only admit to only one other ingredient: an entire bottle of 92 proof sailor <propfirst> spiced rum! mwahahaha!!!"
"no more chili; no more kitchen  seriously, after 5 days of cooking, i'm ordering out from now through the weekend! chinese sounds so good right now "

"i have discovered my public speaking kryptonite   a camera  apparently, this simple handheld device has the ability to push my brain into random word association mode \\me: \this procurement methodology carries great savings p   \""\",61406e7c03757830a5bb59e553c6aaf4,"new goal: after tomorrow's test, i'm going to pick up something new, like learn an instrument or read a new book  it'll be something totally unrelated to work, school, or tech skills  something related to that foreign concept i seem to have forgotten   what was it called again? oh yeah   'fun'"
"okay, any central coast drivers who happen to hover at 35 mph for 1 4 mile after entering the freeway: give up your driver's licenses and stay away from the wheel of any car! there's a nice line of people behind you who'd be happy to 'assist' you with this "
"days like today, i hate my phone  i get a very important voicemail, and it sounds like the person is talking through a wet sock  i miss all the critical details and now have to wait to somewhere between 1 a m  and 4 a m  to talk with someone overseas   droid, you're looking like a better choice each day "
a cross burning less than 4 <propmale> from my apartment   in arroyo grande? really?!? bigoted and xenophobic are definitely not adjectives that come to mind when i think of people on the central coast  what the hell is happening to my college home?   
"2) i had a lengthy conversation with the announcer for the hula group, an amicable older gentleman  this friendly, soft-spoken man happened to be a retired general dynamics electrical engineer  he's worked on nasa's mercury program for first-manned space flight (and met <propfirst> <propfirst>), designed systems for the air force's f-111, and helped develop the precursors to modern guidance and tracking systems for icbms!"
"1) a performing hula group was kind enough to invite me to sit at their table  <propfemale> and chardel - if you're reading this, their performance reminded me of what you both did for my high school graduation  to this day, i'm very thankful for the love and soul that you put into your dancing  i'll never forget your special gift! it was nostalgic, since this was the first actual hula i've seen in about 10 years "
"just got back from a dinner fund raiser event that a co-worker invited me too  i honestly wasn't e playful ecting much, but i was pleasantly surprised by two things:"
"in any business setting, if someone has a good idea, does it really matter who it came from? i don't care if it's the ceo or the part time janitor; a good idea is still a good idea  period "
