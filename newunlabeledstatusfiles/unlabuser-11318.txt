life blows but what do you do? you sit around doing nothing pondering on the fact that you cant do anything but feel self pity for yourself spending every waking day either doing nothing in your self pity or just simply getting fucked up to drown the sorrow of that self pity; bottling up your emotions hiding things from people getting intense suppression of mixed emotions
and feelings not telling anybody putting a fake smile on everyday just to hide the fact that your dying inside just from one thought; one thought turns to two then three then your whole mind is racing and you dont know what to do heart beating face flushed loneliness getting worse you start hearing things and seeing things having flashbacks and getting scared worried about your sanity
then all of a sudden you remember why your here your purpose for living your one       your daughter       your whole world and you live on
