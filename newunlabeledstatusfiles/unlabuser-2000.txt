you can tell a lot about someone's personality by observing the way they walk  i've noticed there's two basic types - the stompers and the gliders  stompers tend to be unaware of things and bash their way through life while gliders tend to be considerate and flow their way through life 
"remember that earth day was set up not just to be a single day but to raise awareness that we all need to take care of the planet every day  this is our home and we need to quit treating it like it doesn't matter if we litter, cut down too many trees, dump chemicals in the air and water, etc   just picking up the litter you see as you go about your daily life makes a massive difference "
it's another wyoming morning  tuesday it was 72 degrees and last night it snowed an inch and is still snowing this morning
