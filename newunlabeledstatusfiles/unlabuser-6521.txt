is now in a crappy mood and don't ask why 
"throw it away, forget yesterday, we'll make the great escape, we wont hear a word they say, they don't know us anyway, watch it burn, let it die, cause we are finally free tonight  tonight will change our lives,its so good to be by your side ,and well cry, but we wont give up the fight, we'll scream loud at the top of our lungs, they'll think its just cause were young, we'll feel so alive"
"love, loss, like a bullets path tear through the cavity of my chest  lights, out because the fuse has blown that's how we read, you like a polygraph  not, one single bone in your back own, up to how you let us down "
"a crack in the surface, a flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand), a cadence imperfect  like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against), a promise kept the dirt unswept, a poorly worn disguise; a child unloved that then grows up to love what we despise "
"so make one last call back home, cause tonight we go in alone, and i hope that you know i'm waiting, waiting summer, do you feel me? everybody's singing like they're crazy in love, we made a dizzy mess of everything and it was enough; so bring all the boys and all the girls together "

"imprisoned, inside this mind, hiding behind the empty smiles  so simple (the anguish), as it mocks me, crawling back into the dark  running, always running, into the distance  stop me before i bleed, again  the echoes of my voice  follow me down, the shadows i cast follow me down  deeper i'm falling, into the arms of sorrow  blindly descending, into the arms of sorrow"

and i know that it's so cliche to tell you that everyday i spend with you is the new best day of my life  everyone watching us just turns away with disgust and i'm racking my brain for a new improved way to let you know your more to me than what i know how to say  if anyone can make me a better person you could  all i gotta say is i must've done something good 'cause you came along one day and you rearranged my life 
i said i think that we can stay here cuz i feel our time has come and we can walk down to the ocean and sit with the rising sun baby you can lay me down i been running around with you its the afternoon and we got nothing left to do i said its hot outside let me go swimming in your eyes we been running for awhile why don't you lay down i'll make you smile i could never ask for nothing better than this
