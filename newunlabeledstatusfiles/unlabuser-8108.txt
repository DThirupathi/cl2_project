"we all tell ourselves lies; we all have buried truths   most of us fear revealing them even to ourselves   so we leave them buried and do whatever it takes to keep them there, sometimes forever   we forget the pain to power principle that coming to grips with the truth, rooted in the past, is our greatest source of power   turning pain into power means liberating ourselves from fiction and starting to live the truth "
<propfirst> frost put it this way: something we were withholding made us weakuntil we found it was ourselves
