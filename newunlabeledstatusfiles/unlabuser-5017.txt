"do you ever get tired of dealing with people who act like they are better than you, like they have something to prove?  be real or don't be - fake people get on my nerves, no one is better than anyone and as soon as some figure that out the world will be a better place   all actions cause a reaction and all i can say is be ready! you treat people the way you want to be treated!"
fake is fake and lies are lies and both will come and bite you in the butt sooner or later! you reep what you sew so good luck to those who lie when the truth is better! grow the hell up and be a big boy girl and deal with the life you have made for your self and leave everyone else alone! everyone would be better off without liars and fakes!
