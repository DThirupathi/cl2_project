i went and saw the bieber movie with <propfemale> theisen and <propfemale> and <propfemale>  i went in a skeptic and came out with bieber fever 
"you know, eventually gaga is going to have to show up at the grammys in a nice dress and ask that everyone call her <propfemale> because there will be no more shock value  i can't wait to hear what <propfemale> has to say about her this year "

the girl you just called fat? she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs  the boy you just called stupid? he has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night  the girl you just called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her  the boy you just tripped? he is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  put this as your status if you're against bullying 
i need a library card  or a bigger bookshelf with a disposable income for books  i think i'm gonna go with the library card
