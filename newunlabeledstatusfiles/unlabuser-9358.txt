"the more i think, the more i miss  id give my last breath for just one kiss   "
 playful

"oh, how i find every subtle thing screams your name  it reminds me of places of times we shared  couldn't live locked in these memories  now i'm chained to my thoughts again "
"oh, how i find every subtle thing screams your name  it reminds me of places of times we shared  couldn't live locked in these memories  now i'm chained to my thoughts again "
through the trees- low shoulder  heart-broken 
i wear this angels crown to cover up my devils frown 
"you always help me through the day, and it makes everything okay  love "

she was the sun shining upon the tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail  he was the <propfemale> painting you with it's glow so vulnerable and pale 
"\i promise to love you every moment of forever\"""""
"when the night falls in around me, i dont think ill make it through  ill use your light to guide the way, cause all i think about is you "
goin to my mommys! leavin round 11am  im happy love 
so many days i've been blind  i want to stop and rewind   love 
these endless thoughts drip from my soul  every single word secretly paints a fairytale of when we will melt into one  
absence makes the heart grow fonder 
"  now your voice is haunting me, just out of reach, it buries me   love "
i feel empty  youre pushing me away   heart-broken 
remember me 
beany loves mookie  love  pahahaha  laugh 
im busy mending broken pieces of the life i had before  
"love kills, romance is dead and i don't even trust myself  but i love you  and you can pull my wings apart and pin me down under glass until the end of days if it can help you \discover that we share the same pain   love "

"you can make your own decisions, you can make your own mistakes  ill live and let die all the promises you made  but if you lie another time, itll be a lie thats too late   heart-broken "
im trying to get to you  but time isnt on my side  if the truth is the worst i can do   then i guess that i have lied   heart-broken 
daggers speak louder than words heart-broken 
heres my heart  you can take it  just dont break it  or my world will fall apart heart-broken 
"tidal waves, they rip right through me  tears from eyes worn cold and sad  pick me up now, i need you so bad   heart-broken "
i have lost all hope of being normal once again  i will be a slave to you until the bitter end  even if its a hundred years before you change your mind  i will be here waiting until the end of time 
"if only he knew about the world without the bullshit and the lies  we couldve saved him, they couldve saved me  but instead im here drowning in my own fucking mind  and ill be damned if youre the death of me "
"these cuts that ive caused are never too deep to heal  peel back the bandage, see a scar from countless careless things "
"were the last words that i wrote for you, enough to tell you that, in my death the light that shown through my painful darkness was a blinding vision of your eternal smile?"
its a silent murder  its a grave that sings your song  its a quiet failure  its the one that makes you strong  we are heading down a long empty road  we pass lost souls blinded by the cold  watch the fire burn out  watch the curtains slowly close  waiting on the final words your heart already knows 
  i shouldve known better by now  but you look so damn good   run away from your mistakes  just like the ones you hid from me  why cant you see that i was e playful ecting this all along  
i cant go on without your love  you lost  you never held on 
cruel  cruel world  what more can you do? just come on  and break me down  if all is lost  then im ready to let go  just give me the word   and ill be gone  forever is a scary word  and i was ready for it once  and now again  but this time it has a  different meaning 
"hearing your voice on the phone, it makes me feel like im further from home   i miss how it feels when we touch  just like a papercut  the little things hurt so much  i cant go on cuz now youre not where i want you to be   heart-broken "
theres no use in lighting a fuse  so i save my rage for another day  and i lie in bed facing towards the stars  wishing i could fly away for good 
  just gonna stand there and watch me burn  but thats alright because i like the hurts  just gonna stand there and hear me cry  but thats alright because i love the way you lie  
"i am your hate, you are my love  i am your lust, you are my love drug  the one that cures me "
the pains of death can no longer haunt you as the dawning sky brings forth one forsaken thought death can not win for i now dwell in the palace of decay and i shall stay the hands of fate
its hard to wake up when the shades have been pulled shut  this house is haunted   it's so pathetic  it makes no sense at all  im ripe with things to say  the words rot and fall away  if a stupid poem could fix this home  id read it every day 
the life that i am force fed  im scared of the road ahead  have you listened to a word ive said?  the big picture is my dream is dead  
sigh 
sickkk):
sad 
today my inner child threw a tantrum because the voices in my head refused to share the sandbox of my mental playground 
was gonna go to <propfirst> but nooo   so fuck   maybe tomorrow or sumfin 
"i look alive, im dead inside  my heart has holes and black blood flows  we'll do some drugs we'll fall in love and get fucked up while the world just shrugs  with no thought logically, were wondering the streets so aimlessly  i hate to see these kids just being put down so painlessly "
and it took so long just to feel alright  remember how to put back the light in my eyes  i wish i had missed the first time that we kissed  cause you broke all your promises 
"i might drive myself insane if those lips aren't speakin my name  cause i got some intuition, or maybe im superstitious  but i think you're a pretty sweet pill\that im swallowing down "
just run away from these lies  back to yesterday  safe tonight  heart-broken 
im in lockport for a few days smile  hit me up 1309-550-4971 i love youuu love 
are you gonna eat those tots
"i'd die tonight\if only you were here\i'd tell you i'm sorry\i'd fucking disapear\\betrayed,\you look so pretty now\without me\alone\the tears come crashing down "
i need to find my place  but it might not be here where i feel safe   love 
"so follow me to the empty ocean we can watch the city descend behind the skylight  on our backs we float away and forget about the way it use to be  tonight, i fail  but i never wanted you to drown without me  tonight, we are the only ones to watch it fall apart "
"the colors of her mind bleed into each other  and as the morning melts the night  and the stars enchant another  while her eyes are still held shut she can hear a still, small voice  your words <propfemale> in her mind and your words are clear  and she knows youre here "
"i tried to tell you but i failed once again,\i truly can't have you simply being my friend,\i dream of you nightly, and even during the day,\i wish i could just tell you that i feel this way   heart-broken "
"within me you can fall apart\leaving pieces of your lonely heart\with novacaine so i cant feel\within me you can see a hole\a heart that lies in falling snow\but not to numb to let you know\broken glass, shattered ice\this is what im holding in\even though the show is over\youâ€™re still in the audience\although you didnâ€™t take this well\in time youll be able to tell\i just saved you from myself"
and here at the end at the end of the hurt  all the pain aint the same when its your turn to burn   i can not stand who i am  with this blood on my hands  in this blood i am damned
"i know some things that you dont \ive done things that you wont \thereâ€™s nothing like a trail of blood \to find your way back home"
"treading water with weights around my neck\a shipwreck of reckless accidents\overboard and i'm about to quit\head first, high dive in this deep end\abandon ship, because it's sinking way too quick heart-broken "
you brought me death  and its all i ever wanted  
i see you  you see right through me  ):
"i'd give it all just to have, have your eternity  cause it's all that assures me \it's worth all that hurts me  i'd give you my heart, and i'd let you just hold it \i'd give you my soul, but i already sold it  on that day, that day i walked away in december  i will always remember  i'll regret it forever  i remember brown eyes, so sad and blue skies  turned to darkness and night  i'm so sick of the fight "
fml 
i like you smile 
if i died   whats one thing you would have wanted me to know?
my hearts on an auction  it goes out to the highest bid   smile 
"baby, im a monster "
"this sensations overwhelming, give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright  tell me that i won't feel a thing  so give me novacaine"
i dont suffer from insanity   i enjoy every minute of it 
love me 
im a sad panda 
"theres a girl in my mirror crying tonight, and theres nothing i can say to make her feel alright  heart-broken "
"theres a party in my pants, and youre invited  wink "
"my heart longs for you, my soul dies for you, my eyes cry for you, my empty arms reach out for you "
i hate you  sad 
"back home, off the run\singing songs that make you slit your wrists\it isn't that much fun, staring down a loaded gun\so i won't stop dying, won't stop lying \if you want i'll keep on crying\did you get what you deserve? \is this what you always want me for?"
stick that in your juice box and suck it 
will you be my <propfirst>?
"im alone and i dont see a <propmale> to fix this head so just give up  write me off, pretend i dont exist  theres something in an empty bed that makes it hard to close your eyes  it can eat at you until they both turn black and blue and all you want is a reason you should live or a way for you to die "
turn my insides out and smother me 
and the worst part is before it gets any better were heading for a <propmale> and in the free fall i will realize im better off when i hit the bottom  heart-broken 
"i'm still afraid of ghosts that can see me\they know my thoughts, they read my mind\beside myself i judge my condition\i close my eyes but can't go blind\i'm feeling all the heat, all the chaos\it's gotten underneath my skin\so far to go to reach an absolution\my sanity, my soul runs thin"
"those painful times so alone, so ashamed\im not coming back\theres nothing to gain"
empty 
couldnt possibly ever stop missing you 
"among these ruins of our life\i walk slowly, sufferings tearing me\flashes hurt my mind\i see you everywhere, i can't forget you\the rain is falling out, the wind is whispering\the world's turning dark, the ambient cold\i feel your presence, your arms around me\your head on my back\i killed myself to join you"
so lonely without you   
feels like she has no friends  
   its all the same
lost 
im so fucking sick of people   i absolutely hate being ignored   ditched   uninvited   left out   it fucking sucks   and what sucks more is being kicked out of your own home for ''taking up too much space'' thanks    
"me: -holds <propfirst> in arms- im out of lube  this may sting a little   \<propfirst>: what?!\me: shhh   just let it happen  \<propfirst>: what the fuck are you talking about\me: -lets go of <propfirst>  walks away- all in good time <propfirst>  all in good time  "
is in your closet waiting for you to fall asleep  
my heart hurts  
so come and take me away from this monster that youve made of me  i feel like dying  erasing all of these memories  
theres another world inside of me  that you may never see  theres secrets in this life that i cant hide   somewhere in this darkness theres a light that i cant find  maybe its too far away  or maybe im just blind  
ughhh mom just made me eat a brussel sprout *puke*
<propmale> died):
"hiding behind the shadows\i'll be waiting in the dark\to drive this blade straight through your heart\i'll drag your body to the car\as blood races down my arm\i think everyone will wonder where you are tonight \i'll hide you in my walls\your body will never be found\i'll wear your skin as a suit, pretend to be you\your friends will like you more then they used to "
they say time is a healer  its more like a concealer for a scar  cuz it never really leaves us 
hold me close  im falling faster  tell me this could last forever   heart-broken
