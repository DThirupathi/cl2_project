is enjoying being in seattle for the first time 
some days are good  some are not  then there are those that are good and end up    much less so 
is very contemplative about life right now   
feels very alone   
today is a decent day so far   joyful 
is sad to have done the full black makeup yesterday only to have missed over half of the event  but still worth it 
wonders why everybody seems to be planning stuff to happen on july 25th   
"wonders why so many people want to betray or abandon each other in this world, be it in real life or as part of a game that's supposed to help you forget about real life for a while?"
needs to stare at a blank white wall for a few hours    too many scattered thoughts to collect and figure out 
needs to make a mythic character specific facebook account 
is contemplative on the nature of happiness   
gave in and made a character account for myzra 
my cell phone died and refuses to charge  that coupled with getting stranded by my car dying three times over the course of the weekend made it an adventure    soooo sorry to those who i had plans with that fell through because i was stuck without a way t
is realizing that some conversations are the most difficult because they are the most necessary in helping us to grow as individuals 
wants <propfirst> to hurry up and be done with work today so she can get to slc and have her phone working again  ~impatient~
"wants to go buy a red <propfemale> tied with a length of black ribbon to give to <propfirst>  it's how things started, it should either help him remember that time or be how it ends too "
"has decided that maybe her husband shouldn't have the option of divorcing her because he made a commitment of til death do us part, damnit!"
remembers why she doesn't tend to be more light hearted around people  sense of humor = fail  i'm going to go find a corner to brood in now   
"pappa was finally able to go home earlier this week, but will still be in a neck brace for a while yet "
is lividly furious with <propfirst>'s job for changing his schedule last minute so that our weekend plans completely fell through 
had a decent weekend in spite of missing the mythic event  happy to see my cat again for a little while   smile 
why do the best conversations where all defenses have been let down usually involve broken glass? admittedly this was my fault because the glass in the bridal picture broke for me and the bowl he threw didn't break because it landed in a box  but still   
curse you burger <propmale>! they got our order wrong and in the dark an onion was mistaken for lettuce until a nice big bite of it that i didn't catch in time  tonight there will be much pain and sickness   
really needs to find a hobby with less drama   
"keeps getting friend requests from people who know all of my friends, but i'm not sure if i remember ever meeting them before  o o'"
having daddy take me from just north of ogden to bountiful to get our car where it died: $15 in fuel  buying a new alternator for our car: $170  learning how to take an alternator out and then putting a new one in completely by myself except for reattaching the belt: priceless 
has found a certain level of serenity in working out at a gym with the husband   joyful 
actually likes obama and supports his health plan    i feel very alone in this sometimes 
can't wait to go to the gym again tonight with husband   laugh 
"is an addict  deactivated facebook for a while, but couldn't stand the social isolation "
has been back on facebook less than half an hour and is already thoroughly depressed from it again  such is the vicious social circle of life   
"is still in shock from learning that a friend has an inoperable brain tumor that won't kill them, but will give them migraines basically forever      o o"
"is amused to remember that she created her facebook account on march 10, 2008 because <propmale> h wanted more friends to help him on elven blood "
"lacks proper grammar in her last post, but brought some good <propfemale> into someone's life tonight  we saw a teenage boy walking from his truck with a blown out tire just north of clearfield on i-15  we took the next exit, flipped around and went back to pick him up  we then took him home to layton before heading home  i've missed being more helpful   laugh "
needs her stable life situation to somehow become established in the slc area    ~ponders~
the best kind of love is like pi    irrational and never-ending

fails by not noticing that facebook was logged into the husband's account when tagging people in pictures   annoyed '
wonders why so many people hate each other   
is happy that the internet is back up and working again!
"is not sure if her allergy to cats is less minor than before or if having her cat attack her face with claws just caused more of a reaction than normal  either way, happy to be visiting <propfirst>'s family in slc today "
finally found a design she really likes for a halloween costume  now to make it     smile 
is now coming up with ideas for what to do for her 4 year wedding anniversary in mid october    ~ponders~ <propfirst> <propfirst> iverson l- tell me more about your <propfemale> garden?
helped <propfirst> paint himself black as a xelaque today and then helped him wash it all off about 2 hours later  the e playful erience made him decide that he will never play a dark elf because he can't put up with the makeup  ~amused~
is enjoying simplicity in life 
is frustrated that she feels like she honestly can't be a part of her social circle anymore because of one person being so constantly hostile  ~sigh~
found some awesome fabric for only $2 a yard at wal*mart  sometimes evil corporations are still a good thing   playful 
you never realize how many friends you have until you are programming all of their <propfirst> into your new cell phone  but on the bright side i have a working cell phone again   love 
"is worried about mom-linda and becca now  neither has a job, both got their phones internet shut off earlier today and their <propfirst> got impounded for e playful ired plates  anyone need a new costume made right now to help my mother-in-law out with some income?  sad "
hooray for hanging out with family this weekend in slc   joyful 
sweet! after harassing my husband for long enough i finally got him to play his mmo today! yay warcrack!  laugh 
too frazzled    should be responsible and spend this weekend with family instead of playing mythic 
i think i've reached that point where i've been out of contact with people long enough that i'm now afraid of being around them again 
is lame  i forgot my surger at my in-laws house and am needing to make a costume before thursday   annoyed '
is really excited for her 4 year anniversary tomorrow   joyful

and <propfirst> had a lot of fun after the mythic realms open house  at the haunted mansion advertising with jareth and kat   joyful 
huh  tomorrow makes 5 days until my 28th birthday  i've been getting so caught up with stuff for halloween that i'd actually forgotten about it  o o'
thanks for all the birthday wishes   smile 
"family crisis averted, now i can focus on my life again "
is happy right now in spite of the fact that this definitely qualifies as a very bad week  tonight we find out if our transmission completely went out yesterday or just broke an internal seal  i am quite thankful that dad and <propmale> could tow our car home last night   joyful 
"today i finish wrapping all of the christmas presents, even though we could only afford to buy for family this year  it will be nice to have it done with   smile "
"if an argument can cause someone to delete you as a friend and then ignore it when you try to re-add them, i can take a hint for the slap in the face and get on with my life  it just makes me sad when people are so petty and over dramatic "
"is debating on a new years resolution  looking back over the past year, the thing i am most thankful for is to have remained married  i mourn with my friends who were less fortunate than <propfirst> and i  ~hugs~   sad "
"today is one of those days where you've been excited for plans for a while, go to the bank, realize you have about $100 less than you thought and suddenly the first <propmale> you've had to see more than one of your friends at a time since october 15th is on the chopping block  i'm going to go blow things up on a video game now "
"yesterday dad and i finally got the transmission out of my car  the internal seal had broken completely free and had been rattling loose around the shaft  hopefully it hasn't burned itself out  we'll get it completely put back together later today  a <propfirst> slipped and i looked over to see the front end teetering down on top of dad  my heart was in throat for a moment there, but everything was ok  o o'"
"getting a new phone number within the next month  was on a plan with dj and <propfirst> because i would babysit for them, but living so far away made a closer friend a better option for them  i will keep everyone updated on what my new number is once i get it  i'm excited by the prospect of <propfirst> and i both getting on a plan together and actually having two phones   smile "
"it lives! the new seal seems to be holding on the transmission and the damage wasn't severe enough to burn it out completely, just to make it a little tempermental  we have a working car again   laugh "
"family picture, christmas dinner and birthday party  <propfirst> works at midnight tonight  busy day "
i always forget how terrifying it is to drive in the snow until i do something like slide through a stop sign and almost hit a snow plow  thinking of cancelling my plans in slc tonight if it means driving home late on the ice   sad
