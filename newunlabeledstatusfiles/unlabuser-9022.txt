"found out the soup i just ate has bonito in it- a type of fish, we shall see how i feel in a few hours       "
"everyone hates us      sad  boo it's a saturday night, can everyone really be sleeping right now?!"
<propfemale> molner passed out on me without warning     sad  may be i should sleep too    
"i just want to enjoy life, is that really too much to ask for?!"
"i'm tired, and hungry, and whinny, and am going back to sleep cause that will at least delay and or fix most of these problems   \\ps: joining okc when you're drunk with your bff is not always a good idea  haha"
"3 hour nap, dreams of working <propfemale> <propfemale> shop- puddles on pillows to prove story    haha time (past due) to get up and get outta here to <propfemale> kopacek place for an evening of drinks and more catching up   then a night of driving around to find closer, free, parking near where i live   "
found free parking (but not always a guarantee) only 4 blocks from home  ^___^  yay! (residential parking permits are so e playful ensive ) nap time  then helping aleksey nelipa buy furniture 
"saw the owl movie and resident evil's new one,both in 3d thanks to <propfirst> <propfirst>   the owl one was cute and made the 4 year-old in me very happy, and well i love milla but i'd love to see all the films run together as one- these hangings and incomplete connections are starting to wear on me, which is saying a lot cause i really do love her films   "
"tried to figure out skype to stay in touch with a friend- 3 guys in minutes asked me to show my boobs  play cam games  wtf?! blocked    but really, i thought this kind of lack of class was done for by now     boo skype, boo   "
no food makes sleeping seem like a really good thing     back to dream land for me!
sweet dreams fbers  love   love 
off to clean house   
not a good day after all    fuck it 
gomen <propfemale>
i splurged on pizza- with coupons should last me a couple weeks worth of food   now that i have food in me i feel a bit better 
"moved boxes- not cleaned or organized, but a start- going out for the night- then need to rush back in am for delivery "
trying to make sense of things
i really wish it wasn't 2pm on a thursday already 
off to fight the b-line to work 
"i hate being in a place in my life where i cannot take care of my own simple just to live needs   this is f'n ridiculous   i'm an f'n joke, but i'm so tired i can't laugh anymore "
"it could be so much worse    i just need to build on what i have so far- step by step, right mama? ^_<"
someone actually emailed my boss about me taking wine sales to the next level in this store  so awesome!!  joyful 
it's so hot out!!! been in the mid 80s for 2 days now  wtf?!
"i just wanna stay in bed- but alas i must now get ready for work    maybe going out last night not such a good idea- but hey, it was fun!"
sooo tired                        -_-
"i paid my <propmale>s- yay- thanks to help from my dad all my <propmale>s for the next 2 weeks are paid   i'm completely broke, but hey, only till next thursday- oh wait then that goes to a different <propmale>- will the torture never end?! *shakes head*"
i think watching anime may be bad for my health   i keep hoping for a miracle where i get to power up and save the world  lol
the sky's looking like fall!
"sometimes when i cry for really no logical reason i wonder why, but maybe it's just my way of releasing, the way others get angry or do crazy and stupid things   "
gomen <propfemale> 
it's funny how mothers really do know you (or at least mine knows me very well) 
"there are a few people i've been trying to reach for a while now  even though we are fb friends as well, the messages here and cell texts have gone unanswered  even if it was to say they were upset for some reason (not even saying the reason), or just really busy, or just don't want to talk to me right now- i wish they'd at least respond  i wish they'd say hey what's up back, or at least let me know they still care "
"wow- after only about 2 months it took me 3 hours to clean the bathroom       -_- is it just me or has anyone else noticed how much more elbow grease one must use when using green cleaning products   i mean it was much nicer on hands and to breath than regular, but that took way too long  ^^;;"
may we all be spared zombies from our dreams tonight- ????????
"why am i never tired when it's actually time to sleep?- i've hardly been sleeping at all lately, but resting plenty to make up for it  and when i finally do fall asleep, i wake up early because of dreams or just my internal clock- so sad "
not enough sleep- shoots- i guess it will be starbucks stop for me on way to work today   
"if you can attain repose and calm, believe that you have seized happiness  \~by julie-jeanne-eleonore de lespinasse"
i'm really not looking forward to the next 9 5 hours    -_-
"purse latch broke, umbrella broke, raining, now wet, 2 trains pass me without stopping, running 20 minutes late to work now, i'm in a shitty ass pissed off mood and not wanting to be in a customer service job today! fml indeed, at least today  grrrrr x_x"
first full night's rest in well over a week! yay! almost 11 hours 
"good night, but i kinda wish i was asleep   "
what a sunday night!!
head and tummy hurt- two different reasons    great night though!
the fire alarm down the street has been going off for 2 hours now- headache not getting any better -_-
   
"i smell a fire and hear sirens, it must be really close  o o"

"feeling a little nostalgic as i lay to rest tonight    should make for interesting dreams    amai yume, <propfemale> "
"thank you for all your support, both large and small, over the long years or since we just met- i really appreciate having so many brilliant and kind people in my life "
i like it wherever it ends up being 
funny how anime gives me a fulfilled feeling nothing much else in my life does right now  guess every girl really does just want to live a fairy-tale   
"i want my happily ever after <propfemale> tale life so bad, it hurts  pathetic and childish,  i know, but one can't change how they feel  it's taken me years, but i finally understand that now   "
"trying to find a balance, i need to find my balance "
tossed and turned all night- maybe 4 hours?

"wow- it's 50 degrees out right now     hello fall, when did you get here?"
"i liked falling asleep to the sound of rain last night- much better than the party going on across the street, just out my window right now   "
can't wait to see everyone coming to today's wine bash! ^___^
party time!!! if you find yourself bored and in the brighton area- come on over!
