definitely the most interesting night in a while   
"\shut up <propmale> warmer \"""""
people care about college football? can't wait until sunday!!!
wonders what it's like to love her job  people are such assholes 
important e playful eriences are not necessarily positive ones

"those mouse trap commercials that say \guaranteed to kill the mouse\"" depress me """
idle hands   
"okay, now i can admit ginn is part of the team "
i wonder who on the saints blew that ref 
hates being lied to  more than anything 
please please me 
"it's all false love and affection  i don't like you, i just want the attention "
my fucking tongue hurts 
is going to kill herself if the jets win 
all i do is win 
"\he's pretty cute \"" '            still here   ' <propfemale> collado"""
"loves <propfemale> espinal, <propfemale> joojeh rodriguez, <propfemale> olmeda, and <propmale> w peon way too much  smile "
hello spring break  excited to start with 4 nights of work!  smile 
relationships are about compromise  lets just agree to disagree   with the stupid shit you keep saying 
i can resist everything except temptation 
how the fuck does it shine green it doesn't have no batteries!
"just gonna stand there and watch me burn, but that's alright because i like the way it hurts  just gonna stand there and hear me cry, but that's alright because i love the way you lie "
"harsh words hurt feelings, but silence breaks hearts "
"fuck you, i know shit!"
loves too hard 
"no sabes como duele la <propfemale>, no sabes como duele tu adios  yo se que nisiquiera imaginas el dano que me has hecho, mi amor  no sabes como duele perderte, no sabes como duele aceptar que para mi es urgente ol<propfemale>rte, y no tengo valor para empezar "
i want you so bad i'll go back on the things i believe 
"all in all i learned a lesson from it though   you never see it coming, you just get to see it go "
"sometimes, fate throws two people together only to rip them apart  sometimes a person finally makes the right choice   but the timing is all wrong  and as they say   timing is everything "
trust your heart if the seas catch fire   and live by love though the stars walk backward 
they say you can't judge a book by it's cover   but i'm pretty sure that's only if you plan to read it 
"it's so insane 'cause when it's going good it's going great, but when it's bad it's awful "
i have a really bad case of streaking-opia 
"you trained me not to love, after you taught me what it was "
i like it on the dryer ; )
everyone getting on that kik tip 
"i'm ashamed to say that i'm to blame for the way you act, 'cause i just keep coming back "
fuck the pain away 
"with you iâ€™m in my fuckinâ€™ mind, without you, iâ€™m out it "
"rip abuelo <propmale>, the only real grandfather i ever had  i miss you already  i love you "
so i hate the jets and the patriots  still a loss since the stadium didn't collapse like i was hoping
