don't you love it when a song just finds that spot inside you where you have to dance? when it has the perfect funky beat and you feel like busting it old school! oh yeah!
damn  i really hate almost being able to hate someone that i really want to hate and despise for no good reason other than that they have something they don't deserve that i sometimes wish i had   matbe i shouldn't post this   maybe i should stop talking to myself through the keyboard and just have a verbal self argument about morals and whether hate or extreme displeasure is an appropriate response in that situation

"ugh, i'm such a horrible communicator  i understand people easy, and i can read most people like a book  but i suck at communicating what i'm thinking"
"i hate lol! i hate loling! i hate lolers  i hate the whole lolering system! i propose we ban lol from our schools, our cell phones, our facebook pages! listen to me people! together! we can stop this   lolorist attack that has destroyed our nation!"
