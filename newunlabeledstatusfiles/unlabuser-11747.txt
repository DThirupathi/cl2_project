"despicable me was very cute  made me want my very own minions  boyfriend says he will see to it  hogs breath is always fun especially when the <propmale> <propmale> band is playing  but best part of the night, hands down, was drag <propfemale> night at coasters  good times "

i am going to try to quit smoking starting this weekend  eep  wish me luck!
"today is my quit day  3 cigs left and when they are gone, they are gone  here's to saving over $150 a month!"
"still not smoking  i feel fine, really  haven't even wanted one since i quit  i can feel the withdrawal symptoms but they are not bad at all  <propfirst> is having a much harder time with it than i  he really wants a cigarette  but he is as determined as i am  so far so good!"
actually feels like a non-smoker now  i've started coughing up all the gunk out of my lungs  that's really cute 
"found out i get tonight off of work  yay, i can catch up on some sleep  i love surprises "
"yes, i know they are chocolate chip but they are also oatmeal and that has to count for something        "
"ew, stress  i can't sleep  didn't sleep well last night or the night before and i have to work tonight and i can't get in a nap  i hate being so worried about so many things  i need a chill pill "

"ok, so  i finally broke the news to my parents so it can now become public knowledge  like a month ago probably i said something really stupid on here, and jinxed myself  probably only like 3 people read it, but it was something like \that is something that would only happen if i were pregnant"," which i'm not!!!\""\"efdc1 laugh d1f4f2a6924cbd0eb22393caa,"facebook is stupid  there's not enough space to write long stuff  i kind of miss myspace for that \\anyway, i burned the roof of my mouth last night eating a jalapeno bite from arby's  \\totally worth it \\on a related note, i now have bronco <propfirst> sauce in my purse  i am officially acting pregnant "
"<propfirst>'s parents took me shopping for maternity clothes today  i now have a more stylish and extensive maternity wardrobe than non-maternity  not that that's saying much  i have a tendency to buy my clothes at thrift stores and yard sales  never in my life has someone taken me to a store and told me \get whatever you want \"" it's kind of a weird feeling  there are no words for my gratitude """
"the combination of quitting smoking and being pregnant has made my sense of smell so powerful, so acute, that i am pretty sure it can now be considered a superpower  wait     do you smell popcorn? cause i smell popcorn "
wow i've been having some weird dreams lately  i thought it was my sleeping pills but it turns out it's pregnancy  i had a scary dream today and scared myself awake 
"urgh  so sick of drama  this is what happens when you are around a bunch of women all the time  no offense women, but you are crazy  and yeah, i'm including myself in that  i'm just so tired of being a nice person and being e playful ected to put up with crap because i'm nice  how much bs can one person be e playful ected to take? so glad my home life is drama free, well, for the most part "

"first trimester will be over in another week  i can't believe it! belly is starting to poke out a little  showing earlier with this one than either of the others, but that's not unusual  also, i found a home for cheerio  no thanks to any of you!"
"i think i am going to have to break down and let the boyfriend take pictures of me today  i have been doing a combination of whining and pretending to be asleep to avoid it thus far, but i am running out of excuses  plus his grandmother sent us a bunch of stuff and all she wants in return is pictures of me  my guilt is starting to outweigh my camera-avoidance tendencies  blah "
"boyfriend got me a kindle for christmas and, being himself, couldn't wait 2 months to give it to me, so i have a kindle! yay!!!! it is a thing of beauty and a joy forever and i am in loooooove! if you don't know what a kindle is, it is a really neat little gadget that amazon sells to read books  i am still reading the user guide and learning how to work it, but i am so excited  best present ever! he knows me so well!"
"my parents were mean to me when i was a kid! they made me do chores and go to school  they gave me a curfew, made me get a job and work for the things i wanted  they insisted that i do my best at school and my job and take pride in my work  i grew up with morals, respect for my elders, a good work ethic and respect for the law  i thank god everyday for my mean parents! (copy and paste if you agree)"
"i ordered a pizza and the pizza guy was dressed up as a cop for halloween  imagine my surprise when the police delivered my pizza!\\on a related note: yum, pizza!"

sometimes i really wish i was better at fighting  my peace-keeping nature has really gotten the best of me  why can't i just be mean sometimes?
"baby is starting to wiggle  or i should say, i am starting to feel baby's wiggles  still can't feel it from the outside though "
"did you ever e playful ect something to be much worse than it actually ends up being? you get all geared up for something bad, then it's not bad at all and you have all this built up aggression and nowhere for it to go  it's so anticlimactic, it's almost disappointing "
i also think it's pretty awesome that i can have a conversation about maggots while eating rice without getting grossed out  just sayin  my superpower is that i can't be grossed out 
"i haven't been on here in a while  i have no computer right now  i should have one soon  in other news, it's a boy!!!!!"
"yay, thanks to my wonderful man (and his dad) i have a computer once again! it's nice knowing people who are good with technology, since i am pretty much stupid when it comes to electronic thingies "
started taking prevacid yesterday for the awful awful heartburn that i have been having  haven't had a twinge of heartburn since i took the first pill  it said on the label it can take 1 to 4 days to start working  nice to have something work the way it's supposed to for once!
"remember <propfemale> harbor today  remember the surprise of the first plane coming into the harbor on the quiet morning of december 7, 1941  remember your grandfathers, uncles, brothers, dads, anyone who fought to give us freedom (and those who are still fighting for our freedom)  because of them you are able to sit on facebook right this very second  always count your blessings ?\\miss you granddaddy!"
"you guys! i got a new baby! my dad had bought a rat for my sister's snake, but her snake died (rip, so sorry <propfemale>) before it could eat the rat  so i took the rat home and it is my new pet! it's just a little baby, so i don't know whether it is a boy rat or a girl rat, but so far its name is <propmale> because it's a lucky rat  if it's a girl it will be felicity "

"the christmas party was fun  sucks for you if you work with me and didn't go! if you weren't there, we all talked crap about you the whole time cause you suck!"
