just got home from a long and tiring day at work!  feels good to sit down and relax!
can't believe its been ten years since i graduated highschool!  was added to the bhs reunion group 
"so apparently there is a 13th zodiac sign  which i had no idea about!\the original creators only wanted 12 zodiac's (12 months) so they got rid of the 13th one  but now astronomers are actually counting it in now  the status was to long so i put it below!"
"kids with special needs aren't sick, or gross  they only want what everyone wants to be accepted  can i make a request? is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour? it is special education week, and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way  you never understand a situation until you are faced with it  god bless everyone who has a special need child "
"if you have a wonderful partner, who helps balance your whole world, who isn't perfect, but is perfect for you, who works hard, would do anything for you, who makes you laugh, drives you crazy, is your best friend, you want to grow old with, who you are thankful for everyday, and who you could not live without then post this as your status!  i love you so much <propmale> marsh !"
my mom has made me laugh      wiped my tears      hugged me tight     watched me succeed     seen me fall     cheered me on     kept me going strong     and     drove me a little crazy at times      but mom's are a promise from god that you will have a friend forever! put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful mom whom you love!  i love you so much mom!
