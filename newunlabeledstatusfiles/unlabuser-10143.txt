i would like college a lotttt more if there was less reading 
one word strikes fear and panic into the hearts of college students everywhere: homework 
it is sad when all your money is mentally spent before you even get it! bills stink   
"isn't life funny? people including myself always complain when we are too busy and wish for more free time, yet when most of us get too much free time on our hands we get bored and wish to be busy again! is there no happy-medium?"
i feel that you are only allotted a certain amount of concentration molecules  mine are used up for the day  time to reboot
