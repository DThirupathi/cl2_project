red leaves blow in the wind--leaving home and everything it's known behind barren branches wave goodbye--as the red leaves slowly die--every flower stares and watches--as the wind takes me away--before the sun shone upon me--now the wind takes me away--red leaves falling--through the branches--making their way to the ground--blowing by the flowers sleeping no one knows the leaves are leaving
