"a book is like a box, a box has six sides, inside and outside,                                                       but how do you get to whats inside? how do you get to whats inside out?"
had an awesome movie night with the fbf   smile 
it's better to be happy alone than unhappy with someone 
"i'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure  i make mistakes, i am out of control and at times hard to handle  but if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best "
i never felt settled or calm  you can't really commit to life when you feel that 
i can't wait to move!! i'll be so much happier 
"we've got our backs against the ocean  it's just us against the world  looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and i  let's take a <propmale>, go far away, today & never look back again "
