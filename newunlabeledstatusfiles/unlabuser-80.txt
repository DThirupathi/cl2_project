"sometimes people are nice because that is genuinely who they really are    the only thing weird about it is that people assume when you are nice there must be another reason  i am nice because i want to be  it is a choice  i choose to be happy  if you are an unhappy person, get to know yourself better and figure out what will make you happy (realisticly)  do not look to others to define who you are  silly humans!!"

"lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls  but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves  for if any be a hearer and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in glass  <propfirst> 1:21-23"
