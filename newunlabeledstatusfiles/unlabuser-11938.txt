an all-nighter on a saturday night is just plain pathetic 
all-nighter   here i come 
"can't wait for the end of may  calcutta, north bengal and hiking!"
"affan mian, javed siddique narejo don't kill yourselves    you guys weren't *too* bad "
completed tax returns  yay 
so watching first person shooter games nauseates me   who knew this was at the root of my video-game-phobia
