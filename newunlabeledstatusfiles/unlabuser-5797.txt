stealing some wifi on my lunch break to wish all a good new year 
"there is no such thing as real love anymore  everybody is too wrapped up in themselves to give any part of them to anybody  even when you know you love someone, i can guarantee you they don't love you  people have forgotten how to care for one another "

"~ not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced ~"
"~ the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched, they must be felt with the heart ~"
~ when you are in love you can't fall asleep because reality is better than your dreams ~
"~ a positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort ~"
"~ some of the greater things in life are unseen, thats why you close your eyes when you kiss, cry, or dream    ~"
"~ i love you, not for what you are, but for what i am when i am with you ~"
"~ you come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly ~"
~ the worst tempered people i have ever met were those who knew that they were wrong ~
~ anger is like those ruins which smash themselves on what they fall ~
"~ stubbornness does have its helpful features, you always know what you are going to be thinking tomorrow ~"
~ temper is a weapon that we hold by the blade ~
~ success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it ~
"~ sometimes your nearness takes my breath away; and all the things i want to say can find no voice  then, in silence, i can only hope my eyes will speak my heart ~"
wishing you all a happy mother's day!!!!!!!!!!!!
~ he who wakes up and finds himself a success hasn't been asleep ~
~ no one is as angry as the person who is wrong ~

~ when birds fight it is the ears that suffer; but when people fight it is the children who suffer ~
~ anger is an acid that can do more harm to he vessel in which it is stored; than to anything on which it is poured ~
~ he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition will waste his life in fruitless efforts ~
"~ my riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in the fewness of my wants ~"
~ nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude ~
~ anger itself does more harm than the condition which aroused anger ~
"~ the more anger towards the past you <propfemale> in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present ~"
~ hell hath no fury like a woman scorned ~
"~ an optimist may see a light where there is none, but why must the pessimist always run to blow it out? ~"
"~ if you judge people, you have no time to love them ~"
~ no one can make us angry  people can say and do things to us but it is still up to us as individuals to do what we want with our emotions in response to those things ~
"~ a wise man changes his mind, a fool never will ~"
~ any person capable of angering you becomes your master  he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him ~
"~ keep your heart right, even when it is sorely wounded ~"

"~ if you have it love, you don't need to have anything else, and if you don't have it, it doesn't matter much what else you have ~"
"~ they say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world  someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for ~"
~ the man who complains about the way the ball bounces is likely the one who dropped it ~
~ occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely e playful lained by those symbols called words  their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart ~
~ pure love is a willingness to give without a thought of receiving anything in return ~
"~ love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction ~"
"~ love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear ~"
~ there are two kinds of fools: those who can't change their opinions and those who wont ~
"~ a fool despises good counsel, but a wise man takes it to heart ~"
"~ in the absence of love, there is nothing worth fighting for ~"
~ once a women has given you her heart you can never get rid of the rest of her ~
~ keep love in your heart  a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead ~
"~ but true love is a durable fire, in the mind ever burning  never sick, never old, never dead  from itself never turning ~"

~ it's how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success ~
><<>>< not to believe in love is a great sign of dullness  there are some people so indirect and lumbering that they think all real affection must rest on circumstantial evidence ><<>><
people should be more concerned when someone doesn't take the time to point out potential wrongs flaws or dislikes   if they were to tell you that you were perfect and nothing was wrong or bothering them    surely they are not only lying to you   but them self as well
