mythology    i know its weird     yet interesting 
what i'm goign to do after working on my birthday for my birthday 
wondering what to do on my days off for my birthday since i'm working on my birthday 
just confused about life
nights come and go just like the days pass 
"work in a hour    well, gotta make money some how "
love and respect your enemies for they could become your best asset 
liking how the world is trying to look up
"fueled by hope, and yes its a renewable source of energy "
i'm going in       and im gonna go hard!?! into work that is   
"there is never a permanent shortcut, eventually things will make you take the long way about in order to get a result you didn't e playful ect "
trying to get in the halloween spirit 
turkey time    eh? maybe if i feel like cooking
what? moving on upppp to a deluxe grease station in the skkkyyyyy
what? bored thats it
"and make it rain, and make it rain    lol damn  american dad clip been stuck in my head all day "
"bored, tired of work for what seems like nothing and single    holidays suck"
damn its cold  and holidays still tend to suck lol 
"even though times get harder and harder i'm still here  when the world throws everything i have away, i still have just what i need to get by "
"i'm tired of dealing with people  act like they got love for you then they treat you like shit when you decide to stop doing things for them  say they appreciate you then turn another and forget about you   this change will come, because you brought it on yourself "
february    needs to end    asap  money is on the vikings for nfc superbowl spot  <propmale> out with cousins and the baby 
"lets see    saints beat the vikings, my ipod finally broke, i've caught a bad cold and     work today  yup greatest day ever "
feeling better slowly    
damn    last comment was january 27th     lets see  nothing has changed 
"i ain't a killer but, don't push me  revenge is the sweetest joy next to that one thing  only god and parents can judge me  only god can deliever the final judgement upon me "
*insert smart assed comment about life here* *insert wise quote here* sleeping then working the weekend away 
"i really do think my manager does intentionally try to piss me off to get me fired somedays  i already know i'm going to hear some bullshit tomorrow but, i really don't give a shit "
working   funny the rain picks up just as i walk out the house 
"look at the world, see it through the eyes of a someone that has nothing  afterwards look at the world through your own eyes  learn to appreciate those that offer assistance and you in turn will be appreciated for just being who you are "
"people say everything about anyone to everyone   your friends laugh at it and encourage it  do you really think that person doesn't do the exact same thing to you when you aren't around or when you upset them? then you are a fool   i'm just going to do what necessary, say what i need to say, and keep it moving "
"work    as usual  afterwards? home, maybe a movie     sleep    repeat "
"people piss me off, still i just try to smile and laugh it off because in the end    people will still piss me off "
getting ready for work    back at it  lets hope this week is better 
lol    this weekend i  live at work     in a way i guess that counts as a better weekend 
the best help tends to come from those you dont e playful ect it from  so yeah    thank you for your help 
"learning something new everyday at work about work   need to keep my focus because when i make it to the top, i dont want to be that one that stabbed everyone in the back "
of this life    i want to die having not a single regret 
craving a frappe    i blame mcdonalds for this 
"what's on my mind: stressful, getting a drink, alot of perverted shit oh and money   work soon "
"i sold all my money    gave away food away when i was hungry    and prayed for enemies that don't love me  trust me, god appreciates it when you live humbly "
"tired of all this shit, can't sleep    been up since i got home from work last night    seriously  fuck it "
oh shit son  lol
i blame my cousin got me listening to 3 6 this damn late  ughhh
n> a new pc 
"the path is long and hard  you will bleed and you will fall  there will be tears and pain, but if you pick yourself back up and keep pushing yourself, you will see the light that you were looking? for at the end of the tunnel "
oooh shiiit sonnn!?!
funny the jobs that pay the lowest require more work 
"was at it all week, time to unwindd~"
"my attitude is \fuck it\"" and you motherfuckas love it """
"it was my? only wish to rise, above these jealous, coward mother fuckers i despise "
do you know why i took the position of crew leader considering my disdain for everyone? is it all about the extra 20 cents ever hour? maybe its the idea that i can finally make a difference in that god  forsaken hell hole called hardee's?    trust me its all about the 20 cents 
"i really do not like hospitals, they remind me of death "
feeling better 
cooking meat with big meech
thanks to all those that wished me happy birthday  it is truly appreciated 
people never learn about things until its too late  always pay attention to subtle comments from bosses and employees 
"you are always tormented by an inability to relate   \ to others   people do respect you, are excited to affiliate wit you, \and see you as very deep, but it's hard for you to appreciate this   you\ often feel that nobody really understands you, and you look inward for \answers when you've already tried looking toward others "
how about them cowboysss!?!
finally feeling better and getting hours back at the job  lets get some bills caught up again 
"same ol shit, just a different day "
talking to myself because i am my own consultant
