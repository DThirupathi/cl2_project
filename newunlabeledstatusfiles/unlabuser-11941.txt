had a bunch of fun at barnes and <propmale>  ran into a few nerds 
<propmale> criss is going to be on glee  i think my heart just e playful loded 
"bahaha, i am having way too much fun with this  you can type your password out as a post or comment and it will come up as stars when you share it! haha ******* hahaha   i'm such a 6 year old "
"new goal: read every one of the average wizard posts, starting on <propfemale> 830 "
sometimes i feel like a facebook stalker because i realize that i know pretty much everything that anyone puts on facebook  then i remember that it was you that put it there  i'm only fulfilling your e playful ectations by acknowledging it 
does this work for you dear?
"<propfemale> lovegood was right, the things we lose, really do, have a way of coming back to us in the end "
"never stop dreaming, because if you stop dreaming, you're just sleeping "
i love being able to walk into a zombie apocalypse 
has been hacked by <propfemale> erickson smile 
anyone have a parent who wants to take me to new york next month?
it's halloween and i am not in a costume  i want to cry 
"now instead of seeing two people's wall posts, you can see their \friendships\""    staking is going to be a lot easier now """
"so, i'm considering doing miss fts for the sole reason to wear combat boots with a dress  any other ideas for possible epic un-pageant things i could also do?"
"so    i'm on my computer, and i actually have quite a few windows open and randomly the opening song from a very potter musical just started playing  i have no idea where it is coming from, but i am not complaining "
off to the quidditch world cup!
muggle quidditch world cup 2010
go harvard horntales!
i will never be able to look at brooms the same way again 
has everyone ran out of enough creativity to come up with their own facebook status'? boredom is not an excuse 
"please put this on your status if you know someone who has been eaten by a dragon  dragons are nearly unstoppable and, in case you didn't know, they can breathe fire  93% of people won't copy and paste this, because they have already been eaten by a dragon  6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers, and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this "
"so, i'm going to watch lost again "
"i love how <propmale> potter can connect random people  a perfect example would be the quidditch world cup, where i could be walking blocks away from the field and pass someone who was also wearing a gryffindor scarf and we would have a moment of excitement in the middle of the street "
is this more exciting?! or does it just seem like i'm weird?!!
please come back to life tumblr 
"so, now the latest 'status trend' is to put a number down to (for the most part) be lied to? \oh what a significant difference\"" """
i will demolish you all in snake   just wait   
"just typed in gibberish to save a photo, and it somehow matched with past gibberish that i had typed for another photo   i had to re-gibber "
anyone involved with the theatre who is free tonight at 6 and wants to work spot? hmm? haha
it seems like every other status is about hatred for study island   i thought i was done with that once i left 71st    i was wrong    so wrong    
<propfirst> long and i got 2nd place at forensics today  we were pretty amazing if i say so myself 
had a great weekend  sometimes selling my soul to the theatre pays off 
"all of these day challenges? yeah, that's a tumblr thing, and a majority of you will not finish them "
"like this status, if, and only if, you are completely done with your share "
