so last night i was contemplating what the opposite of fear is  after some time i came up with what i think is a good answer  so i ask you all what your theories might be  i'm interested if any of you will come up with a more appropriate answer than i  i truly believe it to be boredom 
trying to psych myself up for school  pun intended  yarrr
first day of school down  interesting to say the least  am the only white boy to take african american studies  right now the vain in my head is pulsing to the tempo of a throbbing rave beat  and here i am without an e'd up girl rubbing on me  fml
there are days when i don't know why i even made the effort to crawl out of bed  this is one of those days  in spades
it's amazing how watching a good hack and slash is enough to lift the spirits after a totally farked up day

illumination is dependant upon the constancy of new questions  answers only allow the brain to get mired in a tarpit of surety
am enjoying this lovely lazy day by watching an old favorite: boondock saints  if you have not seen this epic film yet get thee to a rental place post haste

i'm actually sitting here trying to come up with a witticism that will perfectly e playful ress the type of day i had  this was it  fml 
"it's been a year now that i've decided to take control of the wheel and direct my own path  it has not been easy but i have gotten passed a huge hurdle on the track that is my life  i know i'm mixing up \symbology\"" (  playful  ) but i seem to only be full of these predictable axioms as of this hour  the fact of the matter is that i'm not who i was and i don't know who i'll end up being  i am alive and my eyes are open """
a true seeker of wisdom knows that it comes not from the answer but from the question

so these girls in my class called me <propfirst> in front of my homeboy <propfirst>  he told me it's cause i look like leisure suit <propfirst>  this was not the case for them but now all my friends say this is my lookalike  you be the judge

last night my bed became my enemy for the first time in a long time  the battle was epic  it lasted for seven hours and in the end i was victorious 
no rest for the wicked and the righteous need none  i haven't yet figured out which of these descriptions is more fitting of me 
i will not fear  fear is the mind killer  i will face my fear  i will let it pass through me

"three finals down and one to go on thursday  got the digits of a chick i've been talking up this last semester  she seems intelligent, has a great personality and is not lacking in the physical attractiveness department  i think she's a little closer to my age, so hopefully no little games to bust through  where it goes from here is anybody's guess "
just found out i got a d in my fucking psych class  wtf  i am not a happy boy  now i have to take the damn thing all over again  fuck my life !!!!!!
risk is a funny thing  when it led to destructive behaviour on my part is was easier to partake of  now that it might have positive consequences it is really hard to get up the chutzpuh 
so tomorrow is my final for my african american history class  feelin a <propmale> nervous as it is going to be a written exam  the silver lining to tomorrow is that i've got a rendez vous set up with a chick from one of my health science classes  fingers crossed 
finito  feels good to be done  totally misread the situation w  the girl from one of my classes and made a fool of myself  que sera sera 
good food and good drink with good people  who could ask for a better sunday evening

"if a djinn came up to me and told me i could have but one wish, it would be to be rid of this damnable sinus headache that has been plagueing me for the last few days "
is it wrong to want to devour an entire species thus bringing about their extinction and thereby gaining superiority of an entire world? i think not!!!
woke up today to sheer hell  <propfemale>'s neices decided to watch a linkin park concert  white boy rap + emo lyrics + mook rock dynamics = murderous thoughts coming immediately to the fore of my mind

it's only one o' clock in the pm and i'm coompletely ready to be done with this day 
sometimes i make the mistake of looking up from what i'm focused on to get a look at the big picture  i know i should keep my head down and not worry about the greater whole but i get antsy and have to let my gaze roam  i'm about to turn 34 and it scares the hell out of me that i don't have a single thing sussed out  i wonder if i ever will 
"opininons are like kittens, i was givin' them away "
"right, in 11 hours i will be 34 years old  not quite sure about this aging thing  the passage of time gets to be a bit of a drag  especially when you've pissed so many years away "

"right, first week of school is passed  only 17 more to go  i don't know what i was thinking when i signed up for polisci at 8 in the morn  speech looks to be a fun class and as long as i restrict my tangents i should do great  i just hope my friend is able to add it  if not i won't have anyone to help me make fun of the people who are totally oblivious "

it is a brilliant day!!! today i turned two years old  it's hard to believe it's been that long  it's funny how something that seemed like it would be the hardest thing to do has gotten me this far  mad love to all those who've supported me in thoat dark time and helped me get through 
so  i've come a long way  then that voice that isn't really mine starts telling me i've got so much farther to go in order for me to lead a life of fulfilment  i'm trying sooo hard to live in the now but it's hard to give up some habits 
'bout to get me hair dyed  have not yet decided upon a colour 
the breakthroughs just keep on coming!
straight twisted!
i'm baaack 
all your base are belong to us
went to therapy yesterday and did not recieve the validation i had e playful ected  i thought it would be the best avenue to take  apparently it would be a cop-out  fml 
nine is not a high enough number!
?
"striving towards the ideal of radical acceptance  understanding that no matter what happens, that was the way it was meant to be "
going to spend the entire day wif me girl 
"just got back from an awesome night! got to catch true grit, which we absolutely loved, and some great chinese  life is beautiful!"
"so many good things are happening  i'm in a brilliant relationship, an old friend is coming back to town and my niece is coming home!"
jus' got finished making meself pretty  about to go out and enjoy arthop with my girl 
getting ready to have a time with a bunch of mates  life is so unbelievably exciting right now!
"had an amazing time last night  did it proper for a homies birthday, went dancing( something i haven't enjoyed for some time, now), and played some pool  an altogether enjoyable e playful erience "
let the healing begin
i think i'm gonna be okay 
"i understand that forgiveness is a difficult thing to give  in some cases it's even harder to recieve, especially when you don't feel deserving "
a full day of classes ahead of me  i need to focus and get my act together 
"classes over  lately there seems to be too many hours in the day 'til night rolls around  sometimes i'm okay, sometimes not  if only i could turn back the clock "
feeling better day by day  it's not been easy  letting go is a hard process 
"i've got so much clarity now, it's not even funny "
"god <propmale> me the strength to change the things i can, the courage to accept the things i can't and the wisdom to know the difference "
just when you think you're done with something it rears it's ugly head to remind you that you were just fooling yourself 
"my subconscious has betrayed me  i used to wish that i could turn back the clock  now, i just want to move it ahead "
i am not giving up!
"going to church tomorrow wif me mum  after that, bible study wif me friends  i'm a bit nervous about the latter "
so be it 
is in a good place  closure is a beautiful thing  the realization that i was the strong one and didn't give up has done wonders for my self esteem 
just got a cell phone  hit me up with all y'all's digits
