"just watched a judge <propfemale> in which a 19-year-old was in a relationship supposedly with a 67-year-old  disgusting! the old man said they were friends  however, i find it quite interesting that as soon as the judge starting asking about whether they were intimate and the girl said she was his girlfriend, the old man legally withdrew the case from the court so \her reputation\"" wouldn't be damaged  uh huh   sure   """
just called the clemson student phonathon to request them to stop soliciting us for money  i told them that we know where the school is at if we ever want to make a donation  what i really wanted to tell them was that there isn't a <propmale> in hades that my husband is sending clemson additional money (because he already paid them for his degree) since i'm a usc graduate hahaha!
feels slightly misanthropic today

good night <propfemale>!
thinks all of her friends should block off their farmville avatar (if they haven't done so already!) so that fertilizing and chicken feeding goes ever so much quicker since the avatar can't take its sweet time walking!  wink

bp and the government warn that the oil may leak out until august  seriously? august?!? three months from now? that's unacceptable  maybe if bp had come up with a viable emergency plan (that our lovely govt approved of when it was filled with crap that they copied and pasted from an alaskan emergency plan) then our poor environment wouldn't be destroyed forever

"everyone, please continue to pray for my kitties  they make up my heart, which is feeling quite battered and shredded within the last 24 hours  <propfemale> is getting another x-ray tomorrow of his 2 tumors so he can be referred to a specialist  they say he is terminal, but i just can't accept it yet  arial is getting a 2nd x-ray tomorrow too, b c something isn't quite right in her abdomen  i pray i don't lose her as well "
was up til 3 taking care of my kitties and now i'm up again to pick up haus and take him to get his 2nd x-ray and hopefully to a specialist at some point today  i hope they can get the x-ray done and appt made for him  my handsome boy   
"says thank you for your thoughts and prayers for my kitties  an update about them, most life threatening sick is still <propfemale>  he couldn't see the cardiothoracic specialist yesterday (will go monday), so we still have no idea if his 2 tumors are treatable  he is having a hard time breathing  please pray that he isn't suffering and that we can make him better  i don't want to lose him "
"does anyone here in cola have a window air conditioning unit they'd be willing to part with that works well and is reasonably priced? it should probably be at least 5-6000 bpus, but the more the better  i want one to help my <propfemale> with the tumors breath easier in the garage   "
"is trying to not think today  also, i'm annoyed that fv made it where you can't copy and paste gift links anymore for their collections  how stupid  how about zynga focus on making the game use less cpu rather than make the game more annoying difficult for fans to play?"
can't stand when people use my email for stuff without my permission 
"some might think this is silly, but please pray for the little green lizard that got injured in my driveway tonight about 2 hours ago  he was my friend that i always chased around my car and even in my car  i found him with red ants on him  i think he got ran over right behind his back legs and the poor guy is oozing stuff  i put him in a box under a lamp and used some antibiotic stuff (saw that online) "
today is the day that i take serena haus to the specialist  please continue to pray for him and i suppose us as well  poor caesar is sneezing-- i hope he didn't get a respiratory infection along with his uti  i hate leaving him by himself while i'm with his brother across town   
is tired and about to start swearing b c caesar needs a new antibiotic and i can't get it unless i drive 40 <propfemale>  across town to the vet before they close  no closer vet will let me get it from them unless i visit their doctors even though my vet would call it in to them  i wasn't going across town until tonight so i could figure out an easier way for <propfemale> to take his medicine at 10  i'm so sick of vet visits!!!!!!!
wants to bite some heads off  fur is going to fly! i'm cranky and tired and hungry and i want healthy cats!!!!
anyone ever tried those greenie pill pockets for cats?
"dear precision tune of broad river rd, 3 years ago this august, i went to you to get an oil change  you then proceeded to try and scare me trick me out of more money by telling me that my brake pads were dangerously thin and that i shouldn't even think about taking my car to atlanta the next day--the pads wouldn't make it "
"has been working up interest to vacuum for the past two days   yep, not quite there yet "
fv is really ticking me off tonight  my account isn't working and <propmale>'s account keeps screwing up 
"is ticked off at long's pharmacy on farrow road  they've screwed up twice in one day on my cat's aspirin  first, they give me 16 tablets of 2 5mg when my prescription clearly states 30 tablets of 5 mg  then, <propmale> goes to pick it up and they want to charge him more than they tried to charge me this afternoon  when i called wednesday to price shop around, they quoted me 25  now, they want me to pay $37  hell no "
"if my mother sees this, she'll be happy to know that my farmville is still broken "
thinks it is tragic that <propfemale>'s changed the side caesar salad  there isn't even bacon bits on it anymore  anyone who knows me knows that this salad is one of my favorite foods in the world 
farmville got enhanced and i'm baaaaccckkk!!!!!
it is a hot day to be working outside  ************** smile *****
wishes i could wear the same yearly contacts that i wore for probably close to 10 years  i don't know why they started irritating my eyes  i hate weekly or daily disposables--such a waste of money!
is getting ready to head over soon to my parents' house to check on my kitties and other babies   
is moving in 2 weeks!

"correction because i can't type think sometimes! i got \my 76 something textbook (plus shipping if i wanted anything other \than free super saver shipping) for 44 dollars with e playful edited shipping on \half com  score!"
trying to get stuff done  scheduled an ac appt because the man still hasn't tracked the freon leak in the past 2 months  he's been out 2x & said a month ago he'd be back in a week  should've known he'd forget to come back again-- he did that the 1st time & i had to call him 
"can't stand how financial institutions have their customer service representatives in another country  i can't freaking understand them, and you shouldn't mess with people's finances!"
"wow  the person our <propfemale> hired to powerwash our houses gutters is a real piece of work  you can't powerwash a house in less than 10 minutes and then b$%^$ that they were dirty from poorer power washing done in years past  last year, the man took 40 minutes excluding the gutters and he very nicely came back out and redid it when i had chemicals dried on my siding "
why do i always get stuck with everyone who doesn't care about quality service?!?
"got my hair cut today, and i'm a little bummed  it looks the same as it did before i got it cut (after not having it cut for 6 mo > >;; wink  just shorter  i don't think she understood that i wanted an edgier cut  sad "
"am i crazy or did fv change the pisa and fountain favor count? it says 80 and 60, respectively, when i thought it was 100 and 75, respectively   "
"back home from lunch with my sisters, dropping off recycling, and replacing my watch battery for the 2nd time in 2 days  now, i'm washing my new shirt, jeans, and jacket that my 18 mo old niece got some spots on  she didn't mean to mess up aunt sarey's new shirt outfit, but she just really wanted to throw her sippy cup into mama's tomato-based soup at <propfemale> garden  it got in my hair and on my face as well   annoyed "
so instead of cleaning up the kitchen which i haven't done in a couple of nights or actually cooking dinner   i go outside and spend nearly an hour and a half tidying up my front lawn's pinestraw beds and driveway sidewalk because the landscaping people i pay (through the <propfemale>) never do a good enough job  i'm a <propmale> ocd when it comes to trying to keep my yard perfect looking ^ ^;;;;;;;
"can't stand when people type \nom nom \"""""
"is really, really, really upset  i was clicking to delete a plot in fv to move my nursery barn to get a <propfemale> chicken stuck behind it and fv deleted my entire barn  it didn't ask me if i was sure i wanted to delete it at all, though it does that with just a stupid plot!"
"\we can't go on together with suspicious minds    and we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds   \"""""
"is psyched!!! anabella of zynga is fantastic! i e playful lained that i was moving to ny in a week from sc for grad school and didn't have time to recollect all of my pieces due to the nursery barn deleting incident  i told her i really felt like it was a glitch, and i couldn't afford to buy all of my pieces to rebuild my barn  she made a one time exception for me and gave me a nursery barn in my giftbox!  love   love   love "
"i lost my son, <propfemale>, tonight  i'm trying to remember he is in heaven, but i just am so upset as to what dhec is going to do to him  he was in a ton of pain and he bit a vet tech who has been vaccinated against rabies  he has never bitten someone before  please pray that i get him home mostly whole  i can't think he won't be home whole "
"caesar's uti is back, and <propmale> is taking him to the emergency vet today  his \antibiotic ended friday, and i guess it wasn't enough to wipe it out "
is still working on the casket for my son   
is bringing my son home tomorrow afternoon for burial 
trying to not think today because it hurts too much 
"if i was a cat, i would not want to be my cat  i'd run away as fast as my legs would let me "
off to take caesar to the vet-- for the 2nd time today!
"got back from the emergency vet  they are keeping caesar overnight to make sure he can urinate  on the bright side, at least the emergency vet is in the same building as the specialist, so they can just transfer him tomorrow morning without me having to take him for his ultrasound at 10 smile 0 am!"
"well, caesar is having surgery today  they are making my boy a girl pretty much so he can't get blocked again by stones crystals  my poor son "
is trying to figure out how <propmale> and i are going to move up to ny in 2 trips now that caesar needs to remain in cola for some extra time to recover from his surgery   
is pretty darn tired today 
"misses caesar but kind of hopes he stays another day at the surgical vet's place    his poor bum looked all bloody and icky when i saw him earlier! i do believe he is everyone's favorite patient right now though  they were all gushing over how sweet, beautiful, and loving he is  proud he's been behaving well  smile "
okay seriously? i've been waiting 10 minutes to just get a price quote on 5 tires from tire kingdom for <propmale>! who needs to get a manager to give a price quote?!?
"wants to say some e playful letives  am i understanding everyone on fb by interpreting that usc is playing clemson? i thought i only had to deal with that in football  i can't stand the tension rivalry  it isn't good for my marriage, because i can't stand rude comments about usc made by clemson fans  it in turn makes me want to hate on my hubby's <propfemale> mater, because i'm defensive and territorial "
loves <propfemale> but is really annoyed at her for hissing and hating on caesar-- her brother  he can't help he might smell a little different and that he walks funny because of his lampshade harness contraption  sad 
is doing some packing   
will always remember and never forget you hausy  one less week until we see each other again handsome boy!
one week 
lots of stuff to do today-- let's see how much i actually get done -_-;
packing packing packing!!!!!! gaaaah so much to do!!!!!
"thinks the worst thing about spot bot is a tie  it is either that the vacuum hose will leak a bit when sucking up stuff; or, it is the incessant beeping when it is done cleaning  i'll turn you off in a freaking minute!!!"
"is going through english withdrawal    i always wanted my phd in it, but i need a job, too   sad "

"is cursing newhouse out for adding more homework to the tons they've already given us  don't they know some of us are trying to move across the freaking country?!?! i should've started the homework earlier, but i didn't want to forget anything i read! grrr!!!!!!!!!!!!"
is getting a crick in her neck from reading journalism hw so long   
hallelujah! no third game! feel bad for ucla's fans team but really happy for our team and how hard they worked!
my husband must really love me to not ban me from the garage (and be mad)  who knew that a dust collector could suck up a small bottle of rain x in a cardboard box that was 3-4 in away? sad thing is he had just told me to be careful  i turned it off as fast as i could  there blew saving him time  anyone know if rain x can ignite in a dust collector if a piece of wood hits the fan blade and makes a spark?!? *** annoyed 
wants to know why no one in columbia (possibly the state) or even amazon com has the 2010 edition of the ap stylebook  it has been a month people!
who provides electricity in syracuse? is there just one provider?
"thank god the house we're renting already has the power turned on (so we can get a meter reading and transfer it on tuesday to our name)  otherwise, we'd be moving to a place with no power  go me for remembering on a friday evening at 5:45 that i'll need power that weekend-- especially since they are closed on monday!"
has had an insane three days 
sure wants the old version of the <propfemale>'s caesar salad  it was so mean of them to take my beloved salad away from me and turn it into that nasty asiago cheese caesar salad with lemon caesar dressing! the kicker is they went up 20 cents in price for that ickiness as well!
"this is turning into a not so great day  caesar is annoying the hades out of me because i had to lock him up in the bathroom again for urinating where he isn't supposed to  i feel bad that he got stressed when we went to ny, but seriously, shut up please!!! i thought he was getting better since he had his stitches taken out yesterday   "
is trying to motivate myself to stay focused and unpack 
would rather go to the library to pick up a book waiting on her so that she could be absorbed by it rather than finishing unpacking    hmm unpack so we have cooking stuff and can get groceries or read     that's a tough one   
"just took caesar's lampshade off after nearly 3 weeks of it on  i thought for sure he'd start licking his stinky nether regions first, but noooo     he is obsessively licking his upper regions which were kept clean by us using baby wipes "
"thanks for the rain, lord  i appreciate free water any day during the long, hot summer days "
is working hard on solving the case of the missing potatoes 
"is breathing but really wishes she had a break right now from life  i'd love to go to some pretty, quiet, tropical beach and just soak up the rays with a good book    oh and <propmale> of course     annoyed igh:    that'd be heavenly "
"thinks caesar looks naked without his harness and lampshade on  i'm going to miss saying \whattup lampshade??\"" to him      sad """
wishes she had some strawberry bushels and a needler's thing for the country collection 
<propmale> is holding my computer hostage because my wrist hurts  he's harvesting my c surprise p strawberries but i won't be able to plant anything else to finish the c surprise p up like i was planning   sad 
"showering, baby shower errands, and then furniture shopping with big g!  wink "
please pray for my <propfemale> arial  i stopped by my parents' house this evening and noticed that her neck throat was swollen and hard feeling  she is at the emergency vet right now  they are doing a lot of tests xrays because they don't know what is wrong with her  4 weeks ago tonight i put my <propfemale> <propfemale> asleep in the same room they put arial and me in  i can't lose another baby or have another one seriously sick  kiss *(
is praying arial's swelling goes down with her antibiotic; otherwise we need to do an ultrasound of her throat head at the end of the week  she is just so weak and pitiful looking  kiss ( i'm keeping her in the hall bathroom because i don't want her to e playful end energy trying to walk around a new environment 
"is anxious  i can't tell if my <propfemale>'s swelling is the same or getting worse  i just know she looks like she feels so bad, especially with her watery, half-closed eyes and dripping nose that is bone dry on the exterior  i don't want to jump the gun by taking her to the vet and not giving her antibiotic time to work, but i also don't want something else to be going on and give that something else time to get worse    "
is sitting on the couch with arial beside me  she went to the er last night to get an appetite stimulant and some fluids  her appetite hasn't really cranked back up  <propmale> and i love feeling like mean parents by squirting water and blended <propfemale> food into her mouth with syringes   annoyed 
yay for rain on watering day! hopefully it will be enough!
just got home from a long but brisk walk with the hubs  i sure wish the pool was still open!
"eating dinner and then taking arial to the er vet for the third time this week  apparently, she should be eating on her own now since she's been on an appetite stimulant the past 48 hours   "
"my <propfemale>, arial, is critical  please pray for her and that <propmale> and i will make the best decisions regarding her care  she's getting a blood transfusion right now  her white blood cell count has skyrocketed since saturday when her blood work was normal  i want her feeling well and happy and in my lap for as long as god will allow me to keep her   "
"i lost the sweetest, sassiest, ruler of them all <propfemale> tonight  i love you <propfemale> and miss you already "
"you know, most of my family didn't want to see arial yesterday before i put her to sleep  i didn't want to have to do that-- to tell someone to kill my little girl  however, that is what makes me her mama and not anyone else  i was there for her no matter the pain it cost me  that's what a mama does    she sacrifices for her child  i just never e playful ected to have 2 babies die in my arms in under 5 weeks "
was hoping to get arial's casket built tonight so i could start staining it but <propmale> started feeling really sick outside working on it   sad 
"is working on my little girl's (arial, see profile pic) coffin  i'm still in the sanding stage-- i want it to be as smooth as possible before staining it a rosewood color "
<propmale> and i were up to four am and then he got back up at 9 to work on arial's coffin trying to get it done so we could have her service today  i think it will end up being tomorrow considering how many stains of coat and polycrilic i need to apply and how long you must wait in between coats  sad  
loves storms but they are messing up everything right now 
is hoping to get one more clear coat on the casket a bit after midnight before hitting the sack   
"is thankful that god provided us with a beautiful evening and kept the severe thunderstorms at bay so that <propmale>, dad, and i could bury my sweet girl  i've been worried about that all week "
"is having one of those days where there is a lot of house stuff that i'd like to do, but i just can't seem to decide and focus on what to actually get started doing   "
"thinks <propfemale> <propmale> made a pretty bride! her dress hair veil really looked beautiful, classy and elegant!"
"just tried on my wedding dress again-- tomorrow will have been 21 months! it still fits, but i honestly thought it might be a <propmale> looser  however, i guess you don't really lose weight in the rib cage area lol! man, my seamstress made it tight up top!!"
wants the beef stew in the crock pot  badly  i've only eaten a 6 pack of crackers today!!
