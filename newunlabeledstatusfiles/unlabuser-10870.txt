"â€œi've heard that it's possible to grow up - i've just never met anyone who's actually done it  without parents to defy, we break the rules we make for ourselves  we throw tantrums when things don't go our way, we whisper secrets with our best friends in the dark, we look for comfort where we can find it, and we hope - against all logic, against all e playful erience  like children, we never give up hope   â€�"
