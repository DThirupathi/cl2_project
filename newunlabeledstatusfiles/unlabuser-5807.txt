i ran into 2 people i never ever thought id see again
for 24 hours you can ask me one question (only in my inbox) i will answer it no matter what you have my full honesty  i dare you to put this in your status and see what people ask you
"43 â€œyou have heard that it was said, â€˜you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy â€™ 44 but i say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust "
"46 for if you love those who love you, what reward have you? do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 and if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? do not even the tax collectors do so? 48 therefore you shall be perfect, just as your father in heaven is perfect \(<propfirst> 43-4 smile \\isnt this just beautiful?"
person a: meow    peron b: what? a: meow meow meow b: what the heck?!?!?! a: meow!!!!!!!!!!!!!     rada b: (runs away as fast as possible)
