gettin' ready for my interview  wish me luck!!
i've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks i've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
"too vague, too vague  you can try to resolve the past right now, but i swear i'll be the one to let the world know what you've done watch your back,  you'll lose yourself! this is a battleground! when will they know, your life's a lie "
"get up, get out,\who's gonna break our fall,\when we don't back down, they're gonna seem so small,\we keep em running for the door,"

got a new haircut yesterday the lady had a very liberal view of how short i wanted it     oh well its cute anyway lol
you can scream out loud but your panic falls on deaf ears this is where you brought yourself and this is what you've always feared there's a faceless crowd with no sympathy so you can scream out loud but there's no one listening
the guilt's no good and it only shames us more and the truth that we all try to hide its oh so clear when it not our lies we dont face the blame
"\what you do? try to walk and chew gum at the same time\"""""
facebook: crack of the 21st century

"conscience is a faint, unpleasant sound, you've worried enough, but here's your <propmale> so take it dammit i hope you take it\a heart attack is sleeping in your chest, waiting until the timing's best\so make a move, while you're still breathing say so long to innocence\from underneath the evidence\you taste like heaven, but god knows you're built for sin"

"have faith in me cause there are things that i've seen i don't believe\so cling to what you know and never let go you should know things           \aren't always what they seem\i said i'd never let you go, and i never did\i said i'd never let you fall and i always meant it\if you didn't have this <propmale> then i never did\you'll always find me right there, again"
" love  you're a <propfemale> how i found you i still don't know but now i've got you and i'll never let you go if your heart's a pocket looking for some change\my heart makes lots of sense\just stay quiet, breathe deep, breathe out, breathe slow \don't say a word let our eyes speak\and they will tell you  love "
"swirling shades of blue slow dancing in your eyes the sun kisses the earth\and i hush my urge to cry 'cause i hear the whispered words in your masterpiece beautiful you speak the unspeakable through i love you too"
