"i pose this question to anyone that can answer is: what is a \monster\"" ?"""
"ah, it's beautiful this world of ours the only ugly thing that my eyes can see are human beings, they are so stupid and ignorent things they all deserve nothing more then death "
"i see everything everyone will ever do it makes life boring but i guess it means i know how to find my \true love\"" i just have to love for the person that i cant predict"""
i have found the answer to a quetion no one has been able to answer!!!

"\life isn't worth living if your not having fun!\"" so smoke that last cig and shut up!  laugh """
there are some ppl in this world that shouldnt be aloud to live and one day i will make it so they dont! thats a promise   
"the adults need to start acting their age and show their kids how to make right decisions in life, kids ya'll need to learn that love is not wat most of u think it is, and last but not least the hate and angry needs to stop because its not help create anything but more hate and angry    we are all to blame i guess but i dont want to see this world slip thro the cracks     "
"what has happened to this world? when did it become so perverse? and was is it that no generation acts the age its suppossed to? all i see is adults acting like children, kids acting like they want to find true love, and a whole lot of hate amoung the rest or the population "
this world is going numb where is all the happiness that was has so long ago and why is it that my generation missed out on it? its just not fair   
"everyone in this world of ours have many different ways of thinking, but we all have the ability to change when we realise our mistakes, just because we do something wrong doesn't mean we forfeit the future   "
everytime i place trust in someone they turn their back on me   sometime i wish i was evil enough to stab them in that back but im not and it seems that i will never get anything outa this life other then pain    but im still gonna try    
"my life is coming down around me  i e playful ected it to but not so soon, oh well im gonna have fun with it at least    "
this world of ours is going down hill fast and it seems as though noone else can see it   
why is it that when ever u point out wat kinda of person someone is they always freak out? i mean really if u dont like who u are then change!
ignorance and stupidity breed hate and distrust     and this world of ours is full of all four of these thing    its sad because its as if n surprise ne even cares    
this life isn't worth it after all    
"i always say \i would die for my friends\"" and its true but em your the girl that i would come back just to see again  em i love you more then all the stars in the clear night sky and i always will """
im not really using this life for anything good will someone take it from me?
its time i start thinking about me and what i want so here we go lets see if this will be fun 
i wont be on facebook for awhile so i'll see ya around
this world is rotting to the core and the only way to find the happiness that we all want is to dig through the filth but after awhile we become covered by it and begin to slip into a numbing bliss thinking its happiness   
these are the three things i live my life by 1: that a man is only as good as his word and that he should fallow through  2: that it is a man obligation to protect and take care of women they may not need use men to do this but its still our duty to continue to try  3: that when you make a mistake to take ur punishment with your head held high and not try and escape you responsabilities 
"what is \love\"" to you? please e playful lain it because it seems to me that there is no longer any of what i believe to be love left in this broken world   """

"how many chances do we have to be happy in this life, are some of those chances illusions?"
in life we all have many chances to be happy but an untold number of these chances are nothing more then delusionary dreams

my heart is in pain because i'm not sure how to help and that i know my hopes will never come true   
"heading to the padded room soon, i hope \happy jackets\"" come in the color black that way it'll match the color of the darkness i feel closing in around me   """
i have three choices i can make and as far as i can tell they will all end badly for me    i wish i had a three sided coin to flip it would help alot   
"when a person's life draws to a close and they feel death's icy grip start taking hold do they remember all the things they regret? this question scares me because if people only remeber their regret then what will death bring me, a man without regret, only empty thought in which i will feel nothing but death as it creeps over me?"
meh    life continues as always 
don't touch my happy jacket!!! it's mine!!!
"why is it i have nightmares over things i can't change, is it not enough that i always go outa my way to help everyone else but now i can't even escape my inability to help in my dreams   "

"life is aways worth living, we just need to search our hearts to find out why it is "
