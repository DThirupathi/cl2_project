"day seven: myo quiz - done! *phew* ohmygoodness, i think i overstudied the wrong stuff and forgot the easy  (especially the things that weren't even on there!) ah well  in any event, a good initiation into the quizzing world of myology  now: a general review of the shoulder bones (clavicle, scapula, and humerus), and a skimming of a&p before early bedtime  yay!  laugh "
"day nine: myology quiz grades back in, and i'm kicking my own rear for making such a stupid mistake (aside from the rectus femoris vs  biceps femoris question)  completely spaced out on something i knew, and can't even e playful lain how or why i might have chosen the answer i did  argh!! so frustrated by stuff like that    anyhow, overall i guess i can't -really- complain    got a 93     laugh "
"   really?!     *grumble* unhappy panda needs to punch things  repeatedly  way too tired and ine playful licably annoyed to even focus on anything remotely productive  thinking about a workout before bed, but afraid that'll mess up my sleep  ideas?"
"happy friday! wishing i could join the tgif celebrations, but have to go in tomorrow for pathology and an anatomy & phys quiz  (ugh   8 smile 0 - 4 smile 0 on a saturday    definitely a test of willpower!     or constitution fortitude   ) in any case, there's way too much to do to be this tired   sad "
day ten: getting a good breakfast really -does- help concentration and general outlook on the day  and now: study! study! study! before early bedtime  5 am is gonna get here awfully fast   sad 
"woke up 5 minutes (exactly) before the alarm  hoping i passed my will or fortitude save (whichever it is the school is testing    )  bleary, but awake! bring on the an & phys    oh yeah    i got this  *lol* why is the computer desk so comfy?  playful "

"day twelve: anatomy & phys quiz 2 scores back - another 100! rocked that chemistry unit's socks clear off, i tell ya!  laugh  now we're working on cellular structure, and today's focus was dna & rna  definitely gonna put to use a slinky an awesome mr  <propfirst> greis gave me for yule   laugh  (i think i can reasonably pass it off as a study aid for this part   ) tomorrow - myology  tonight: sleep!"
"day thirteen:     can't i have a nap, pleeeease?  sad  even my vitamin waters aren't enough to keep me awake alert   annoyed  not rightly sure why i'm so darned tired, but here's hoping i can gear up for some focus in myology today "

there must be sone kinda way outta here   
"day     seventeen: anatomy & phys quiz on cellular structure: done! a little tricksy on the wording  ok, -very- tricksy in some spots, but i hear that's how it is when you take the boards, so    all for the best, right? i think the majority of the class was too focused on the poor <propfemale> crying outside to really pay attention to the new tissue material "
day nineteen: a&p quiz - 97! *phew* gotta cram like crazy for the myo quiz tomorrow  flashcards    i still need to make flashcards!
"day twenty: myo quiz - ow  such a headache, but very glad i was so thorough and used every minute possible  i -think- it's around a 90, but we'll see  at least now i know what to focus on for the bigger unit 1&2 test tue  now, to study some a&p (what we learned so far, that is) before finishing the unit tomorrow and quizzing sat  oh, and toss in some pathology studying for -that- quiz on sat, too     yay weekend?  annoyed "
"day twenty-one: learned the a&p quiz tomorrow is open-notes and let forth a grand huzzah!    ok, well, no real huzzah-ing to be heard, but i definitely -thought- it    still gotta type 'em up in a nice, concise, coherent format, though, and study for pathology quiz "
was shown the awesomeness of sc2 + bejewelled      soooo cooool!! lol
"tomorrow is not gonna be pretty    but it is coming on pretty soon  to bed, with hopes of remembering stuff during tomorrow's quizzes "
"day off!     was very much awake around 9a, but forced myself to sleep a couple more hours  now what? lol oh, that's right! study!"
"hm    eat dinner or study for myo?     i think maybe both, somehow?"
"day twenty-five: keeping the myology average just above 90, which is nice  hoping for better stuff in the next unit (forearm & hand), but we'll see    rather liking the anatomy unit on skeletal structures so far - esp being able to see touch actual bones  that's pretty darn neat!  laugh "
"day twenty-six: doc's appt  went quick 'n easy - no needles, out early enough for some breakfast before class (spinach & broccoli omelette and some corned beef hash ftw!)  got to poke at some forearm bones in myo - must find some more to play with      i mean    study )"
"day twenty-eight: wow, these long, two-day weekends really throw me off! (lol) and yet they never seem long enough    ah well   smile  mr  beeks isn't feeling too well these last few days, hoping he's gonna pull out of it soon!"

"day forty-nine: (sort of) first call-in-sick day   sad  migraine all night (idk if it's a plural or just one really long one in tidal pattern  they're all over the same area this week,so it's kinda hard to distinguish one from another ) took 2 imitrex, and an hour or so after the 2nd, was finally able to lay down w o feeling like the world was crashing into another planet  then my alarm went off "
"live it,\love it,\lube it! \\ wink  i was in my happy place tonight  just sayin'   laugh "

day sixty-one: full day of a&p and path! found out a few things: 1) the path quiz i was stressing over b c i didn't recall discussing a fair amount of the info was causing stress for a reason: i had next week's quiz (lol! but was able to ace it *phew! wink  2) i need to make more fruit pizza (though maybe keep the bananas off til just before serving    3) food (especially rumballs!) makes saturday classes awesome!  laugh 
"a lil sad i missed out on the super-full <propfemale>, but feeling amazingly better after about 15 hours of sleep   "
"day sixty-two: was called into the director's office *dramatic pause with some equally-dramatic music* to discuss what they can help me with in regards to making the headaches go away! (awww!!  laugh ) first order of business: increase notes & test fonts from 36 to 55+ (yes, that -is- ginormous text, but it is <propfemale> much easier to read!) second: get  more  massages  (lol; how could i possibly say \no\"" to that?) so yay!  smile """
