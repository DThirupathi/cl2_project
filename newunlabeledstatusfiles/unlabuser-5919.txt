headed to the nav rally at fort rucker and wishing i went for a run this morning instead of sleeping in   the peachtree 10k is only days away!
finished the peachtree 10k at 40:41!  not the greatest but i'm plenty happy with it       and now it's time to train rangers     again (i feel like the dunkin donuts guy from those 80's commercials) 
running 10 <propmale> tomorrow with a goal of 62 minutes   your prayers are welcome and appreciated 
"a good week   i fixed an old washing machine with a screwdriver, some web surfing, and a few lucky guesses   so if i leave the army there may be a future for me at maytag   anyhow, i guess i'll reward myself by seeing gi <propfirst> tonight "
