trips me out how much the <propfemale> illuminates things sometimes   
another beautiful missile launch  that never gets old for me 
arguing with myself about whether or not i can afford the apartment i've got my eye on  hmmm   
"part of me is considering taking up running  then at least when people ask me how i stay so thin, i have something to say other than \lol nothing \"""""
so i think it's finally time for new hubcaps 
looking at fabric to improve upon my <propfemale> kid tutu 
didn't get all my errands finished because i lost my list but i got the more important ones taken care of 
stuck somewhere between the 3rd and 4th step  be out of the woods soon though i think 
working 6p to 4a tonight  bring it 
"i am a handful - unfortunately most women won't re-post this  i'm strong willed, independent, a bit outspoken, and i tell it like it is  i make mistakes, i am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle but i love and give with all my heart  if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best  if you are a handful, re-post! i dare you "
ot tonight  bring the ibuprofen and lets do this!
hanging in there  6 hours to go   annoyed 
tonight was long but it never ceases to amaze me how good a night can turn out even though your in a shitty zone and you'll be there for 10hrs and with the right mix of people in your zone it really can make the time fly by  much love to ya if you passed through my zone tonight and much love to my ot verifiers  we made it 
ciao bitches  oh and seriously haters gonna hate   cause i know you were mad about that potato chip for another reason   laugh

if i can hear your music from 3 seats away  your music is too loud  no one else wants to listen to your shitty rap music   hope you go deaf in the next 5 years 
today is the first time in awhile that a friday is actually my friday 
cleaning my house like a crazy lady  landlord is supposed to be here at 3 for the inspection and i has coffee with my briar at 4 
blasting my music for a change  no more of the morons next door doing it and then idiots on my damn bus doing it  it's my turn damn it 
hate seeing my babies so upset  really stresses me out  :[
for the record  this is probably the best land lord i have ever had  not saying much since i've only rented two places  but seriously 
shamrock  love  come one come all 
so this weekend has been pretty great  back to work wednesday  trying to make this last as long as possible   annoyed 
tired and cold  back is killing me randomly too  oh well back to work tonight finally 
"oh work  i did not miss you  however i did miss the hilarious, gorgeous, amazing ladies i work with  see you all tonight   love "
my bed has become a nest of blankets and i having a hard time leaving it 
tylenol and sleepy time   love 
i'm getting waaaay too good at waking up 10 minutes before my alarm goes off 
"so tonight is boxing night  and ladies you know what that means  the floor is gonna reek of testosterone, <propmale> and maybe even a little bit of failure  the eye <propfemale> will be on parade  so single ladies, work it  and taken ladies, remind your men how lucky they are to have you on their arm  bust out your push up bras and your best perfume  tonight lets shake up this floor!"
work was fun tonight   love  one of those rare occasions 
superbowl when i wake up  hell yes

about to watch moulin rouge with my sisters  honestly our favorite musical to sing along to 
meh  still awake  watching dr  who reruns 
woke up to my sisters poised over me with pillows  then they started beating me with them  god i miss them   annoyed

"running around like crazy trying to get my laundry done before work  finally have a minute to sit, eat and relax  *sigh*"
laundry and bed  sounds like a plan 
errands in sm today  specifically at the mall  text me if you wanna meet up 
watching a movie before bed  slightly dismayed by my night  beginning to wonder if love ever lasts anymore 
gram and gramps are gonna feed me foods now  see you all at work   love

wtf my ipod has zero battery  gonna be a long quiet trip to and from work 
i really need to quit this farmville nonsense  i have like 50+ requests and my crops keep dying   annoyed  had a good run with it though 
came home to moonlit clouds and wind blown drizzle  couldn't help but stop and admire nature for a moment 
love how it's just fucking pouring  i was so confused when i woke up and my house was still very dark  but hey i guess it makes for easier day sleeping 
trying to import my contacts from facebook to skype but it keeps saying something about the server or whatever and i got paid today but it looks like i got shorted 100$ 
well my walk way is flooded and i almost had to dogpaddle to my car  getting out of my car i was hurrying to get inside and slipped  totally landed on my ass 
well today sucked  eventually you do stupid shit stupid shit happens and you laugh it off  i'm pretty much past the laughing part  not funny anymore 
woke up to thunder and lightning   which by the way scared the hell out of me 
soooo busy tonight  tgif though 
disneyland!
my face is sore from all that smiling yesterday    smile 
trying to get all my neglected chores done  laundry check  garbage check  need to go grocery shopping this week and clean the kitchen 
why does today feel so cold? jeebus  i'm literally a blanket burrito sitting at my computer 
i'm aware my current living situation is odd  but do i need constant commentary about it? no  it's my business so kindly fuck off and worry about your own lives
didn't sleep very well but that's my own fault i suppose 
slowly waking up  it really helps me sleep when the weather is like this 
my bus is all toasty warm    love 
on my way home  can't believe my week is almost over 
grocery shopping accomplished  watching the bag boys fight over who got to help me out to my car  extremely flattering  after telling them i didn't need help and walking out to my car alone  i turn around and one had followed me to my car anyway  which was creepy 
trying to figure out what i'm gonna do with myself this weekend    i wanna see a movie i think but i don't wanna go by myself    annoyed 
watching movies and cleaning house tonight i think 
finally watched tangled  so adorable   love

pouring rain  suitable i suppose 
nightmares need to go away now  plzkthnx
