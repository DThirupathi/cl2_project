"it is clear that the authors of <propmale> and <propfirst> both read the greek translation of <propmale> 7:14 and consequently thought that jesus should be born of a virgin   however, the hebrew text uses the word â€œalmaâ€� which simply means â€œyoung womanâ€�   it does not imply virginity in any way   this is why <propfirst> and <propfirst> donâ€™t seem to be aware of maryâ€™s virginity, and do not sync up with <propmale> and <propfirst> on that point "
