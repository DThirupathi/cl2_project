"goddammit  why did he have to go? seriously, after so long spent searching    to know him for only 3 months  why the hell couldn't he have gotten better? why couldn't a certain asshole sitting in belmont correctional have died instead? life is a <propmale> bitch and i am sick of it  sick of the pain and heartache and all the shit  sick of crying  rip daddy "
"i feel so lost  i just want my daddy back  i just want this to all have been a bad dream and daddy to be alive and healthy   no cancer, no pneumonia  i just want life to be ok and not hurt so bad  i just want a huge hug from my dad  rip daddy (2 12 69-10 24 10)  i  love  you "

just wants to walk without any assistance and get around with no pain  stupid knee injury 
where was god in the horrors of my past? where was he in the pain? where is he in the scars? where is god when i cry myself to sleep? where is he when i just want to throw in the towel and quit? where is god in the middle of the nightmare? where is he? because it sure isn't here 
i am a poet writing of my pain  i am a person living in shame  i am your daughter hiding her depression  i am your sister making a good impression  i am your friend pretending i'm fine  i am a wisher wishing this wasn't mine  i am a girl thinking about suicide  i am a teenager pushing her tears aside  i am the girl next to you asking you to care  i am your best friend hoping you'll be there 
i guess i have no choice but to thank god for the miracle that just occured  the department of job and family services who usually take forever to do things approved my medicaid after just 2 days! i get to see the surgeon tomorrow after all!
"good news: i don't need surgery, i will be completely off crutches in 5 days, i got a new smaller brace, i'm walking!  laugh  bad news: i need 6 weeks of intensive physical therapy   sad "
walked a little too much i guess because my knee is definitely a bit sore  maybe i should go a bit slower  3 days until my crutches go goodbye forever 
today is twloha day  it is also a day of celebration for me  today is day 31 in my battle to break free from self harm  1 month free on twloha day  totally unplanned   totally awesome 
walked across town

some days are a lot harder than others  grief is a curious thing 
"physical therapy went good today  i now have a set of six exercises to do twice a day 15x each    and they are all painful  sad   however, i was told that i have been healing well and can slowly (very short distances)  start walking without my brace  smile "
