my sagittarius  horoscope for today   you like to give people advice and help them find direction in their lives - sometimes when they haven't even asked  but now it's your turn to feel a little lost  you may need to get away from it all to get some perspective on your life  what about taking a trip to some faraway land? today is a good day to make your vacation plans
