"why we fight ms\\having multiple sclerosis means that you may not be able to walk when you wake up  or that you may suddenly have impaired vision  or that your memory will fail you for no apparent reason  the symptoms of ms are different, and devastating, for everyone - the only certainty is that it will affect yet another person every hour of every day "
"why i walk\\i've registered for walk ms because i want to do something for the people who have been diagnosed - and because i want to do everything to prevent more people from learning what it means to live with this disease  today, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis, and with a diagnosis occurring most frequently between the ages of 20 and 50, many individuals face a lifetime filled with unpredictability "
"why you should sponsor me\the national ms society will use funds collected from walk ms to not only support research for a cure tomorrow, but also to provide programs which address the needs of people living with ms today  because we choose to walk for those who sometimes can't, because we choose to donate to walk ms, we are getting closer to the hour when no one will have to hear the words, \you have ms \"""""
