"well court went okay, didn't get enough time to get everything accomplished with <propmale>, however we did get custody of <propfemale> "
"i am only one person doing the job of 18, how am i not commited yet i don't know"
good grief i never knew having two teenage girls in our house was such hard work   i need some kind of vacation away from home 
it's finally payday   too bad it won't last!
"sometimes it just helps when you can talk through your problems, then life is a lot more pleasant!"

"i got an envelope from ups today with money orders in them today from someone i didn't know    i thought that i was sent a money angel for being good to others and i could get my kids some christmas gifts, but when i went to cash them they told me they had to confiscate them because they were counterfeit    what is this world coming to   why would somebody do such a thing?"
"no where near ready for christmas, bah hum bug! so many presents left to get, but hey at least the tree is up and decorated "
"thought that i would never make it out of the house this morning   i had a big presentation to give and my heart just about beat out of my chest, dang anxiety is hell sometimes - i got through it, and it turned out pretty good    smile "
"starting to get more serious on the wedding planning   only 4 months left to go, i'm going to turn into one of those bridezillas before you know it "

enjoying some quiet time   because i don't get it very often!
"i'm so getting ready for christmas   it's almost here   gotta get the house cleaned and the food prepped today, so we are good to go "
wishing all my family & friends the best of christmas wishes   i hope that all of you are blessed with the gift of love and prosperity   let's not forget to celebrate the best gift of all and wish a happy birthday to jesus!
