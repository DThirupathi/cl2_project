happy new year stef and moe! happy new year to the east coast!!!!!
i will get a picture on here at some point     i don't think that silhouette is quite right     but that one hair on the top of the head pretty accurate!
is pretty accurate    or maybe-that one hair on top of the head's pretty accurate    
thank the lord grampa is showing improvement      continue with the prayers  pray that god will give each of us the strength we need to help each other cope with the realization that even as christians god never promised us that life would be easy 
"salmon run!!! yeah! <propmale> and i went down to the river at lunch and they were there, lookin' forward to some good fishin' in the next couple days "
"grrrrr    not any salmon yet       saw plenty of them, just convincing them that my lure is a threat to their fish-hood has not worked out yet  once they're in the river they no longer feed, so you gotta accidently hook them in the mouth, or get them to attack your lure, too bad any snag not hooked in the mouth is illegal      ben  <propfirst> and i will be going out very soon  wish us luck today!"
"and: i gird myself today with the power of god: god's strength to comfort me, god's might to uphold me, god's wisdom to guide me, god's eye to look before me, god's ear to hear me, god's hand to lead me, god's way    to lie before me, god's shield to protect me    i arise today through the power of the <propfemale>, through faith in the threeness, through trust in the maker of earth, and the maker of heaven "
"i thought this was good, from st  <propfirst>'s breastplate: i gird myself today with the might of heaven: the rays of the sun, the beams of the <propfemale>, the <propfemale> of fire, the speed of wind, the depth of the sea, the stability of the earth, the hardness of rock "
"<propmale> announced monday morning that he and <propfemale> are going to have a baby! being entrusted with a child is one of the greatest blessings god can give, showing that god trusts us enough to raise one of his little ones  i still remember how excited i was when god blessed me with my first child  and i hope everyone remembers that each one of our children is the embodiment of the love we share ed with our spouses "
"yay!!!! caught another salmon   got to fight with this one for a while  it was 36\ long and 16 lbs (same as the last big one)   so we may have smoked salmon at <propfemale>'s wedding """
"there was snow in the air today      frost i can handle, but snow?"
"wel   we almost got that hood ornament <propmale> wanted after we left his house today-a nice 10 point <propmale> ran in front of us and with a burst of speed dodged harms way  it was close, too close"
"you all are not going to believe this, but tonight after i picked <propmale> up from college i was being passed by a black suv and as soon as he got passed me, while he was still in the passing <propfirst>, a deer ran between the suv and my car, this one was a doe, and i am thankful god made her swift because i thought for sure i was going to hit her   it was closer than the <propmale> last night!"
jonathan-sandra needs to join <propfemale>'s army on castle age   
i love the snow    but wish it stayed off the roads!!!
christmas is not fun when you can't taste all the food because of a miserable cold!!!!! i have been cheated!
"why weren't we taught as kids teens what to do when we don't have enough money to pay bills? i don't recall my parents ever having that problem!!!!! it's frustrating   and those collectors on the other end don't seem to understand either   they always think you are holding back your money to buy booze or a prostitute, or some weed or something    grrr"
"-see how much more damage you can do by simply assisting? so please assist people-you don't have to join the battle sequence,  just assisting helps a lot! you received 28260 gold and 1 e playful erience points for your help in summoning the ballista you were the last person required to summon the ballista  the ballista has now launched and inflicted 1500 damage to the deathrune siege!"
happy birthday don   hope you have a great day 
"now just look at this-one assist, using one stamina-and look at the damage it released    you received 61588 gold  and 1 e playful erience points for your help in summoning the <propfemale>  soldiersyou were the last person required to summon the <propfemale>  soldiers  the <propfemale> soldiers has now launched and inflicted 6600000 damage to <propfemale>,  the earth elemental!"
"just got back to wisconsin   went to illinois for my granddaughter's first birthday, was a very nice weekend down there "
something we don't think about every day-without light there is only darkness-total darkness is the natural state of things 
happy anniversary <propfemale> and <propmale>!!!!
"well folks, just got the news this morning    i am no longer employed by impact direct  lovely thing to inspire your day-now i only have a part time job cleaning toilets  i guess life just never gets better then that best moment you just had- so enjoy the good times no matter how scarce and far between "
"still flustered   so, what would you think about a guy who's right around 30 and never had a full time job, and lives off his girlfriend (one of the department heads)  i mean, they laid me off and then hired him to do my job    probably because he would work the least amount he had to and they could pay him less  oh the frustration!!! maybe it's a good thing that he finally has a job   argh!"
"the slings and arrows of misfortune and despair strike us each day, but we must push on, get past the wounds and overcome the enemy, to battle another day  each battle we face strengthens us and helps us maintain our course until we attain victory over our most crucial foe, death, and once we have reached our eternal home we can finally reap the rewards of our battles "
i think we are being over-run with <propmale>s on castle age isf cc-so i am changing my ca name from <propmale> to <propmale>s
if we could but look at our mortal lives from an eternal view point we would find that the physical things that mean so much to us now no longer seem relevant   
to all you mothers out there: happy mother's day
happy mother's day to all you wonderful mothers out there

truth is only relevant to what you have been taught
