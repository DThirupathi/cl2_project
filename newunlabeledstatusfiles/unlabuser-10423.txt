"5 people and 5 statements  is one of them about you?\1 you've called me by my name less than 10 times in the 4 years i've known you \2 you used to be like my brother but then we grew apart \3 you're the craziest, most psycho, understanding, kind, coolest girl i ever knew \4 we never talked until you were gone but now i wish we did \5 you're awesome, you're cute, ut sometimes i want to punch you in the face! luv u"
"good artists take but great artist steal!~ look it up\\      ?\â€¢_â€¢"
i've got no clouds but the <propfemale> just keeps changing colors!!! it's supposed to be black!
i'd like to say that sleep is my peaceful happy place but since i don't dream much it's just another black night  then i wake up and count down to the darkness again because in the day i have nothing of my own desires to be done for my sake as i am always in the service of those i find more deserving of my time and effort  what is selflessness if not a selfish need to have others depend on you?
daddy's little girl knows how to party!!  love 
slept for one hour and cried for 3  kinda glad i have school today 
without wings butterflies are just worms   
beyond happy but i don't know why  i couldn't be more excited but i honestly don't have a clue why!  laugh

"once it's started it cannot end! you can run, but i'll find you again   love "
those specks of stardust in the sky are the shattered stars from my dreams    
merci pour <propfemale> venin!
42-42-564 write on any mirror or window to knock on death's door 
"you can't be upset when they stop asking, if you could never say yes   "
is it for my safety or your benefit that repairs are done? it's harder to get new than fix a broken one    
sooooo freakin tired!!!
"look alive, sunshine   "
should i be shocked now by the last thing you said?
why do you taunt me with silence?
   these times when your heart beats so hard it's all you hear    
twist it all you want but in the end it'll still be what it was to start with   just a little torn but still the same
the enemy of my love is my friend?
it's cold and wet outside and it rocks
in the light of the night your brightest truths are hidden    it's better than dark days and dark secrets
how is that even possible?!?!?
why do you always just happen to be in my dreams? it's getting annoying because i keep wishing those dreams were real   
well he looks at me with those innocent eyes and says it looks like your wearing some kind of disguise  cause your hair is messed up and your shoes are untied and i hope that that you got that shirt at half price! why can't you pretend to be nice?

when i want to be leftalone your the only person that i want near me    too bad you don't care
at least some good news came from this day
if you don't trust me then don't ask me questions  if you don't like how i look then close your eyes  if you don't like who i am forget you ever knew me   
these words were never easier for me to say or her to second guess  without you i'll be miserable at best   
this is the definition of weird!!!
solitary in the masses   
i see you all the time and i never say it but you are really freakin cute  love  jus sayin  smile 
i feel as though i'm going to hate tomorrow   
violence is the key to victory!
life  smile 
i feel aweful!! why do i have to be sick on the weekend!
earlier i was feeling better but now i feel worse!!! i feel like i just got hit by a train underwater! ugh!!
i love your little act! but at intermission you'll be back again to sate yourself till act ii  you're not fickle just confused  i pity you  you brought the curtain down on your self   smile 
"i love the little lies you tell yourself when you see me  just accept it  you can't stop thinking about it!\\xoxo \you know you love me"
"good morning-->bad day-->great night\my friends make everything better smile \\xoxo"

they're irrelevant things that are obviously unimportant  a show is a show no mater how its seen 
it's kinda like i'm on an island   
"do you seriously not get it? put the anger and the unreasonable grudge aside and actually think about it! now, do you get it?\\xoxo"
this music makes my conscious life seem more like a lucid dream   smile 
"hey you! yeah you with the hair, you should totally txt me  smile "

i really want to talk to you   but you just dont get why i like talking to you   
"in my dreams  smile \\xoxo"
some times it's so hard to talk someone you really like    
if i told you how i really feel about you would you accept it? or would you just laugh at me?
"some situations are so hilariously wrong that it's insane but you just have to let some things go    \\xoxo"
"reading to much into things  smile \\xoxo"
everyone has that person they can always turn to and talk to about anything    i'm not everyone
"the simplest words make me happy  smile \\xoxo"
i hate mornings!!!!!! ugh!!!!
i'm loud and ridiculous in public but one on one i'm actually pretty shy and quiet  just thought you need to know    
it's slightly moist outside today  smile 
we all become important when we realise or goal should be to figure out or role in the context of the whole 
"just got back home  had an amazing day  hard to believe that a day this great can even exist!! \\xoxo"
not sad or even mad  i e playful ected it and actually i feel completely unaffected  life   
never before have i felt so much hatred toward school!!!
workin on boley's term paper    i know so much stuff that i never needed to know
computer crashed twice when i tried to open the essay i already did and it did a freaking memory dump!!! ugh!! i really don't feel like typing another 2000 words as opposed to deleting the extra 3000 i had 
taking a break from research and writing 
"i would like my facebook friends to comment on this status, sharing how you met me  but i want you to lie  that's right, just make it up  after you comment, copy this to your status, so i can do the same  i bet half won't read the instructions right"
"background music, nails trimmed, weave adjusted  time for some hard core partying!!"
"if you can't live without me, why aren't you dead?"
not so paradisiacal {} paradise
curse the letter q and its unuseableness!!!
"it's the end of the world as we know it, and u feel fine!!  smile "
"if you think you can do better than this, let's not drag this on  consider me gone   "
"today was fun, exciting, musical, boring, tiresome, fantastic, and all in all way too long  never thought i'd say this but thank god for monday's!"
studying the crap out of a song for piano!!
still studying piano stuff!! im freaking out about this song!!
"sometimes it's the simple thing that make you want to fall into a pit and escape the world  how whimsically awful you are for your disapproval  <propfemale> on with your misfitted disgust and i'll return the gesture  smile  \p s  hate is a string word but it totally fits"
"gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\but wonder on, till truth make all things plain "
it's not worth my sanity and neither  are you    but i already lost both 
im so shiny!! ugh  i do not photograph well at all 
the sanctuary within was torn asunder and you remain oblivious to his plight  so concerned with the alteration of the state of the world that you miss the individual  what could be done to bring your attention the the inner and outer torture of that one individuals soul?
~wonderful~
i think i felt better when you hated me  at least you felt something for me then  now its like i'm just another stranger that doesn't get a second thought  why is it so hard for me to get over this  sad  i need more distractions   
it's so hard to say things to certain people  don't you hate liking people you shouldn't  life is cruel!!  heart-broken 
"we all have secrets, but mine are pretty public "
today was freakin amazing
"i was soooo close!! what's wrong with me, why didn't i just go for it? i don't think i'll ever get a <propmale> like that again   "
i love blue eyes    there's just something about them      love 
never wish or hope for anything cause in the end it always lets you down 
"you won't even see me coming, i'm invisible to you  i'm invincible when i'm invisible"
"lying facedown on my floor with my ipod on, just    thinking"

the best of people have the worst intentions 
every tear i shed is another reason for m to hate you!
sitting in the dark in my room thinking about how he's not thinking about me   
i feel as though i'm forgetting something but at this point i couldn't care less
