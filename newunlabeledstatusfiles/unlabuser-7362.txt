"great post i had to share: i was reminded of something important: if you're not being treated with love & respect, check your price tag  perhaps you've marked yourself down  it's you who tells people what you're worth by what you accept  get off the clearance rack and get behind the glass where they keep the valuables! learn to value yourselfâ€¦ more! if you don't, no one else will! re-post if you like, you may help someone see just how valuable they are "
