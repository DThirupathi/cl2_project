"we all learn to make mistakes and run from them with no direction\\we'll run from them with no conviction \\well now i'm told that this is life\\and pain is just a simple compromise\\so we can get what we want out of it\\would someone care to classify, \\of broken hearts and twisted minds\\so i can find someone to rely on"
eeeew! my sister is soooo weird! she tried to lick me!  playful  blech no wonder why she doesn't have any normal friends  smile 
"haha my brother must have been sleepwalking cause he walked into my room and we were like \are you awake?\"" and we snapped in his face and he turned around and walked back to his room   laugh """
"we've learned to run from anything uncomfortable\\we've tied our pain below and no one ever has to know\\that inside we're broken, i tried to patch things up again \\to cut my tears and kill my fears but have i told you how i  \\i'm not going \\cause i've been waiting for a miracle and i'm not leaving\\i won't let you let you give up on a miracle\\cause it might save you\-miracle, paramore (aka the best band ever )"
"? first my sister trys licking me, and now shes petting my head    umm i'm a little scared   "

"sagittarius are far from lazy but this motivation to move on is due to\their hatred of boredom  boredom is their fear and instead of facing\it, they will up and leave in search of something more stimulating \\am i allowed to say i'm bored all the time now?"
my freakin' sister just karate chopped me in da face!  playful 
"just talk yourself up, and tear yourself down\\you've hit your one wall, now find a way around\\well what's the problem? you've got a lot of nerve\i never wanted to say this, you never wanted to stay\\i put my faith in you, so much faith, and then you just threw it away\\-for a pessimist, i'm pretty optimistic >>paramore<<"
