"ran the 4 48 mile drumstick dash in the rain in 50:56, 11:23 minute pace on average! happy thanksgiving!"
thanksgiving is such a wonderful time of year for many reasons   1  my brother and mom are home from the hospital and my brother seems to be doing better   he just needs to develop more of an appetite   2  i got to run in the drumstick dash this morning and both of my parents tagged along   3   i get to eat really good food that my mom and family made and not feel guilty about it  (refer to number 2) 
"nothing like a 4 mile run in the cold to cement in your neighbor's minds that you are crazy!  yes, but why be normal when crazy feels so good!  what an appropriate thought for a day filled with torts   back to the books! (or my outline)"
2 finals down 2 more to go!  a weekend of running (jingle <propfemale> jog 5k) and property!  what more could a girl wish for?

"taking at least three weeks off of running   phsyical therapist said that i could spin twice a week, lift and do yoga once though    i love it when an injury feels like it has resolved then comes back with a vengeance!"
"so i have been a little anxious about grades   anyone else there? so i went in search of one of my favorite bible verses   jeremiah 29:11-for i know the plans i have for you,â€� declares the lord, â€œplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future  we may not know all of our grades but god does and it is good!"
i have decided that today is going to be a good day!  if attitude is everything today should be a winner!
so it is thursday and spinning was great!  my spinning instructor has deemed this a no whining day!  i could not agree more!  be thankful for who and where you are and move forward!  no whining allowed!  ten push ups for every whine!  so just save time and done whine!  maybe work out anyway though!

"so i got up this morning to do my 3 mile run (which i did inside thanks to the bad weather)  i went to the gym and one of my spinning buddies joined me close to the end   my run went well but i found it to be really difficult   to which my friend commented, \maybe it was hard b c you missed spinning thursday!\"""""
promoted this morning to 3 5 <propmale>!
"spinning this morning, followed by a productive day, a run this evening (3 5 wonderful <propmale>) and homework followed by the good wife   what a great day! hope everyone else is doing well!"
"a lady told me today at the gym that she wanted to get in shape before she started to go to spinning classes!  i have heard this argument so many times and just have to make the point that if you are using this as an excuse you have got this backwards   you spin so that you can get into shape!!! it does not matter that you are not the best   if that is what you are waiting for, it will be a long time!"
good luck to those taking the bar exam today and tomorrow! my prayers are with you!
