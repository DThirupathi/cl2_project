been working 13 days straight   thats 156 hours of my life i will never get back   and everyone wonders why i drink 
"there is no one in eastern oregon  after half a beer at the empty local pud, i decided to go to visit my fellow ruggers in portland "
i get to drive all the way to minnesota and spend 17 days there   i hope i can escape   at least i can piss people off after <propmale> bush runs all over the vikings
there are always good things and bad things in life   the benifit about living in the usa is the opportunity of making the best of life   
my goal  be fast enough   be strong enough   be smart enough to make it at super league   i'm not blowing smoke   want to be pushed   want to learn   let me know   i want you to push me back  in mn this week but next week  who knows?
i haven't hit anyone in 65 days and stuck in mn    getting angry   
gobble gobble
can't sleep   too excited  tomorrow is going to be better than going to disneyland
thanks everyone! had the best birthday weekend i could ever imagine  a little dissapointed now because there is no way number 26 or beyone will live up to it 
now i know why it isn't a good idea to drink and snowboard   you get more balls and less talent 
<propfirst> is ready to head back home
"goif on saturday, skiing on sunday   pretty good weekend "
my new snowboard should be delivered tomorrow   and i'm going home friday   life is good today 
it's like the night before christmas   excited to go home again 
you never realize how much shit you aquire until you try to move from one hotel to another    yes   one hotel to another 
saw a turkey on my project near bickelton (that's bum fuck washington for all you city folk)  i gobbled at him   he gobbled back   made the day a little better 
"i may only be 25  but when i take a look back on what i've done in life, there is only one thing to say  \thank god someone took pictures!\"""""
i love my adopted state of arizona   they don't rely on the federal government   they take care of it themselves!
maggotfest    it's like christmas in the spring 
played great rugby and got an invite to tour with the gypsies    what a maggotfest!
gobble gobble   turkeys walk the plateau of washington like a gang   i swear they were packing heat 
"happy remember the alamo day!  mexican's don't celebrate this day, but god bless <propfemale> for finding yet another excuse to drink!  i join our tradition of e playful laining our alcoholism "
it's been way too long since i've been home   but it's always like christmas when i do 
not only did i go white trash and live in a 5th wheel  but made it a box wine saturday 
"breakfast in the morning never makes the list of decisions when i wake up   usually it is to shower or not   don't worry, about 90% of the time i get up in time for that   but thank god for brinner   bacon before bed is always a good feeling "
in salt lake city  half way there   colorado better get ready 
"wtf? have not decided if i like <propmale> or not   hot chicks, cold receptions, free booze, roller coasters, shitty traffic, big black bouncers, <propfirst> elway, <propmale>, <propfirst>, and god damn <propfirst> <propmale> "
ok   so only played 1 2 of a game in steamboat springs before i dislocated my right wrist and tore all the ligaments   yes i have to have surgery when i get back but this was one hell of a tourni   gobble gooble
"quote of the day \try dumbing it down a little bit  you are trying to attract hot ones   not smart ones \"""""
can't sleep  no breakfast tea or bicycle ride can cure this pent up aggression   almost cut off my cast today because the wrist does not hurt and it just gets in the way   i really just want to play rugby  no doctor is going to stop me from mobile 
choo choo   all aboard tonight's train wreck!
"<propfirst> went to the doctor today, and the verdict is i will be ready to play by battleship   nothing <propmale> torn, just a few small ligaments in the wrist that hold all the little bones together   though, they are in place and healing   may or may not have to put a pin in the wrist to keep this happening again, but just a small <propmale> "
"dear home; i know i haven't seen you in a very long time, but don't you worry    i will see you in 15 days "
ok   apparently i am dense while sober and intelligent when drunk   also had a rule put on me tonight   rule 1: don't talk to girls sober   all because a certain someone woke me up to come out of the emu closet  thanks <propfirst>
wrist update   stopped talking to the doctor   don't trust her   almost have full range of motion back  every day it gets better and better   will start rehab in a few weeks   it still does not hurt   until i crash my bicycle   texting while riding is dangerous 
reaching out the feelers to all my rugby brother's and sisters   need the word on a good social tournament for sometime around february  anyone have any idears?
"last night was a long night   my sonicare tooth brush had a slow and agonizing death   it automatically turned itself on all night and no matter how much i beat it against the wall when it did, it would not turn off "
i shall be home in t minus 20 hours 49 minutes
gobble gobble    sitting in the airport waiting for allegiant air to open the ticket booth so i can go through security   i left the bar because the gianormous indian bartender smelled funny   there was no one else in there and i couldn't drink her good looking if i was in a brewery 
the party has started   headed to the pool
best feeling in the world      get back to the trailer all depressed because it's not my house and it is only 95*f outside   i walk in and everything is clean   forgot i did that thursday before my flight

"here's what i can remember   day 1 - thursday: fly into phoenix, go to drank in pool, went to cardinals game, could not ditch <propmale>   energizer <propfemale> that can always find me   day 2 - friday: drove to vegas, got very very drunk, showed up in vegas, made a lot of money, can not tell about big portions of the night   lost <propmale>, lost <propmale>, found <propmale> "
"day 3 - saturday: found <propmale>, drive to bullhead city, jet skied the colorado river, partied in laughlin   day 4 - sunday: drank in pool all morning, partied at the avi, pool party and strippers   day 5 - monday: drive back to phoenix, can't drink (hurts) found <propfemale> still tastes good, drinking <propfemale>, fly to wa for work  or are we?"
