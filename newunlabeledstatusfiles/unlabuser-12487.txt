last week i had the strangest dream  where everything was exactly how it seemed  there was never any mystery of who shot <propfirst> f kennedy  it was just a man with something to prove  slightly bored and severely confused he steadied his rifle with his target in the center and became famous on that day in november  dont wake me i plan on sleeping in 
the sun is up everyone  smile 
god bless the omni-particle
i promise that i will be back soon for now i'll return to my cocoon
walk away time to leave the realm of the familiar to find a place where sleep can come hesitate for one last time i shout into the sky to wake the ones i'll leave behind every time i close my eyes the noise inside me amplifies i can't escape i relive every moment of the day every misstep i have made finds a way it can invade my every thought and this is why i find myself awake
remy loves me!
where is my mind?
every time i close my eyes the noise inside me amplifies  i can't escape  i relive every moment of the day  every miss step i have made finds a way it can invade my every thought  this is why i find my self awake

this day has altered my perception  i'll never see things quite the same  all that i knew was misconception but all of that's about to change  i opened my eyes today  the world looked so bright and strange  now i see with clarity  i won't be your casualty 
this day of silence is bs  i don't care what it's for  i don't care what point you're trying to prove because if you wanted to fight for gay rights you would use your voice  any alternate lifestyle person who thinks they can prove a point about discrimination by ignoring all the straight people in their vicinity is a completely stupid waste of life  grow some balls and try educating people 
the world issn't rendered in black and white other shades lie between  don't view the world trough binary eyes you're human not machine 
it's not something i would reccomend but it is one way to live 
it's gonna be a long day  it's a good thing i have chicken patties 
"we live inside society, our presence is unknown we plot and we manipulate you to which way to go illumination comes across the world to bring an end intimidating silent force that puts us in command this is the <propfemale> of the ending it's the time of a new world order this is a new beginning where a new world shall arise, we scream on the wings of yesterday you're gonna die and we know it's gonna be forever"

i do it for the lolz  laugh 
"once again! any of my fellow queers who think they're doing something important today by remaining silent about important issues such as discrimination should rethink their entire approach to the day  as a straight dude with gay friends i feel offended when you give me the silent treatment as a \message\"" """

again last night i had that strange dream where everything was exactly how it seemed where concerns about the world getting warmer the people thought that they were just being rewarded for treating others as they like to be treated for obeying stop signs and curing diseases for mailing letters with the address of the sender now we can swim any day in november
