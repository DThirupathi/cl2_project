i feel so misunderstood    i walked in the house the other night after class to here <propfirst> in the shower   so i quietly shut the door and sneak down the hall   i take great pains to quietly open the door intending to sneak in and grab him through the shower curtain while shouting something    only to find him looking at me from the shower already e playful ecting it    
"well we are on the road   kc bound   lord we prey for a good, safe trip   hope everyone else has awesome spring break too "
got to <propfirst>'s dad's house at 1   we're heeeeeeerrrrrreee
"so we are at a screening of <propfirst> smith's red state   lol not only are there protesters for the movie, but there are protesters protesting the protesters   it's great!"
omg gut wrenching!
ok red state is    i am not sure if it is amazing or horrible but it definitely messes with your head!  absolutely gut wrenching movie!  i can't wait for the general public to get to see it!
omg!!! it is snowing!  there is absolutely no excuse for this kind of weather in march!  kansas city you are not making a very good case for yourself if you really want us to move back up here!
found out tonight that we are staying at the same hotel that some of the wwe smackdown guys are staying at   i talked to chavo guerrero at the hotel bar lol 
so i have been spending day 4 of our vaca in the grips of a stomach virus   luckily <propfirst> had it last night and not as bad as me   and luckily these things are very short lived   ugh!
today was so much better!  i have been weak and tired but not nauseated so good to go   tomorrow the parade and the museum!  woot
ugh!!!  now <propfirst> is throwing up!  this has been a topsy turvy visit to say the least!
"<propfirst> got the same stomach bug that the rest of us got but he got it worse   he got severely dehydrated so he had to have fluids and phinigrin and some pain meds for the muscle pain in his stomach and back for all the dry-heaving but it wasn't anything serious   he has been resting since and while he is sore and tired, he is ok "
i think we are going to try to head home saturday afternoon    we shall see 
"well after storms, construction, one speeding ticket and one 15 <propfemale>  wait for a train we are home   got in about 40 <propfemale> ago   this had been an interesting trip to day the least "
that is supposed to be diagnostic clinic   picked that off the check in list and didn't realize it was wrong 'till after i posted lol
banana
"sucker punch was not bad    not great by any stretch, but not bad   i will say that it dragged horribly   2hrs felt like a lot more to me "
