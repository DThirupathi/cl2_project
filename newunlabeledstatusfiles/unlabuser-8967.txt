"<(' '<) <(' '^) (^' '^) (^' ')> (>' ')> (>' 'v) (v' 'v) <(' 'v) <(' '<)   yeah i gots mad dance skills, what of it?"
my mind is so empty right now that i  dont think i can think anymore > >
"competition this saturday! woot!\hopefully we didn't make another unlucky boat this year"
"wow school work, tis a sad state of mind            very sad           "
"i shouldn't be awake right now             i think nothin is on my mind              i have probably lost all abbility to reason at this point, and thus am slowly    wait scratch that    raoidly desending into madness"
"my mind is a nice empty blank slate, sadly this is like them cd-rs that you can rewrite things on, and its already been used, so in the end its just this nice and empty blank cd that can't be used\ah useless mind\good thing i rely on my instincts!"
sadly i just realized that i can't rely on my spelling      
"maybe i should sleep now\night all\i suppose\*sigh*"
"how\ many of us really know everybody on our facebook friend list? here's a task for\ you    i want all my facebook friends to post how you met me  after you comment,\ copy this to your status  you'll be amazed at the responses you get   "
for some reason i have the urge to add an e to the end of all my words nowadays
"98 percent of teenagers do or has stopped believing in god  if you're one of the 2 percent who hasn't, copy & paste this in your profile "
off to work
"when joker asks someone \do you know why i use knives?\""\",b783864dc26ddab862ccded42bcb457b,"lol it'f funny that i just so happend to lose my internet for the birthday, but i will say thank you to all who posted!"
"i shall not be online tomorrow\and possibly the day after that\have a nice week all!"
"i am not online no more, well i am, but i am not, to put it in more precise terms, my laptop is the only one that is online, and i am off in <propfemale> land sleeping or the whatnot   "
yay! our robot is (mostly) working!!!
"specialneeds kids are not sick or gross, they only want what we all want: tobe accepted  can i make a request? is anyone willing to post this andleave it as their status for at least an hour? it's special educationweek, and this is in honor of all the children made in a unique way "
so i guess 100 is the <propmale> on game and application requests      
"i have deleted all previous application requests, and now i have a clean slate, so if anyone wants me to be their neighbor or what ever, then send a single request, and i shall accept  but you shall have to be patient, as i don't have very much free time    ever     "
