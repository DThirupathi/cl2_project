wow   never thought i'd see so many grade school classmates on here 
hopefully this weekend will be better tomorrow    
"stretching my beer muscles for the preliminary round of drinking coming soon   \i have a bottle of phillips root 100 for tonights festivities and am planning to find the bottom of it!"
i'm hoping someone will be around to hold my beard back if i throw up tonight lol
i have started a cause and hope people join 
i find it hard to tell what's on my mind; due to the fact that i can't see the top of my brain without removing my skull 
"please put this on your status if you know someone (related to someone) who has been eaten by a dragon  dragons are nearly unstoppable and in case you didn't know, they can breathe fire  93% of people won't copy & paste this because they have been eaten by dragons  the other 7% of    people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers "
feeling that fateful new year's day coming again and loathing it     
got a plasma and a new xbox 360 for this years festivities muahahaha!
"look at your status, now back to mine, now back to yours, now back to mine  sadly, yours isn't mine  but if you stopped posting about other things and made this your status, yours could be like mine  look down, back up  where are you? you're on facebook, reading the status your status could be like  i'm on a computer "
"it's said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship  these types of friends pick up like they spoke just yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live  and they dont' hold grudges  they understand that life is busy, but you will always love them    re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends"
