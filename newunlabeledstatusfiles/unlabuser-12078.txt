"i am now a member of mt  pleasant baptist church in carrollton, ga "
i woke up today and for this i am blessed  i have a wonderful family for this i am blessed  i deserve nothing but god gives me the desires of my heart 
"i have prayed and i believe, now i am ready to receive; oh lord rain on me"
"i go walking, walking with the lord on my knees "
what a day that's gonna be when my jesus i shall see
"happy birthday to me, happy birrthday to me"
seems that <propfemale> is in a state of apostasy  the thing is what are we to do  when the leaders and teachers or telling us to be what we want to be  we should be seeking gods will in our lives and depend on the comfort of our heavenly father  i pray that all of you will seek the face of god 
"when you feel that your prayers are not being answered, stop and ask god what sins have you not confessed  when we are in line with god then and only then will god give us the desires of our heart "
i spent a great deal of time doing what ever i wanted and seemed to always fail  i learned in the book of <propfirst> that it is imperative that  we take all sins before god  ask him to show you the sins of your life and as he does confess and repent 
it is not enough to just say to god i am sorry for the sins i have done  name them for what they are do not bundle them up as if they are the same  each sin is a burden that keeps you from a blessings god wants you to receive 
to repent is not the same as to confess  repent is the walking away from to turn against and reconize the damage it is causing 
if you learn all of this and take in all the knowledge of god as he gives it to you and do nothing with it you are but a dead sea  the dead sea has no outlet it can not empty its self therefore can not be filled any more than it is  we are commanded by god to be fruitful and grow 
tell someone how to be saved and teach someone what it is to be christian  do not beafraid to use your on testimony to show gods mercy and love 
<propfirst> was the first one to <propfemale> the gospel

"what about the islamic brother hood  if they take over egypt, <propfemale> will be faced with the choice of choosing egypt or <propmale>"

"practicing theology \our lives reflect our theology, our theology reflects our knowledge of god--what are our lives telling others about god?"
car dieu a tant aimÃ© <propfemale> monde qu'il a donnÃ© son fils unique pour mourir sur la croix pour nos pÃ©chÃ©s 
"denn also hat gott die welt geliebt, daÃŸ er seinen eingeborenen sohn am kreuz fÃ¼r unsere sÃ¼nden sterben"
perchÃ© dio ha tanto amato il mondo da dare il suo figlio unigenito a morire sulla croce per i nostri peccati 
sic enim deus dilexit mundum quod dedit unigenitum ad mortem crucis pro peccatis nostris
