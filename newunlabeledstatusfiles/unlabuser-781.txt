skipping sleep on days that i have a low responsibility quotient does a lot to increase my joy for the day 
"i had my doubts when i first saw previews, but <propfirst> pilgrim vs  the world was pretty awesome  chock full of geektastic fun "
"all my life i have thought there was something wrong with me because i frequently feel so awkward in social situations  today i think maybe the problem is the way other people act around me, after <propfemale> told me about people giving me dirty looks in professional practices and after the guy who wouldn't just go around my car when i stopped to check the mail "
"i am not looking forward to the new doctor  i'm sure he's alright, but i really enjoy <propfirst> eccleston (and for the not-so-geeks in the house, i'm talking television not medical) "

"damn you, last fm angry bear "
"i survived my first public speaking presentation  i talked too fast, my voice shook like hell and i couldn't let go of the podium, but they laughed (at the jokes not at me) and it's over  and now: is there anyone out there who'd be up for zombie-hood in a couple of mondays?"
