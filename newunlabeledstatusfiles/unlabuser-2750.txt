"â€œa loving relationship is one \in which the loved one is free to be himself -- to laugh with me, but \never at me; to cry with me, but never because of me; to love life, to \love himself, to love being loved  such a relationship is based upon \freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart â€�~ <propfirst> f  buscaglia quotes"

when your out on your own  feeling lonely and so cold  all you have to do is call my name and i'll be there on the next train 
"the plans you make, your path to choose  which road will you take? you try not to lose, but how will you know? and who's to judge? you want the answer, something to show  no one will tell, 'cause no one can know  ~ my magical quest begins"
had a pleasant conversation with an old friend and was pleased with how nice it felt 
without direction we wander aimlessly  without purpose we question daily  without love we yearn for connection    searching provides direction  uncovering offers purpose  discovery brings a connection  with these we find peace  chapter 1 begins 
i'm laughing and living again smile  thank you for everything!

sometimes a little heart ache is what we need to bury it and rid ourselves of delusions
i've walked this road once before and i came out the fool  the words you so sweetly used were nothing but a tool  yet i would believe once again in the sound of your voice as the mice listen to the <propfemale> play 
\i heard that you were living well, but you don't look like your living to me\383ad2f2bbe5b2127cfa0b79efdd135e,feels like drinking tonight  who's down
"was asked today if i will ever get married again  and i gave them a <propmale> and thought about it, my answer is prob not  i've seen a lot and dont believe in the delusion of an unconditional love  everyone including me has a limit  and from what i have seen most are shallow "

i just saw a husky and a pomeranian poodle tromping together having a blast  my two favorite types smile 
i can't stop fighting its not in my nature  i hope you'll forgive me for that flaw of mine one day 
why is physical pain such an addictive and welcome replacement for emotional pain?

i'm suprised at how hurt you are  i knew i would but i feel like our roles reversed  i was happy and brave faced  you seemed sad and alone  i'm here my friend no matter what
"im always here, always caring  i am capable of learning about my flaws and working towards improving  i have never abandoned you and never will  one day i will have to move on but for now to say it so simply  i love you "
"learning is finding out what you already know  \doing is demonstrating that you know it \teaching is reminding others that they know just as well as you  ~for all you aspiring and current teachers"
alright i'm off to the concert to learn how to shake my hips lol
if everything we were was just a dream than i'll thank the gods for the pleasant dreams  if you are just an illusion than i shall alter reality to show you that i am in control and am he that is meant for you 
"i choose to love you, i choose to not give up  i choose to be happy no matter the outcome  whether or not you choose the same doesnt matter because this is my choice to make "
"if your dreams feel like they are crashing down around you and you don't know where to turn  than just know that your friends care about you and your family loves you  and most importantly there are many choices and paths, whichever path you take i will support you "
"i understand more than you know  inside you wanna fight, hurt, kill anything that is beautiful  you wanna destroy others or more accurately yourself  you want that comfortableness that was there when you were naive to the pain of the world  you want back the happiness that will never be there now that the world has taught you a lesson you can't unlearn    i understand"
oh the joys of closing one night and being in at 6 smile 0 the next day  annoyed  oh well work is still a wonderful place to be smile 
you've seen me sing a few tunes with a smile on my face  but you've never gotten to see me pour out my soul with greatest joy?
"notice: guy looking for girl  must be fun loving, adventurous, and intelligent  enjoys reading, writing, and music  had one and lost her so communication is a must "
"i told you once that we were together in another life, and that i lost you in it  and it turns out i lost you in this one lol  i'm making a mental note now for the next life that i wont make the same mistake  so just you wait "

great day today  smile  now to go to a meeting and than to go find if i have any groove lol
love someone enough to fight for them and still be willing to let them go 
do stars once fallen long only to return back to the heavens that was their home? or have they come seeking adventures and tales of love far grander than we know? are we the muses that inspire their hearts and dreams?

"i'm trying to learn how to soar on wings like eagles, how to run and not grow weary  but first i must learn how to let go of the past and walk the straight and narrow path "
i'm so happy! i just found out my old apartment was re-leased so i am not going to have to pay even half as much as i thought i was going to!
"i\ learned today that im not sorry  and i choose not to be sorry  i'm not \like other people  i try not to give up even when others do  i dont stop caring  i dont\ walk away when you think i should  and i dont abandon the people i \love  and if that makes me a bad person or annoying  than so be it  i am\ happy to be different "
