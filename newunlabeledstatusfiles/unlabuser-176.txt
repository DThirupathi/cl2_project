"is grateful for atleast one night a week right now when everyone can be home, eat dinner together, and enjoy a movie together! it was a nice night last night and makes me wish they were all young again so i can keep them home with me  where does the time go?"
"is sooooooo glad to be home! tournament action was great-but once again the officiating was horrible  i don't know where the heck they get these people from but the screening process needs to be reformed-like everything else is that state  we came in 3rd, but probably would have been 2nd   oh well  they fought hard-did a great job!"
can someone please tell me how in the world this state can be having the $$ troubles it's having? you can't get off a ramp or get on a ramp without being charged something and their red-light cameras go off like a person's need to blink- there are millions of cars traveling through the revenue alone must be staggering  their next toll will be 'thinking about changing lanes' toll or something stupid like that!
"i mean no disrespect to the good folks of illinois- i hate chicago-between the red light cameras, tolls, inflated gas prices, and all other ways chicago gouges it's good people-there is no reason for them to be having budget problems    i tip my hat to the people that live there for putting up with it- but wonder- is it worth it?"
just found out she doesnt have to work tomorrow-yay me!!! i need another day to recover from the weekend anyway!!
wants to know -for those who are involved with farmville- where are the dogs? they have other farm animals and some not normally found on a farm-so-what's up with that?
"the sun is shining, no snow in the forecast and another day off   let's see    i wasn't all that productive yesterday  wonder if today is going to be any different? lol!! i do need to go clothes shopping for the hubby though-so    something will get done today!  smile "
"shouldn't be surprised how some people act, should be offended how others act, and couldn't careless what other people think   a wise person i know had posted on her <propfemale> \what other people say about you is none of your business   today- that has more truth then you know!"""
can't wait to get home from work and watch the usa men's hockey team play canada   go team usa!!!! it's time to kick some canadian butt!
"for my friend, jesus, a new facebook challenge   i am out to prove that my friends will repost, i hope i am right!!! let's lift up his name and make a statement!! when jesus died on the cross he was thinking of you and me  if you are not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ, copy and repost"
"today's accomplishments   all dishes washed and put away- scrubbed my fridge inside and out, got the kitchen floor mopped! love those productive days! what i do hate though- car repair fix costs! <propmale>'s truck-again-today only $50 00- possibly going to be as much as $1k when it's all said and done! poo-dgu!!!"
has to get to bed- gotta be to work in the morning   had a relatively good today! gettin' used to this stayin' home stuff   lol   good night fb friends- catch ya on the flip side!
today has been nothing less than i e playful ected yet more than i could handle   is that like a dichotomy between good and evil? i can't think anymore right now    let me know! lol
"grateful the day is almost over, looking forward to having tomorrow off-but hoping she still has a job come friday! trust me- it's a long story-you don't want to know! lol!!"
"well, it's friday and so far people i have talked to about what happened last time i was at work have assured me that all is well and i am still gainfully employed! yay me! i hope the sunshines today so the residents will be happy   how can one be irritated when the sun-i,e; god's smile- is shining so bright? it's an enigma!"
it's saturday and here i am- stalling before getting ready for work   no one should have to work on weekends   remember the days when if you didn't get gas on friday evening you were out of luck cause everything was closed except churches on the weekends? sometimes- i wonder what it'd be like if it was like that again? i'm outta here!
"well, it's monday- i have no idea where my weekend went- if any of you have seen it- please notify me, i'd like a word please!  so, i'm off to my real job- have worked my farm, my cafe, gone through most of my requests, checked in with my mafia- so i guess my work here is done   it's monday- do what you can with it! lol!"
wonders why things have to get harder as one ages instead of easier- especially when it comes to family and vacation time! ugh! trying to make it work when 1 2 of us are going full tilt in opposite directions   makes things very very difficult!
tuesday   it is what it is    lol! have a great day out there fb family! i just want to see the sun again! please? just alittle?
wednesday  the day you look forward to cause you know you're half way through your work week but dread cause you know the weekend will be here and gone before you know it    today is going to be great! i have deemed it so- lol- so go with it!
"well, i have to hit the road for a bit and when i get home, make it look like i have been somewhat productive! lol!! off to get my nails done and maybe bring home lunch! catch up with in a few, fb family!"
my day off is just about over with- more than 1 2 way through and i haven't done one thing that is productive   guess i am going to have to try harder later on tonight  maybe if i make a kickin' dinner it will make up for my lack motivation earlier?! lol-
"i love it when the seasons start to change- what i hate- is when i feel like death warmed over and i don't get to enjoy it   like today   would have loved to have stayed in bed    it wasn't a good one, fb family- not good at all     sad "
"is hoping she gets a good nap in today-had to get up wayy too early for hubby's flight-but then again, what else are weekends for than relaxing and catching up on sleep? right?"
well   so much for the nap-i got one- but it was during 2012- what a weird movie- but it only lasted about 15 minutes and then we had to get some things done  oh well   hopefully tomorrow will be better  my son's last two hockey games of the season- pizza party and then a mallards game! oh yeah!
it's raining   today is the day for the nap   wait-i won't be home most of the day   drats!! and just thinking about puppy going outside with all that water around makes me ill to think about him coming back in with muddy paws-ugh  welcome spring!
"weekend is gone, didn't get nearly as much accomplished as i wanted to- maybe i'll be more productive during the week   lol   nahhhh- probably not! lol!!"
"soon, today will be but a by-thought in the space of my life and i pray that once it's gone, no other day will resemble it as i knew it  for it was one not worth remembering   "
"the sun is out, the death grip winter had is finally loosening and we are moving into a new phase   tomorrow will be better whether the sun is shining or not- because it is my day off and i have nothing to do but focus on me! lol!! yay!"
"alrighty-went and got breakfast for the children, the sun is coming out, going to be 60* today, got some running to do- so, im off to get it done! hugs fb family- have a great day!"
"today, after work, it's on the rink for my son and his hockey stick   then home to get some more straightening done b4 the man comes home friday evening  tomorrow and saturday off though- going to be a good weekend!! yee-haw!!"
"well, no sun, but that's okay-yesterday was very nice!! daughter is going to take the test today to get her permit!! hope you do good,sweety! you will   you're my daughter! lol!! i love you liss!!"
"it's sunday   i'm off to work in a few minutes   hope the day goes by quickly, smoothly, and without a lot of grumbling   from me or them! lol!! have a great day!"
"hubby got back safely from spain, got a couple days rest, but today, he is on the road again! see ya in afew days sweetheart   stay safe! love you! missing you already!"
it's looking like more and more that foot surgery might be in my future   this is sooo not cool!! what i wouldn't give to have interchangable parts that can be removed and re-attached with a snap   woe is me!!  sad 
"loved the 4 days of absolutely beautiful weather we had, but alas, i knew it couldn't last- its only march!!! spring is going to be awesome once it finally decides to stick around!!!"
"well, it was a somewhat of a nice break   had some nice weather-my youngest turned 13 on sunday- had a great day! now it is official   4 teenagers in the house all at once   god give me strength!! i think life is about to get very interesting! i think i need a coke! lol!"
is watching new <propfemale> right now- aaahhhhh!!!- i'm loving it soooo much!!! the commentary going through the room right now is almost deafening! the girls are so chatty! lol!
"has a very busy week ahead of her and looks like most of the time she is going to be a single parent  hopefully soon, i'll get to spend time with my hubby and get to know his face again- right now- i only recognize the back of his head! lol!!"
"well, today was my day off and i spent it doing what i always do: cat to the vet for shots and an eye problem, yukon to the dealer for check up and oil change, kids to the library for book report resources, then to the grocery store, home to put it away and then finally- planning dinner and have some laundry to get done!"
"okay,so, today i wake up with pink eye in both eyes   whasssssupwithdat? no one else in my house has it- and i get it! i can't go back to work for 72 hours! not cool! on the flip side- my visit to the dr s office told me my blood pressure is awesome, my pulse was good and my heart is tip-top! excellent!"
"today is friday, hoping for a better day- going to be on the chilly side but that's  okay- it's going to be near 70 on tuesday---yeeeeeeee-hhaawwwwwwwwwwww  "
"it's saturday   weather's going to be awesome, yard work on the horizon, lots of sun and fresh air   what could be better than that?"
"well- it's been nice having the last few days off waiting for my eyes to get back to normal, but now it's time to go back to work   pray it's good day and goes by quickly- way to go mi state   'steam train a rollin' all night long   ' way to go redwings!!!"
whoo hoo   mi state- you rock!! let's finish it and make it to the final round! no looking back! and detroit redwings- everyone thought you were done- way to show them they were wrong!! let's get 'em!
good night facebook family- catch you all on the flip side!
"on my day off today- grocery store run, but first- it's my 2nd daughter's first official day of learning to drive   she has a good head on her shoulders and should do fine- just like her sister before her- she is a fast learner!"
"okay so, how much should i worry when the first question my daughter asks me, once she is behind the the wheel, is \how fast can i go?\""    lol- she did fantastic!"""
"2nd day off today and am going to make the most of it- have three long days coming up and i hope they fly by! <propfemale> did great on her drive this morning-but for some reason, she was more high-strung than she was the first time- lol- it was almost comical!!"
"made it through april fools day with only one person getting me! had fun with the residents with green eggs, blue belgian waffles, and pink oatmeal!! lol- it was a good day, the weather is beautiful- and, we might have another addition to our family!"
"going to be getting ready for work soon- then two days off   saw the lady housing the puppy we are looking at- he's adorable! we are still considering him, but i know a certain someone that really wants him  keep your fingers crossed and it might happen! happy easter to all    thank you jesus for rising from the tomb to conquer death! hallelujah!!!"
happy easter facebook friends! to those that celebrate the day with sweets and egg hunts- may your baskets overflow!! : smile  to those that celebrate for more personal reasons-god bless you today-who can fathom such love? hugs!
monday- a bright beautiful day and we are hoping our newest addition will be here today!! we are anxiously awaiting his arrival! tonight it's supposed to be rainy and yucky- let's hope he gets here on time!
"okay-so, scout has arrived and he is doing fine  him and <propmale> seem to be hitting off well and the cats don't seem to mind him! now- this weather is starting to concern me-rain with high winds and hail-2 different showers in less than 24 hours! not liking it! : sad "
"got running to do today-worried about our smallest cat, <propfirst>, he has a pollup on his ear drum or right above it and they are going to try and remove it today-i don't have a good feeling about this-im praying i'm wrong and thing will be fine!"
"yay!!! just got the call from the vet- it's not cancerous- it's out and <propfirst> is going to be just fine! i'm so happy- boog is very attached to her <propfemale> and if he'd been really sick, she would have been devastated! yay <propfirst> county animal hospital!!"
had a decent day today  hope you are feeling better <propfemale>- missed you this morning! glad to know that i have the next two days off to get myself together  the next two weeks are going to be looonnnggg!
wishes she felt better   such a beautiful day and i'm going to spend it wishing for unconsciousness with a bunch of pain meds flowing through me- great!- just great! : sad 
"is off to the grocery store, then to the paint store, then to lowe's for a new mower and then home again to get started on the to-do list! it's going to be <propfirst> busy day!"
why oh why can't i have some one settle a ton of money on my house so we can fix all the things that need to be fixed so we can get out of here- i am sooooo sick of my neighbors!!! or god- can you drop a tornado on their house? that'd be good too!
"off to work today   got so much done yesterday though! god didn't answer my prayer- neighbors house still there- so, i guess i'll have to pray for something else like plague or a really nice controlled infestation of their house! and yes, i have tried several times to like them   sorry- ain't happenin'!"
"day off today but more running to do today-post office, tanning salon, nails done, then come home to take <propfemale> driving, 2nd coat of paint today, cleaning my room today, also going through closet to find things for a friend! tomorrow is going to be a wild crazy day  too!"
getting ready to leave for work   hope today is a good day and that my sore tootsies will hold up!! have a great day people!
"made it through the day in one piece, didn't burn anything, drop anything, or insult anyone- atleast no one i know of! lol   good thing im off tomorrow- i need the rest!"
"is not starting off the day as she would like    maybe a venti spiced chai will help me get my state of mind  back in line   i just need to keep telling myself 'i love animals, i love animals    i really love animals'- then i won't want to kill them! lol j k"
"didn't get the spiced chai, but that's okay, got to have lunch with the hubby and that was nice  today- hopefully will fly by and work will be good  be good today people, friday is just around the corner!"
sweet   today will hopefully be a good one- much needed after yesterday! way to go detroit for pulling off the win!!! keep it goin'! enjoy the day fb friends    ; smile 
"wishes all days could be as good as sunday was- work went great, have the day off today-mo-mo is on the mend and hoping that things continue on this path-a nice, uneventful week would be wonderful-the only downside to the whole weekend- detroit lost sunday   and crosby isn't in traction or on the injured list   one can always hope though!"
it's tuesday   one of my busiest days of the week   let's hope that today goes as well as sunday and that we get out of work without a headache  son's got hockey tonight-redwings playing too- come on guys- you can beat pheonix   now let's get this thing done! go redwings!!!
"it's tgif- detroit has to win tonight- yay- the senators won!! it's going to be a long day, but hopefully a good one   soooo glad the weekend is here! good day folks!"
"good night- it's been 5 days atleast since i have been able to get on here- hope all is well with everyone out there   things in this world   chaotic, frenzied and just plain out of control   typical day! thank god- have the next two days off!"
"okay- so today is my day off- getting my nails done, off to return some items that didn't work out, get some groceries, take <propfemale> driving, off to tan, then when <propmale> get homes- off to peoria for <propfirst>'s game tonight  oh- and one stop off at work! yup- my day off!"
"is so glad it's friday- today would of, could have been soooo much better if people would just learn to be happy- i know it's hard   but no one said life was a cake-walk   thank od for people that who like to laugh!"
"it's \let's go to the store to pick out paint for your rooms kids\"" day   i'm almost scared to see what they will come up with  the rest of day will be spend washing and priming- yay me! : annoyed """
"okay- so, today and tomorrow off- finishing the sanding and priming- onto the paint and then getting the girl's room back in order once again! who said home-ownership was fun? this is soooooo not fun! lol- in the 80's today- i should be on my deck in my lounge chair with an iced tea in one hand and a good book in the other-whasssupwitdat?"
"well, yesterday didn't pan out too well   any one know how to smooth a wall that has paint splatters as a design that have been painted over two different time ( and no- not by me or anyone else in my house) cause right now- we are using 50 grit sandpaper and it's not working! started out using 200- splatters refuse to smooth down! ugh!!!"
"it's thursday and today is do or die for the redwings- if god has any mercy at all, he will allow detroit to win and take tonight's game along with the next three to take the series! i don't know what i will do with myself if the wing's hockey season ends early- oh and lord- can you please knock out pittsburgh as well?- thanks!"
it's nice to know that god is listening-  smile - thank you god!!! detroit spanked san <propfirst> and yeah!! pittsburgh lost!!!!! yayyy!!! isn't god good? lol!
"wow- that was amazing! thank you so very much for all the birthday wishes - you're all amazing! @<propfemale>- loved your song, it was wonderful and i loved the originality- loved the cha cha cha's! @auntie <propfemale>- you da' bomb baby- you know that!! i love you all  i have wonderful friends and family!"
"sorry this is late- happy belated mother's day to all you moms out there! being a mom just doesn't mean you birthed a baby-it's loving, caring for and helping a child- whether they're yours or not- anyone woman can be a mother- but it takes someone special to be a mom! hugs to you all!"
is glad the day went smoothly- missed talking to you <propfemale>- not the same when we don't get to chat!- and am tickled to death that the pens got knocked out last night by the canadians!!! oh yeah- how you like that <propfemale> crosby? oh yay- doin' the happy dance!
"one day off and then it's back to the grind stone   but- i got a lot done today- gotthe rest of my plants in the ground, lawns mowed, new hand rail stained and drying, got all the ceiling edges repainted white after the big paint last week- i hate textured ( i;e, popcorn blown textures) ceilings- it's practically impossible to not hit the wall! ugh!"
"today was one lazy day-didn't get home till midnight last night from <propfirst>'s practice, gotup at 4am to get the hubby's bag around for an unscheduled trip to waterloo for two days, grocery shopping, getting the couch delivered, laundry, lawn mowing and oh yeah- pay some bills   ugh, some days i wish i was on gilligan's island!"
"i might not be the most beautiful, or the sexiest   nor do i have the perfect body    i might not be anyones first choice     but i am a great choice    i don't pretend to be someone else    cause i am too good at being me    i might not be proud of some of the things i've done     but i am proud of who i am today! take me as i am, or          don't take me at all! copy and post this if you live your life being you"
"as much as i love this post, it's time to change it! i hope all my fb friends have a terrific monday-meaning the sunshine is shining and life is good to you today! god bless!"
"made it through the storms last night, <propfirst> had a great game and a great practice   got the man off to work, the truck loaded-taken to the landfill-unloaded and home, now- it's a little \me\"" time    what to do-what to do! lol!! got lots to do-shouldn't be a problem!!"""
is excited that the after tomorrow- i get a three day weekend  can't wait to get the <propmale> to enjoy the holiday with my family!whoo hoo!! enjoy the time and remember what it's for!! to the servicemen and women- thank you- again!
" i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of <propfemale>, and to the republic for which it stands; one nation under god indivisible,with <propfemale> and justice for all  repost if you think god,our country, and our flag deserve respect!! let's see how      many <propfemale>ns will repost??????"
"wonders why is it that when things are happening along all smooth and nice something inevitably has to come along and screw that up? i mean- really? i know today is tuesday- but it totally feels like a monday! i just have to remember who is in control and that if it doesn't kill me, it will make me stronger    somehow- that doesn't make it any easier!"
"it's like one step forward and two steps back, no matter what i do-your always mad   and i can't change your mind     it's like tryin' to turn around on a one way street, i can't give you what you want and it's killin' me   it's plain to see   maybe we weren't meant to be    "
"so far away, there lies a place that can't be touched, i hide the pain, but it's stilll not enough   time after time i keep running in circles   i can't deny what is real    you're the one   "
\this is my temporary home \,0385b6c204edca7fce2ac3cd9156be45,"we seek pitifully to convey to others the treasures of our heart, but they have not the power to accept them, and so we go lonely, side by side but not together, unable to know our fellows and unknown by them  \| |"
today started off pretty good- got to see <propfemale> and meet some new people- then as amazing as it seems- it only takes the bad attitude of one to make it rotten for everyone else- and it seems i was their target   i got three words for ya- get over it   cause i'm wayyy over you!
"knew today was going to be much better and it was! didn't get to see my <propmale>, but it's okay- i'll see her soon enough! had lots of laughs with the residents, my co-workers today- and am thinking that friday is going to be a good one too!"
"it's sunday, may god be with all of you today in a special way   i'm off to work   god bless   "
got through the day and the nasty little hurricane that passed by- now the reward- 2 days off and only a few errands to run on those days! oh yeah   can't wait!
"rain, rain, go away   come again another day    sssoooooo tired of water falling from the sky   going through a serious vitamin d drought   "
"my second day off and here we g surprise il change for the yukon, post office, tanning, nails, bookstore run, after a little break-son has hockey game in peoria gotta leave and will be getting home late-construction stinks! busy busy busy!"
going back to work   hope everyone has a great day   or what's left of it is good- this weekend is going to be a blast- hope all you dads are ready for it! god bless- people-   
had a fantastic day today-wish they could all be as smooth! weather is beautiful- thank you god for this terrific day for i know that come tomorrow-a repeat it will not be

"wow-whew, i was worried we weren't going to get more rain and we might actually have the <propmale> to dry out    never fear, there is more rain on the way and possible severe storms   just in the <propmale> of time! ---poo-dgoo 8-("
another weekend practically over and now it's on to work! have a wonderful day fb family and god bless your endeavors for the day!
