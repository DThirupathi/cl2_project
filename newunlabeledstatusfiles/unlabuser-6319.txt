but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ  to him be <propfemale> both now and forever! amen  2 <propfirst> 3:18
the lord is my light and my salvation -- whom shall i fear? the lord is the stronghold of my life -- of whom shall i be afraid? psalm 27:1
"too often we think we need a cetain thing that god hasn't given us when, in reality, he is protecting us from something that would spoil us "

"on my own, i'm nothing but a big mess of sin  but through jesus christ i'm made alive"
everything that god wants to give you is free! you donâ€™t deserve it; you canâ€™t earn it  thatâ€™s what grace is all about

"when offended by others tell god, not gossipers take it to the throne, not the phone!god reduces hurt gossips reinforce it "
"jesus came knowing what he would face, so you would have the grace to face what you did not know you would face "
