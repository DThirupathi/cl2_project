"something must be done about our shameful health care, and i will not call it a system i call it shameful!"
dream theatre concertâ€¦and i am still not touching the ground a week later can't take cameras into the venue so no more pictures    but i got a tour of the tour bus   rode with the stars to the venue   got to know wives and stars and children   ate at their buffet   then i went out to see zappa for a bit but did not stay long as <propfirst> portnoy (super <propfemale>) had me go with his wife to pick out a tee shirt i liked! so i
continued    so i was given a great shirt    he knew i was a pink <propmale> fan so he gave me a cd dark side of the <propfemale> (official bootleg) and i had to keep comparing the two   i did not wear earplugs because i did not want to miss a note   jordan the keyboard player is fantastic and he gave me his cd of just piano work   and i got to go backstage which only the family does    so all in all it was fabulous!
"off we go into the sunshine   our sunday ladies \bling\"" group is going to lunch and whatever happens next  smile """

"such an exciting week i have ahead   this morning the peridontist, this afternoon the family doctor, tomorrow the regular dentist for cleaning and wednesday morning the specialist who i hope is going to tell me why i got that piece of meat stuck in my esophogus and if it were an isolated happening i would not care but i have had episodes over the last two months where the food finally cooperated "
"okay, now we know   back to the hospital on monday so doctor can put balloons down my esophogus and stretch it again   glad i am   then i can stop eating like i have no teeth!"

lis is home   she is having minimal pain so far   the doctor was very pleased with the surgery and said all went well   this first week will be getting the pain under control and then after i go home    someone will have to get her emerging energy under control   she has a list of limitations!
recuperation is the pitts   lis wants to do things and when she does she has to rest for a while   i keep telling her she had surgery   the suture is not bad at all and calls for a tat!  i am getting no cooperation!
may all the saints bless you!

"it took 3 times to break and then we got into the mode of laughing at how bad we were doing   we are going to do this often as we feel there is great undiscovered talent there   the \pros\"" ignored us as best they could"""
