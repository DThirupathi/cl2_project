only has to wait 2 more weeks!!!
   6 days till my 5 month ultrasound!
holy moly! i'm a lesson plan writing machine!
this time monday i'll know whether its a girl or a boy!!
is watching football with my man while i write lesson plans- now that's multitasking!
think shopping with mom cured the baby boy blues!
is barely fitting my stomach in this uk t-shirt    the fashion toll i pay to support the best team in the world!  go cats!
can't concentrate because <propmale> is moving like crazy!
is worn out and in a bad mood
those parent conferences e playful lained so much about the <propfirst> pool i'm working with!
witnessed the most ridiculous private school bullshit last night    st  x's football team is full of the biggest bunch of white trash babies and thugs   do believe i'd feel much safer sending my son to a <propmale> over a private school any day 
loves feeling my little man move!
is starting to feel siiiiick     ugh!
is super excited about my first baby shower on sunday!!
hopes <propmale> cooperates for his 3-d ultrasound tomorrow!
has another ultrasound on the 7th to check <propmale>'s weight!  somebody needs to tell my cervix to get with the program!
loved hanging out with everyone today    missed my chels again     sad 
baby hillerich weighed in at 8lbs 7oz in his ultrasound today   will be 9 and 1 2 lbs if he goes to his due date on the 18th   his feet are 8 and 1 2 cm long already!  his measurements put him in the 90th percentile!  doc said i'm ready to go anytime    just gotta wait for my cervix to cooperate!
is super anxious and wishing these stupid contractions would become more regular so i could go to the hospital and meet this baby i've been holding for 9 months!!
out to look at more houses today! hope we find the one!
and deuce and baby <propmale> will have a new address in a few weeks!! the offer went through!
wishing i didnt have to teach so i could spend all day with <propmale>!
