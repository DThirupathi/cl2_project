"true love goes beyond physical affection  sure, sex is a bonus, but it's not the right way to show affection  that person can name all the other people you can possibly date, or all the reasons why (s)he's imperfect       but true love not only the chemistry, not only the compassion they <propfemale>, but the inclination to invest everything in someone aside from themselves        but what do you know, right?"

"my heart goes out to everyone in haiti, whether they have been displaced, died, or struggling  it's a rare, yet a beautiful sight when we see acts of humility being shown  this should not be treated as a feeble matter, for haiti is a land plagued with famine and disease  with awareness, condolences, and support, we can and will help rebuild this nation!"
"i thought i was able to grow out of this high school bull shit; however, for some reason, people just love to push my buttons with their condescending attitude  it'll be all over though, because i'll be off this rock while they're stuck in the same spot  it's a much better payback than any manevolent fantasy anyone can muster "
"i remember handling my stress, hatred, and anger by fighting those who gave me exactly that  every so often, i get those cravings fight  every now and then, i have to remind myself about the consequences  now i have a new stress reliever, which is staying up all night on facebook  that's one of the only few ways i can even get to bed on days like these     "

"i really about had it with people's diatribes against black women  today, one guy who was mexican was romanticizing about all white women and bashing heavily saying all black women are nasty  i can point out 10,000 nasty things about any other woman  stop blaming an entire group for what some idiots do  i have nothing against any race of women, but if you diss my women, e playful ect me to do the same thing "
