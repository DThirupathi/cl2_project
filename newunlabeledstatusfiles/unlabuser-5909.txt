what to wear?
who is at the parade?
your heart is my pinata    
"one of the hardest things in life is to watch the one you love, loving someone else   "
trying to make someone fall in love with you is about as pointless as trying to control who you fall in love with â€�
love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning â€�
"â€œyou can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see, but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel â€�"
â€œlove is not blind; it simply enables one to see things others fail to see â€�
"â€œto the world you may be just one person, but to one person you may be the world â€�"
â€œlove is saying 'i feel differently' instead of 'you're wrong 'â€�
"â€œi love you not because of who you are, but because of who i am when i am with you â€�"
"â€œi would rather have eyes that cannot see; ears that cannot hear; lips that cannot speak, than a heart that cannot loveâ€�"
spiteful words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks your heart â€�
"we cannot do great things on this earth, only small things with great love â€�"
"â€œit hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel â€�"
i am just trying to spread some love through quotes   
yo' momma!
wowee    i might be bored after the 30th    
"blah, bleh, blah"
ugh!
guys are cochinos!

night casts a spell that unfortunately fades with the suns glare
wow!!!
"as my niece would say, my homie-dog is coming into town  smile "
both my cars are out!!!! this sucks! i missed so much this weekend  sad 
"it took me a long time to be the person i am  to be honest, open, loving, and caringâ€¦ to be vulnerable in order to see the beauty in others, to be sensitive to reciprocate love  it took time to develop an understanding that these feelings are mine alone, not meant for anyone to control or reign over "
i firmly believe itâ€™s the moments of solitude that bring on the fears we must overcome to grow and become our true selves  it took me many years to accept that the greater weakness was denying myself in order to conform to a social standard of being or eluding others in the belief that i am always in control  i am no longer conditioned to fear fearâ€¦
i had fruity pebbles and woke up in the chicken coop   smile 
"yo, <propfirst>, <propfemale>, sim, and <propfirst>    que paso?"

sick with a not-cute hair cut   sad 
my mullet is now just a short do
"i wish my friends the best, cuz they deserve it, and i really hope two things happen soon    1) women realize their worth and demand respect, equality, and real love and 2) phasing out of boy-men  grow up and let the testes descend! not to all, but we all know at least one and the message should be clear  time to ressurect chivalry and respect!"
