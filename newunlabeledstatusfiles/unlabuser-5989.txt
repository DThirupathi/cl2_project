"school is going pretty good   i think it's not going to be easy, but it should be interesting   i love my history teacher   he yells in foreign accents during class sometimes   and he's very interesting    i'm a facebook noob (to use internet slang) so i'm not sure if you can read this  so can you?"
"well   i'm in accelerated honors pre-calculus, band, english, spanish2, tennis, and honors chemistry   my history teacher is from the east coast, but he's good at doing accents  i went to an information meeting about mit today and it sounds like a great school for me   also, i think i have a reasonable <propmale> at getting in (reasonable being relative of course) "
me and my friend scared the hell out of many children during halloween   i went to his house and did sort of a haunted house where i ran a smoke machine and had kids open the door and walk in so that my friend could jump at them with a scythe

i just added 11 cd's to my collection of classical music 
it was raining so hard today that there was a tornado warning for orange county   a tornado touched down in long beach but did no damage   our back yard was flooded in several inches of water during the storm (even though it is well-drained)   the street was flooded and water was gushing up the drains in the back yard because of the elevation difference   i was at school so i didn't get to see it   (sad face) 
i bombed my math final (c+) so now i have to write this sad face emote   sad

"i was playing soccer yesterday at the jersey milk company's park in ensenada, mexico with mission-trippers and orphans when this guy walked up and wanted to play   i don't know what was wrong with him, but he had a hunchback and deformed features, plus he was missing his front teeth   he had trouble speaking spanish and he was in old, cheap clothes "
"we figured out that his name was <propmale> and he plays soccer in the park every friday   he played against me in the first game and with me in the second   he was the goalie both times   guess what?  that broken old man can play soccer and i'm probably not that much better than him at goalie   he was blocking balls and he knew basic goalie strategy, plus he could punt it pretty good "
"this guy was just happy to play soccer and he fit right into the team with college-level americans and little mexican kids who obviously play a lot of futbol   i don't really know what to think about it because i'm still shocked, but i can tell you this   don't judge people who are lesser than you because they might not be lesser than you after all "

"i went to howie's game shack today and i did not lost a single game when i was playing call of duty (approx  3 hours)   in a game of free-for-all, i ended with 100 kills and the second place guy (my jealous friend <propmale> orellana) was in the low 50's   i would say my average was victory by a 25% margin   everyone was accusing my of cheating   this has never happened before "
"so anyway, i go to hawaii on friday morning   i'm buying a new trumpet   i'm coming very close to finishing a very long and very hard philosophical quest   i'm going to get all of my classes next year and i made wind ensemble   i just got a hair cut   school is almost over   oh, and there's a pretty good <propmale> i'll be able to volunteer at a homeless shelter a lot over the summer   so yeah   "

i rode my bike 15 5 <propmale> today to buy an electric motor from hobby people 
i love the nutcracker suite!!!
"i flew my plane today and i prayed that i would have success   i was great until i thought it would be a good idea to fly upside down over a building at low altitude   it hit the roof at 30mph   it looked like it took massive damage, but it only took 2 hours and $0 to fix  i learned how to rebuild a motor   no permanent damage+no repair bill+epic crash+learning new things=success   god answers prayers "
