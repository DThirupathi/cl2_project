first day at the it acxiom careers camp has been okay  i got to stay here until saturday so i'm hoping that it will get better 
"our frickin computer broke down! we got it fixed though  the it acxiom careers camp was a blast! we had to walk everywhere in 94+ temperature, though  the food made up for it  free breakfest, lunch, and dinner at a university  that and in the past couple "
i got to get myself in shape before going back to school  it is now officially 1 month till the beginnng of school  i'm going to start this 10 minute work out everyday  wish me luck!

i've passed my driver's permit test! now i have to start driving my parents to church    sigh  my book hasn't gotten anywhere  plus all i think i've been doing lately is excercise and sleep  oh and read 
"i'm not liking speech so much  one day into the school year and we already have to write an essay  i can't wait until christmas break when i get out of their  other than speech, i don't have any complaints except my hand will probably fall off from writing so many notes "
i've been feeling kinda down this week but i don't know why  it's like i have a bunch of weights on my shoulders  i feel like i can't function   all i want to do is sleep and eat  video games don't have the same thrill as they once had  this must be the weight of responsibility and the 10th grade    lol psych!!!
i feel lonely  nobody is on    sigh
i'm basically making new links for these videos i found
i guess i'm gonna go take a shower now
i didn't think i was ever gonna get finished with that speech  now i'm just sitting here listening to the black eyed peas - i gotta feeling and boom boom pow

finally we got the computer to work  i hooked it up and got it goin and mom got the internet to work  windows 7 is freakin awsome!! i'm super excited that it's christmas break; i swear i've never felt like i had sleep for 12 hours at one time but i did on friday  that's whats been happening with me  the new friday the 13th is being shown right now and i have to admit that i'm not getting scared 
"i just beat crisis core: final fantasy vii and the ending is freaking awsome!! i almost started to cry because it was also a little sad  my car is starting to turn into junk  my mom hooked her car charger for her phone into it and three things happened: the led lights that come on at night flickered on and off, the radio can barely switch stations, and the door locking mechanism won't work anymore     crying "
"this life is nothing but a trial, full of it's pleasures and let-downs  however, what we receive when we let that last breath go is more satisfying than anything this world can give us  so buckle up, <propmale>, because it's going to be one bumpy ride"
<propfemale> christmas to everyone!
it's freakin cold in this house! i think it's like 30-40 degrees in in the computer room  i can't believe i'm saying this but i'm actually missing school  it's kinda boring at the house i'm actually considering going back to bed with my new pillow    yeah i'll do that  see ya later
"when you close your doors, and make darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, god is within, and your genius is within  and what need have they of light to see what you are doing?"
happy new year!!!!
"yes! no school! it kinda sucks because i wanted to see <propfemale> but oh well, i'll see her tomorrow "
this house is way too dang cold  i wearin a new american eagle hoodie and an eskimo looking jacket  i think the temperature is around 20-30 in this house

"i feel like i'm going to pass my driver's test on wednsday  dad and me went through all of perryville, done the driving course at least 3 times frontwards and at least 2 times backwards, and we went through all of <propfirst>  after all that, dad said i quote \ drive like a freaking old timer and i need to speed it up\"""""
love is like a fire: it burns extremely hot and it can change it's heat in a instant  you never know when it will flare up or burn down to cinders  all you can do is keep adding kindling and hope the flame will stay burning forever

note to self: leg cramps can cause strange behavior and extreme cussing
"following god increases your <propfemale>, kindness, and wisdom disobeying him only increases your sin    which one would you rather have?"

"my house seems to get weirder everyday  the other day, i was doing my homework and i look to talk to dad and i see mom drinking a gallon of straight pickle juice! then just moments ago, mom had one of her spells where she doesn't talk right and she can't understand what other people are saying  i can't get any of my words to penetrate her thick skull  but on a happy note i beat killzone 2"
"i didn't know their was no school today until 9 o' clock this morning! now i'm hearing that we won't have school tommorrow either! woohoo! this would be a good time to get some stuff done with my book \star fire\"" """

mohandas k  gandhi:  an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind 
rare happening occured  me and dad almost got into a fight over me and mom accidently falling asleep in church  the farthest we got was a heated discussion and i think it was a draw  he's afraid it will hurt his public image and i told him he shouldn't care about that  he needs to support mom because she's going through a rough time  never mind all this    we'll work it out

may be getting a new phone tomorrow due to a loophole! apparently it's less e playful ensive to get a phone and a free one with it than paying money for going over your text message limit  woo hoo!
"activating my new phone hasn't gone as planned  apparantly, you need the last four digits of your social security #, but i don't know either mine or dad's so i'm screwed lol! i guess i'm gonna have to wait until he gets home so he can do it    dang it "
had the weirdest dang bus ride of my life just now  i was sitting with this girl and this kid asked if he could sit with us  i said sure and he jumped over me and landed in the girl's lap and she didn't mind  his legs were hanging out in the asile and he kept on trying slap and kick me  the bad thing was his legs were pressing down on my algebra ii book and it was putting on pressure on my      you know 
i finally got my phone activated! dad pulled a trick on me though  i thought i was going to get the black one but i found out that his phone # was on it so we swicthed  i now have a blazing red samsung intensity  ( it looks kinda pink to me)      -sigh-
