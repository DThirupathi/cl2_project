so i was thinking and decided i got replaced    nothing else    thats just what happened    haha of course i could be wrong    but fot now i think thats what happened
"doin me for awhile    im still young so why not??? done doin the same thing all the time    so im tryin sumthin new    imma do what i want, cuz i want    and not care what anyone thinks about it    new me"

i wish i could go back and change what u think    everything feels so much differnt now    i dont like it:-\\    i donno maybe time will change some things maybe not    i guess all i can do is wait and see    maybe ill just move on and kno why everything happened the way it did   
really missin it right now ugh
i really want some soft serve ice cream    who wants to bring me some????
just watched the original karate kid    thinkin bout some stuff bout to go to sleep i think    i kinda want some cereal tho    but i thinks its alittle too late to be eatin stuff    but im hungry hmmm    maybe ill have some salad   
not going to work today     annoyed
