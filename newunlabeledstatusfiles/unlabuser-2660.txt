relaxing at home on his computer
sometimes the easiest way to find out an answer is to simply ask!
sleep?? whats that? i have been informed that i can be cloned so that i can do several jobs at my work at once        hmm it seems like a great thought sometimes!!
"saw where the wild things are today and i thought it was wonderful, but than again i like odd movies "
"facebook e playful eriment- if you are reading this, whether we speak often or not, post a comment of your first memory of you and i  when you're finished, post this on your own wall  (you'll be surprised what people remember about you )"
so many things to do so little motivation to do all of them!
who knew that you could have an asthama attack while playing kickball when you havent had one in several years!!
it is just a great way to start the day wondering why there is a growing puddle of water on your floor as you do dishes and than taking the time to open the cubbard under the sink and have water rushing out at you!!
for all of you that want to know  my sink is now fixed!
"omg i dont know what to do! i finished the last book in the twilight series!! i have nothing to read!! ok sooo not true, i have a closet full of books to read! but its just not the same   lol"

thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday yesturday 
is just thinking
is having a good week on the job front  i had a job interview on the phone on wednesday and am about to head off to another job interview today 
"learned a very important lesson: when you go to an interview and have to do an application, you should remember the title of the position you are applying for so you can put it on the application, it does start things out kind of crazy when you dont  its also a semi bad sign that five minutes after you left the interview you have forgotten 2 out of the 3 names of the people who interviewed you   "
happy holidays!! i hope everyone has a fun and safe holiday 
saw tron today and enjoyed it
is thinking about what he wants to do in 2011    
wonders why it is that people say one thing and do another    it might be painful to hear the truth but it is much less painful in my oppinion to know the truth rather than be lied to and be confused 
check out the note i wrote about how my day is going that accidently got posted twice  its worth a read 
wonders why it is that every time he has an interview he is excited about it either rains or is very very cold out 
i am good! i waited until after my interview to slip and fall on the ice!! hey at least i was nice and clean during the interview 
is trying to figure out if he wants to trade his ps 2 in for a ps 3 or if he wants to get an xbox 360  i would like any input anyone has 
had fun at wine and wisdom tonight but wishes it hadnt been so loud   
went to a very awesome class at the workforce center on interviewing skills

saw black swan today and is not sure what to think about it
