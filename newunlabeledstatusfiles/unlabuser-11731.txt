"*points to <propmale>* <propmale>! go suck a tree    \bob:  surprise     "
the hardest choice i've ever made is taking a step out the door and opening my wings  second hardest choice i will ever make is whether to fly or not 
"who actually knows me? i bet nobody can answer all the questions  1 )first\name:____ 2 )middle name:______ 3 )last name:_____ 4 )age:_____ 5 )birthday:__ __ 6 )eye color:_____ 7 )nickname is:_____ 8 )favorite\color:_____ 9 )best friend(girl):_____10 )best friend (boy):_____ put this\as your status and see who actually knows you!  wink "

sometimes i wonder how the hell i know half the people on my facebook   i mean their all fucking crazy! oh nevermind    just gave myself the answer  _ 
"-kills <propmale>- thats for touching my cookie    \-kills <propfirst>- thats for just being there at the wrong time and place  \-kills mikey- thats for spying on me while i killed <propmale> and <propfirst>   \no witnesses ftw"
what is this feeling i have? this prickly nagging poking inside that won't go away  this feeling that drives me crazy but yet steers me  is it my love or just my inner lunatic feeling restless   
"for everything i have done or have failed to do,\i'm sorry "
today sucks
