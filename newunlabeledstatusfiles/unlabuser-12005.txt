"time only heals when it wants to, i guess that's why i just can't get you off of my mind, yeah, when the walls come down between us, will you be on the other side?, if you say you didn't mean it, i will let you right back in for the rest of my life"

"you're always on my mind but you found someone else so i know we'll never be together, you don't have to even say it, i know how you feel  heart-broken "

"i can learn to live alone and move on with my life there's a million things that i can do to occupy my time i can wake each morning, i can go about my day i can fumble through my words until i find a few to say but the hardest thing i've had to do since we've been apart is learning how to deal with all this pain inside my heart"
"but nothing i could drink could help me drink you off my mind everywhere i looked, i saw your face and i wonder, and i wonder if there still might be a little space in your heart for me 'cause i'm so cold, i'm so alone and i miss you, babe"
somethings you can't take back though you wish you could some things you can't take back though the glass has been broke an' the milk has been spilled an' your love's on the line some things you can't take back
"don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when i talk, told you this is my fault, next time, there wont be a next time, i apologize, even though i know it's lies, i'm tired of the games"

"i have to keep trying with you, because the truth is, whenever i see you smile, it makes me forget whatever i'm saying and whatever i'm thinking  love "
"if it looks good, you'll see it, if it sounds good, you'll hear it, if its marketed right, you'll buy it, but  if it's real, you'll feel it "
"ohh man, that really ruined my day completely  crying "
love is like a <propfemale>  you know that reaching it is impossible but you keep reaching hoping that one day it will fall for you love 
you make me laugh  you make me cry  you pick me up when i am down  you never judge me  you always love me and i will always do the same for you   smile 
"always remember, i'll always be there to pick you up when you fall   but if i can't   then i'll just lie down beside you  smile "

"i have fought a good fight, i have finished my course, i have kept my faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all then also that love is appearing  - ii <propfirst> 4:7-8"
"you make my heart skip a beat, tie it into my chest, make me loose my breath, make me feel like a kid, and yet when i try to fight it, you do it all over again   love "
if a <propfemale> fell each time i thought about you then the <propfemale> would truly realize what loneliness is really like  love 
"you came into my life and you brightened up my world  you drive me insane but i wouldn't want it any other way, i'd rather be crazy if i'd never have met you  love "
yeah i talk to other guys  yeah i laugh with other guys  yeah i hug other guys  but none of them will ever mean as much to me as you do 
when you wake up in the morning sometimes you know that it is going to be a good day because you wake up thinking about the person that makes you smile   smile 
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they were left off, even if they have been months apart  they love you for who you are  re-post if you have at least one true friend  they will know who they are!! <propfemale> christmas!"
"i could describe you in a thousand words, that would take too long, so i'll use just one   perfect  wink   love "
"please give me, lord, eyes to see your star   ears to hear the angels' glad hosannas   hands to lay the meager treasures of my life at your feet   and lips to sing, like a modern-day shepherd, praises to my savior and <propmale>!"
"and i just can't keep livin' this way so starting today, i'm breaking out of this cage  i'm standing up, imma face my demons  i'm manning up, imma hold my ground  i've had enough, now i'm so fed up  time to put my life back together right now!"
i make no excuses for who i am and you either like me for who i am or don't; either way i will be fine 
"a smile shows what is in a persons eyes and eyes are the window to the heart, the heart is the window to the soul, always look before you give your heart away "

"seriously, could today be any worse?  sad "
realized today that i have no one willing to try and hold me together  i guess i will have to remember that when everyone else is falling apart   heart-broken 
"every day it gets harder and harder to fake that smile it gets harder and harder to fake that laugh, and it gets harder and harder to hide how i feel from you  "
maybe i look happy but if you cared enough to take one second to ask then you would know how i really feel and how complicated things have become  crying 
"maybe meeting you wasn't accidental, maybe it wasn't a mistake, maybe it was <propfemale>, maybe it meant something  love "
\across the oceans and over the skies,\f56093742a038c70eceec53ece367ce2,"never say goodbye when you still want to try \never give up when you still feel you can take it \never say you don't love a person when you can't let go  love "

"when i hear your voice i can't stop smiling, when i see your picture i feel the butterflies, and when i'm with you i feel    well there no word that can e playful ress that feeling love "
"a guy and a girl can be best friends but eventually one is gonna fall in love with the other, maybe too early, maybe too late, or maybe just maybe at the perfect time (forever)! love "

"let's see how creative my face book friends are    leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of **your first** name    it can only be 1 word    then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you    don't just post a word & not copy, that's no fun "
"sometimes, when you imagine a perfect guy, you realize you've described a person you've known forever  love "
"i'm falling apart, i'm barely breathing, with a broken heart that's still beating  but still your name holds so much meaning "
"judge me\i'll prove you wrong\tell me what to do\i'll tell you off\screw me over\ i'll screw you twice as bad\but earn my love and\learn i'm worth it love "
"i'm addicted to the pain, the stress the drama i'm drawn to shit so i guess i'm a mess cursed and blessed but this time imma ain't changing my mind i'm climbing out this abyss"
you screaming as i walk out that i'll be missed but when you spoke to people who meant the most to you you left me off your list
"it's amazing how you can mean so much to someone one day, and the next it's like you never even existed to them  heart-broken   crying   why?"
first match went well   smile 
life would be a lot easier if people would just say what they mean & mean what they say!
"if your alone, i'll be your shadow   if you want to cry, i'll be your shoulder  if you want a hug, i'll be your pillow  but anytime you need a friend, i'll just be me "
"i am who i am, i say what i say, i wear what i wear, i do what i do   if you don't like it then stop pretending to be my friend!!"
"one day you're going to wake up and realize how much i really cared, & that will be the same day that i wake up to someone who already knew "
