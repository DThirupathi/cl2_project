"well the wait is finally over!  on may 4, 2010 lynden <propmale> matthies was brought into this world by emergency c-section at 6:22 a m   although he gave us quite a scare, he is a beautiful, healthy baby   he was 6 lbs 14 oz and 19 1 2 in   he looks just like his daddy and i couldn't be happier!!  i never knew you could fall in love with something so fast    it's very emotional!  (cas)"
first day without my hubby at home w me and lynden  sad   it was sooooo good to finally spend time together     but i guess that doesn't pay the bills   (cas)
ok  so lynden seems to have his days and nights mixed up  sad   he sleeps all day and is up and very fussy all night long       gonna try to keep him up more today to see if that helps  (cas)
we had a much better night last night   i actually got to sleep in my own bed and not on the couch!! (cas)
looks like it's going to be a beautiful day   perfect weather for showing lynden off to family and friends  smile   (cas)
poor baby boy has been screaming all day     he finally just passed out on his blanket   hopefully he'll get some good sleep (at least for a couple hours anyway)  (cas)
whew    lynden got some good sleep throughout the night   maybe i'll have a happy baby today  wink  (cas)
day 2 of screaming baby   we have one good day for every 2 bad days   i need ear plugs desperately  wink   (cas)
so cute      lynden and daddy are sleepin in the recliner   love it!  (cas)
having an off day today        wish i could shake it  (cas)
i love my little boy but mama desparately needs more sleep     ! (cas)
we had a very fussy night   lynden can't decide if he likes his swing or not   he seems to take a while to get use to things   silly picky little boy      (cas)
got a full night of sleep!  <propmale> gave me the night off and got up for every feeding   love my husband!! (cas)
i really want to buy some new clothes but am frustrated with how things are fitting me (or not fitting me) right now   not used to having the left over baby weight    hope it goes away soon  (cas)
harvest fest o harvest fest   how you drain my wallet yet raise my spirits   are we going?  let me drink on it   and again and again 
i absolutely hate dealing with insurance companies!!  i swear they don't make any sense and give you the run around    soooooooo aggravating!  (cas)
so lynden will only sleep w me or in his swing (depending on his mood)   i cannot get him into his bassinet for the life of me    (cas)
i should really pick up the old guitar again and this time stick w it       (cas)
getting my hair done at 3 and then grandma <propfemale> is picking up lynden at 5 for an overnight stay so i can go to my chief residents' graduation party   i'm way excited! (cas)
"2 weeks til project earth   first and possibly only fest of the year   we really gotta make it count, not that i have ever been let down   rain or shine we drink all the time "
"oh lover, lover, lover you don't treat me no good no more       woke up with that song in my head   lynden and i always dance to it! (cas)"
project earth tomorrow bitches   pre party tonight but the matthies clan sadly will not be in  attendance  at least not the spring valley branch of the ever e playful anding tree   hope its a good time  <propmale> <propmale> matthies will however be tearing a new path through the park tomorrow   git down or git gone   g-yah
well we survived the weekend   kinda scary being out in a tent with tornado weather all around   good thing we were all way to drunk        all things considered   it was a damn good time at project earth! (cas)
"\you leave home and you move on and you do the best you can; i got lost in this 'ol world and forgot who i am     if i could just come in i swear i'll leave; won't take nothin but a memory from the house that built me\""  great song and so true in many cases     (cas)"""
first day back to work tomorrow   pretty stressed about the whole thing really   mornings will be crazy now with getting lynden ready for the day and getting the girls and him off to daycare   i was already getting up at 5 for work before he was born   wonder how early i'll be getting up now       not to mention he still gets up every 2 to 3 hours a night         (cas)
this morning went smoothly but getting up at 4 a m  is not fun! (cas)
sooooo glad it's friday   i'm completely exhausted and i miss spending time with my baby boy  (cas)
had a great time at my baby shower   thanks bunches to my sister-in-law and mom for hosting it!! it was soooooo good to see some friends i haven't seen in ages   love you all!! (cas)
lynden finally slept through the night!!!  maybe he felt bad cuz he had me up at 2 smile 0 a m  yesterday and wouldn't go back to sleep       way hard to stay awake at work   i was exhausted        (cas)
this day is moving soooo slowly        dreaming of changing into comfy clothes and drinking an ice cold beer   mmmmmmmmm        (cas)
"a good man was lost today    \we bow our heads, and raise our glasses, \on this day lord you can kiss our asses   \taken too young,  no <propmale> for goodbyes, \though the body is down the soul shall arise \\good bye old friend   allways in my heart and many others \p s  penguins always did make me smile "
"my eyes are swollen, my heart is broken, i just can't accept that you're gone   you were always there for me and were the greatest of friends   love you much and may you rest in peace  (cas)"
woke up this morning to be slapped with the realization that it wasn't a bad dream    it's real   my heart aches for you <propmale> g   so many emotions running through me   i can't help but want to be angry that you were taken   such a wonderful person should not have gone like that   this is so unfair    i just can't take it  (cas)
\\n*$*\\nnbk\\n*$*
"oh <propmale> boy, the pipes the pipes are calling \\n*$*\\nnbk\\n*$*"
