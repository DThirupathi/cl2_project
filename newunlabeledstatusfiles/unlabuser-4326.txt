"happy new year   i hope everyone is doing well and having a wonderful start to their new year   now to finish baking <propfemale>'s birthday cake so i can make the cornbread and greens and peas and    oh well, there are worse things than making yummies for the folks i love "
catching up on my reading   seems there were some gaps that needed to be filled  just finished heinlein's stranger in a strange land  it was a bit    strange  definitely not for my youngsters   maybe closer to college for them   smile 
wow! is it august yet?  three and a half days in and the kids are already at each other's throats   this does not bode well for them 
"apparently i share my birthday with <propfemale> day (from <propfemale>, dr  horrible, the guild and a bunch of other stuff )   woo hoo!  happy day to us and my other two friends who share a birthday with me   i'm in good company   smile "

"<propmale> had his very first soccer game ever and had a great time   he had a smile stuck to his face throughout the game, scored a goal and even managed to run the right direction the entire game   now to prepare for tomorrows festivities and jello wars "
"jello wars was a success  a sweet, sticky very messy success    and a great excuse to turn the hose on the kids as well "
mmmm    made pot roast for dinner and i'm going to make clafoutis for dessert (a sort of apple dumpling cobbler)   gotta do something with the half-bushel of apples the kids and i picked    smile 
"damp, chilly fall weather seems to bring out the domestic side  i've got dough for cinnamon buns rising, sourdough starter   errr     started and new knitting projects on the needles   if i start talking like <propfemale> <propmale>, smack me one time   gotta go play some d&d online to try to balance things out a bit "
"i've decided to give nanowrimo a whirl and see what happens   maybe i finish, maybe i don't but at least it will be fun  might as well do something interesting while i fight this stomach virus    smile "
"well, i'm already behind in nanowrimo, but i had fun yesterday at the park  i'm slowly starting to catch up    at least until my next round of writer's block   smile  in the meantime i found write or die which, along with my classical music, actually seems to help "
"woo hoo! i'm starting to catch up on my writing   looks like after the kids' bedtime is my best time to work  think they'll go for a 18 surprise 0 bedtime?  me either, but it's a thought  smile   now if i could just figure out how to attach my write or die badge on here   "
off to scouts with iain and then a thanksgiving feast with <propmale> & his kindergarten class   lots of fun in store   smile 
made a fudge truffle pie for a teacher appreciation lunch and gave out a half dozen copies of the recipe  hope i wrote everything down correctly   now back to writing while the kids are asleep      smile 
"happy thanksgiving, everyone   hope you all enjoy the day "
"woo hoo!  finished my nanowrimo with time to spare   of course, i refuse to even think about editing until after <propfemale>'s wedding, but it's written "
"woo hoo, enough snow for the kids to play in and roads clear enough to drive on  not a bad day at all   now to go bake some more bread and figure out where iain stands on boy scout rank requirements "
"it's nice to be back in greenville for a while  i'm getting ready for <propfemale>'s wedding,hanging out with friends and family and generally having a good time  i hope i get to see everyone while i'm here  i'll be the one with flour and icing everywhere     smile "
"wedding cake turnedout ok, wedding went off satisfactorily   now to wrap presents like a mad woman and get a couple hours sleep before the munchkins tear open the gifts "
spent the day with grandmother and some of my cousins that i haven't seen in years  it's really nice to reconnect with folks i haven't seen in a while   hope everyone had a great christmas 
"just finished making amish apple buns (kinds like cinnamon rolls stuffed with apples)   topped with them with a glaze not included in recipe and nom, nom, nom     smile  <propmale> requested a double batch for next time "
"oh no, if there are roads flooded, will the buses run tomorrow? the kids haven't had school since thursday and the last forecast i saw called for some white stuff thurs  fri   this just keeps getting better and better   annoyed "
"if the kids' behavior is any indication, we should be in for about 3 ft  of snow, no matter what the weathermen say  on a side note, anyone have suggestions for organizing a chili cookoff? i've had a couple suggestions so far, but would love more input & details "
"well, the kids enjoyed sledding today but they only enjoyed it in small doses  wind chill in the low singles? good gravy gracious! can't say i blame them for only briefly frolicking  at least nobody succumbed to frostbite   of course the hot cocoa supply may never be the same     smile "
and the snow is still falling   looks like another    interesting    week around here   at least the kids are enjoying it    smile 
"school's already closed for tomorrow and the stores have been depleted of their bread, meat, milk and salad   looks like everyone is battening down the hatches   gotta love those nor'easters  (me, i stocked up on cocoa and marshmallows  can't be running out of essentials, you know )"
"looks like after snowing all day, it's finally starting to stick on our road  yippee?  at least we've all got snow boots, scarves, hats and gloves   now to find a handy snowbank to toss the kids in  bwahahahah  er   umm    frolic, i mean to frolic in     smile "
"and it just keeps coming down  i'd love to let the kids out to play, but an hour ago it was chest deep on <propfemale> (just under her shoulders )  at least we have plenty of cocoa and marshmallows    smile  \today we will be learning about the inuit   \"""""
<propmale> had to clear one of the heat pumps and just came back in a few minutes ago   the snow was up to his hips    he's six feet tall   sigh 
"yippee  no school tomorrow    again    still     i love my kids    i love my kids    i love my kids     (sigh)   i think i'll use this opportunity to see how many forms of chocolate i can use for consolation   let's see, hot cocoa    <propfemale> bar    fudge    cookies    brownies   cake     smile "
"everyone who's a little tired of this white stuff falling from the sky, raise your hand  at least i got to restock yesterday, along with half the county   smile "
"the whole week? seriously? not that i didn't know it was coming, but seeing on the website was just so    real  sigh "
"i can't believe there is a proposal to cut the library's by 50%  i know money has to come from somewhere, but seriously?!? half?!? our poor school libraries are already struggling & we depend on the local public library to help make up the difference, without them our kids are really screwed "
"too gobsmacked to type properly, it's the library's funding that may be halved  town council meeting monday, march 8 at 7 surprise 0 pm at the government  center  i plan to be there to show support of the library, feel free to join us "
"wow  i attended tonight's town council meeting and didn't get home until after 10 smile 0  they were still going strong when i left  if <propfemale> hadn't been feeling yucky, i would have stayed to the bitter end  nice show of support for our library though, including several young people who got up to speak  (nicely done <propmale>, <propfirst>, <propfirst>, <propfemale> & the girl whose name i missed )"
"i officially hate surgery  i'm not a big fan of the anesthesia and recovery always feels like an eternity, but honestly, it's the \no food between midnight and whenever the heck we're done\"" rule that really stinks """
to my mom and all the other mothers i know    happy mother's day!
news flash    i hate strep  the only thing worse than having strep is having three kids with strep too  (we went from a tri-strepta to four of a kind ) at least nobody is contagious at this point 
and we're off to another day at the soccer field followed by a birthday party for one of the best sitters ever in the afternoon  it's a little busy but a lot of fun 
you cannot legislate common sense  some people are just determined to do stupid things  * sigh *
"as much as i enjoy watching my son and his friends practice for kindergarten graduation, i really don't <propfemale> having their songs stuck in my head all day "
"polishing off some leftover brownie caramel cheesecake  yummm    when you wait for the kids to go to bed, you don't have to share "
"wow, in the last couple days i've known three people who have lost close family members and another who had a very dear pet die une playful ectedly   my heart goes out to each one of them "
"my eldest is now a 7th grader, the middle one is heading to first grade and the youngest may be starting preschool in the fall  whew  now if i could just get them out the door and kick off their vacation   i'll miss them, but they're going to have a blast with grandmother   smile "
keeping my fingers crossed for a friend who really needs it and sending lots of love their way

"i had a nice relaxing birthday  i had a very pleasant lunch and got to watch a favorite movie  unfortunately the cleaning <propfemale> was a no show, so i guess it's back to the salt mines for me   now where's that broom?"
"enjoying the last day before i start my new job  yay  i'm looking forward to it, but i could use a few more hours in my day to get things done here while the kids are gone   smile "
"finished up my first day at work  it was a short day, so not too bad, but there's a lot to process  at least i'm already familiar with the place and a fair number of the people  looking forward to learning more tomorrow   smile "
the second day at work was even better than the first  it was quieter so i had a <propmale> to absorb information  plus i actually got to help some folks which is why i wanted the job in the first place   smile 
"just got back from dinner  i spent my day folding laundry while watching <propfirst>'s heroes, now there's a combination you don't see often "
"here's a thought    if you are going to insist on volunteering to do something and people are counting on you, do your job! (and no, showing up after someone else had to do  all the work doesn't count ) i now return you to your regularly scheduled evening "
"please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone, who needs a smack upside the head  people who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many  there is still no known cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head, except a smack upside the head "
enjoying my day off hanging out at home  i'm baking banana bread and crocheting while kicking back  that menacing stack of laundry is the only blight on this otherwise wonderful day   smile 
"iain got an invitation to people to people for next summer  we got a letter last year too, but this time the trip will be to england, ireland, scotland and wales  wonder if i could sneak into his luggage "

"kids survived the first day of school, not entirely sure about the poor teachers  glad we're only a block from wcms  at 8 surprise 0 traffic was jammed up  <propfemale> & i waited for the line to clear to walk back home, it was 8 smile 5  (tardy <propfemale> rings @ 8:20 )"
"i'm holding <propmale> fforde and his thursday next novels responsible for my british baking forays  first it was the quest for eccles cakes and now i'm going nuts trying to get the ingredients for a battenberg  with a new novel pending release, who knows what i'll be baking next?"
"if your mom is your hero, whether you are blessed to have your mother still with you, or if she is an angel in heaven, paste this onto your status and let everyone know you are proud of your mother and love her lots! xxx"

so sad to discover we lost a member of our scouting family over the weekend  my thoughts go out to <propfemale> brown's family and loved ones  she will be sorely missed 
"playing around with the uk citizenship test and not doing too well so far  i may have to console myself by baking something sweet  perhaps another attempt at a battenberg, a batch of eccles cakes or maybe a pumpkin roll "
"ok, i officially hate systems that only give one security question, don't like your answer and then lock you out  seriously?!? give me a break, you overheated lump of ones and zeros  one day, when i manage to go all tron-like, there's gonna be a reckoning  i'm just sayin' "
"tip- if you really want to get elected, quit calling me non-stop, especially with a recorded message in the middle of dinner  i'm taking notes, <propmale> and i'm bringing them to the voting booth  i'm just sayin' "

"made it to the polls before going to work at lunchtime  5 booths, no waiting  it took longer to park and walk in than it did to sign-in and vote   smile "
"getting ready for an emergency trip to sc to see my grandmother  if you need to reach me, try my cell  i can't make any guarantees about online accessibility over the next couple days  i'm just glad i get the <propmale> to see her again  you never know how much time you'll get to share with someone and when they are 98, and you've had so many, you want to squeeze in a few more if at all possible "
"it's tough to lose the best grandmother in the whole world, but she came from and inspired the best family ever  i am so lucky to be part of a group that cares for each other deeply and never hesitates to let each other know how much they are loved "
"yesterday morning, we went to get the paper and discovered a hole where grandmother's mailbox was supposed to be  it was gone, post & all  very annoying on top of everything else going on  this morning, my aunt went to get the paper and the mailbox was back, as if nothing had happened  *cue twilight zone theme*  smile "
"<propfemale> and i really enjoyed listening to the high school bands perform for veteran's day  skyline, <propmale> county and rma all sounded fantastic and it was nice to see people turn out in support of our veterans "
"just finished having dinner and topped it off with a kiwano (horned melon)  it was an    interesting e playful erience  looks like a weapon, but tastes good  next time we do a web search before trying to serve it up  lol (this is what happens when grandfather lets the kids pick the produce )"
