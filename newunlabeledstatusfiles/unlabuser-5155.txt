"fools you do not know, silence like a cancer grows    i am going to be apart of that cancer until someone scrapes me off from the world may the color i have left keep me barely in solitude, but only just as the storm is coming for i can see the lightning and hear the westwinds  may i join the water to its holy stone carved in runes and graves, may it provide sanctuary and prosperity while i diminish as my color fades"
