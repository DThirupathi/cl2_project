man you think you know someone and then they call you one night and turn out to be the biggest fundamentalist ever    smh    what do you do o'bryan you hate fundamentalist more than anything 
i would say in this post modern society we live in it's so hard to find the right words to convey your heart or emotions  everyone is conditioned based on their life and e playful eriences to have different meanings for words you say and when they are looking at your words through the lenses of their life how can they ever truly understand you?
