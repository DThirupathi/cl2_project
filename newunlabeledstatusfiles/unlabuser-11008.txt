i broke my foot on wednesday night!
"so      my foot is almost back to it's normal size  i still cant wear any of my cute shoes but, we're getting there  so i decided that it would be a great day to ride a horse that i have in training! well     i twisted my ankle and now my foot swelled back up and i got yelled at  (i knew i shouldnt of told him!) so, i'm thinking that i will try it again tomorrow and see what happens  can't keep a girl off her horse!"
"im dress, hair is done, and should be walking out the door for work any minute! but, my bed just looks like the better option! what do i do???? if it wasnt payday i would call in"
"how come a \day off\"" is never really like a \""real\"" day off?"""
"so     my day went well  i cleaned, did more laundry, and then went to kohl's and bought new pots and pans  after that went out to eat with my neighbor and her kids to culvers, where my kids had to hork all over the dinning room, bathroom hallway, door, and the bathroom it's self! they joys of being a parent!"

so    i just went out to get my mail and i got a letter with the worest new ever  shalone (<propfirst>'s dad) is being released on november 10th  he thinks that he is going to come up here and see her right away and act like he hasn;t been around for the past 4 1 2 years 
"and the worst part is that he isnt thinking about her at all  he isnt thinking about how him seeing her is going to affect her  he is just thinking of himself like always  the last time he was around and that disappeared to \live his own life\"" <propfirst> was 2 1 2 and she cries for months saying that her daddy didnt love her anymore because she was bad  there is no way in hell i am going through that again """

"it's funny how at work rumors spead so fast! and i'm not even there! wow, thier are some people that need to do better things with thier time or come up with more creative rumors to spread about me! this is craziness"
what is it that most men only pick out what it is they want to hear when your e playful laining something and just float over the important stuff?
"and       what is it with running into someone you have dated in a bar with his new women, everyone says \hi\"" than they text you \""keep away from my man\"" after bar close when they are the one's that came up to you? if honestly if i wanted \""your man\"" i would still be with him don't you think?"""

"it amazes me how some people walk around with their head so far up their own a** that they can't see the reality around them  that they think that they can walk around and say when ever it is to anyone they want, speak to people in what ever tone they choose, and act like they are untouchable!"
"the funny part is    nobody is untouchable because there is always that one person willing to \reach out and touch you\"" right off your self made pedestal     and i hapen to people one of those people that isn't afraid to \""help\"" you realine your pedestal!"""
