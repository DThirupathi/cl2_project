"that old cliche, 'don't judge another until you walk a mile in their shoes' has just been rattling around in my head for days now, i feel like i need to scream it "
it gives me warm tingly mama feelings that <propfemale> always asks me to wipe her tears from her eyes after she has been crying 
"my jello container just reminded me that \happy is still legal in all 50 states\""  i was struck by how cool yet what a sad commentary on the state of the current civil climate that we could need such reminders """

enjoying my first few moments of true peace and quiet in months attempting to fathom the immense sense of appreciation i have for my good fortunes and the luxury of having such a generous and loving family   there is nothing more valuable than the unconditional love and support of true friends and family   thank you 
"it is 2am and i am watching over my family sleeping peacefully in the home we now know will remain ours and, more importantly in our family, for generations to come and appreciating the value of old friends"
