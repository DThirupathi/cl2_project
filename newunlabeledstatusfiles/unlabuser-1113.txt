take take life for granted you might miss a blessing
dont take life for granted for you might miss your blessing
llife starts off with broken roads but as you grow youll see your path and look for the one that was always there for you to walk 
i  love you <propfirst> with all god will allow and one day we will be together
don't      worry     be     happy
the pain will go away when you feel the whisper of the wing
