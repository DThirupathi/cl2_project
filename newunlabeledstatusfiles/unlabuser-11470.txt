if you are going to tell everyone that you are following god you should really make sure that you aren't acting like an absolute jerk to the very people who care about you   that is not how god leads or behaves!

things that really piss me off: people who butt in and act like they know everything about you when they really have no clue at all   stop pretending like you know what's best for anyone when you don't!
it was good to see my happy family today   love you!
"they say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship  these types of friends pick up just like they spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far apart they live    repost this if you are lucky enough to have atleast one friend like this       "
