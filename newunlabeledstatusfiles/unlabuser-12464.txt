happy new year! -kairi
what a great way to start a new year     sick  playful 
i've had it  the view i have on the way how family should interact is so messed up i don't know how to deal with my family if i even should 
sickness is a blah feeling 
a true friend wouldn't second guess you finding you standing over a dead body as they came into your house  they wouldn't care about the walls covered in blood  they wouldn't even consider calling the police  a true friend would ask you if you wanted to go buy the lime or get the hacksaw  a true friend would help    y   o   u dispose of the body  copy and paste this if you have at least one true friend 
i just want all the pain to end!
"it's raining so i feel good, mostly "
