"had a great day surprisingly! ^^ had the feeling that even thought things are tough to work through right now, it all doesn't have to rest on my shoulders  people choose their own fate, whether i like what they pick or not, so i should stop worrying that i can't change it, cuz that doesn't fix anything  and all my friends helped me have an awesome day by just being there to make me laugh! ^^"

"somethin's been screwing with my connection for a long time, gradually getting worse, and today it finally sabotaged my aol messenger  sad  i hate whatever it is, and i hate the fact that all the computer fixin places around here would either screw it up worse or steal my whole computer"
listening to a beautiful thunderstorm c:
life is so fast and intense right now it's making me sick   feels like pieces of me are gonna crumble away and i can't do anything about it  like when someone has a certain amount of time to live and they have to cram in all the good times they can before the end     the word of the day is landslide
