"as a well spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death \\-- <propmale> da vinci"
why is that things are always so freaking loud after you drink?
about time! i got woken to what is one of the best news this entire summer  my sister gave birth to my new nephew at 3 in the morning  i stayed sleep because i dont think i can hear anyone scream when i pass out but to the hospital after class is over at 7 or so    
never spent so much time in facebook before and its all thanks to my 5pm lab in school
"life is like a beautiful <propfemale>, only the lyrics are messed up   "
well people i am off too tropical  taking a nap undear a tree and relaxing  you know how to reach me if you need me    
every man is afraid of something  that's how you know he's in love with you; when he is afraid of losing you 
today was a day for the books but what day with friends amd shots of 151 is not memorable anyways today and yesturday with that crazy rave things never let down         
everybody should believe in something; i believe i'll have another drink 
"â€œlive life fully while you're here  e playful erience everything  take care of yourself and your friends  have fun, be crazy, be weird  go out and screw up! you're going to anyway, so you might as well enjoy the process  take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes: find the cause of your problem and eliminate it  don't try to be perfect; just be an excellent example of being human â€� -<propfirst> robbins"
"another day i struggleâ€¦\to get out of bed \another day i feel like shitâ€¦\my clothes are wrinkled and i donâ€™t care!\\another dayâ€¦\just like the ridiculous day before!\another day i must searchâ€¦\for peace thatâ€™s virtually impossible to find \another day a thousand thoughtsâ€¦\go racing through my mind \another day i struggleâ€¦\to act like everythingâ€™s okay    like itâ€™s just another day!"
