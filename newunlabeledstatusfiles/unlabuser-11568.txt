"in conclusion, @hamilton du and <propfemale> <propfirst> are perfect beings and we must live a life without sin and imperfection in order to belong in their presence  although we may as never be as awesome (not just awe-some  awe-quite a bit  awe-a lot ) as them, perhaps we can grow and prosper under their influence and presence  those two are just legen-waitforit    hereitcomesandihopeyou'renotlactoseintolerant-dary!!!"
"finally, @hamilton du and @<propfemale> <propfirst> smell\great  i canâ€™t really describe the smell; itâ€™s something youâ€™ve just got to e playful erience yourself  just go up to them, bow to them (this is important!! if\you donâ€™t, they take offense and you lose all your hair after an hour), and\then beg humbly to smell them  once you do, you will understand the meaning of\life "
"@hamilton du and @<propfemale> <propfirst> are beautiful \seriously, have you ever seen them? it gets me all hot and bothered when i\think of them when theyâ€™re wearing heaving and unflattering winter jackets  once the summer comesâ€¦how ya doin??? their beautyâ€¦i must capture it on the\canvas  perhaps if we were to sculpt our bodies into perfection like they did,\we can actually ascend to being half as awesome as they are "
"@hamilton du and @<propfemale> <propfirst> are awesome\because they are cool  they werenâ€™t born cool though; they fought their way to\the top, although it wasnâ€™t really much of a fight  it was like beating up a\baby or something  anyways, them being so cool is an inspiration  if we work\hard, maybe we can be just as half as cool as they are by the year 2029  after\that it's too late  you canâ€™t be cool when youâ€™re too old "
"@hamilton du and <propfemale> <propfirst> are\the most awesomest people ever  their superiority is like wind\beneath my wings  seriously i wish i was as cool as them, but it would take a\gazillion of years of meditation to transcend into their enlightenment  @hamilton du and @<propfemale> <propfirst> are at the\highest level of awesomeness because of their coolness, beauty, and smell, and\i believe we all can learn from their success "
