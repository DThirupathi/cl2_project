i have the hiccups!!
its amazing how many people in this world can turn down a child or youth in need of help  their future is going to be drenched in more pain and sadness with each child's walking nightmare

its my little brothers 18th birthday and i am soooooo stressed
i'm a bright <propfirst> of sunshine !!!!
want to stop having depressed  people and violence? love  one act of kindness to a  child thinking of suicide is all it takes to change their minds  one  kiss from a family member one hug from a friend is all it takes to  make a depressed child smile  one caring parent is all it takes to warn  a child about the negative effects of violence and drugs  one smile can  change the lives of many  have you smiled today?
"on the bright side of life i have a roof over my head, i have a job, and i have people love me!"
my mom is talking to me again! woot!
the way of peace is the way of  love  love is the greatest  power on earth  it conquers all things 
can normal people feel bad for a person and be jealous of them at the same time?
"â€œwhen  the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know  peace â€� jimi hendrix"
"love in your life can make up for the things you may lack  if you don't have love, no matter what else there is, it's not good enough "
"to  the world you may be  just one person, but to one person you may  be the  world "
i hate walking in the rain looking for the one person who would make it ok and not finding them! especially when neither of us have a phone  uggghhh      its been a long day 
oh hey everyone my phone snapped into two peices a few days ago so i'm not ignoreing anyone just dont have a phone  wink 
is super excited about getting out of class tomorrow    and having some fun!
"to everyone that <propfemale> told, <propfirst> did get hit by a car, he was clipped by a lady that wasn't paying attention, but he is fine he didn't even get a scratch  there is nothing to worry about "
"\life is what happens to you  when you're busy making other plans\""  -<propfirst> lennon"""
it is a day for peace and oneness with nature  love your earth even if its only for a day!
