put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice- people who are gay are not looking for a cure but acceptance and equal rights    93% won't copy and paste this  will you make it your status for at least one hour? promote love & acceptance! not hate
all that i'm after is a life full of laughter as long as i'm laughing with you
thanks for all the birthday wishes!!! it was an amazing birthday and a pretty bomb 22 on the 22!! lol love you all!!  smile 
my best friend gave me the best advice he said today's a gift and not a given right   so live like you're never living twice don't take the free ride in your own life

"every person has 1000 wishes, a cancer patient only has one: to get better  i know that 97% won't post this as their status - be one of the 3% and post this as your status  do it for at least an hour, for those who havedied of cancer or who are still fighting"
