"i stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes  he stared back without apology  i felt like i could see into them for <propmale> and <propmale>, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could i see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken "
"the physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation \i was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition  it was a promise that could not be kept, broken, as soon as it was made "
too much to say 
wondering if anyone knows what happened to my boyfriend 
"baby, cause you blow my heart up "
"when i'm feeling down, you make that face you do  there's no one in the world that could replace you "
i mucked up 
i can't believe she didn't win
