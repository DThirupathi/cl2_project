"happiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind "
"i happen to believe the world will change only when we change ourselves  and that starts with finding ourselves  and that starts with listening to ourselves: learning to quiet the clamor in our minds and the voices of everyone around us and move toward what feels right- towards the things we know, for reasons we canâ€™t e playful lain, that weâ€™re meant to do, the things that make us feel alive "
"i have no right, by anything i do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes  what matters is not what i think of him; it is what he thinks of himself  to undermine a manâ€™s self-respect is a sin "
"the heart has its reasons, of which the mind knows nothing "
"good doesnâ€™t exist without evil  good wouldnâ€™t have a meaning, if we never knew what bad was  success doesnâ€™t exist without failures  weâ€™d have nothing to succeed at, if we didnâ€™t fail at anything  love doesnâ€™t exist without struggle  there would be no reason to love, if we didnâ€™t struggle so much for how much it was worth it in the end "
