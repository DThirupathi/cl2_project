"as long as the twilight veils\\the decadence we embrace\\more than the ones we love\\we're ardent, we're burning down   \\not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe\\not afraid of falling down below\\to the night, recklessly we fly\\like living dead, we'll never die!"
"living after midnight, rocking to the dawn!\loving till the morning, then i'm gone   i'm gone!"
review web for history makes absolutely no sense   surprise  t t
"i was born in ashes of molten hatred\\raised by the demons in abodes of the end\\the reaper's scythe i fall upon to light my path\\wrecked by mangled wounds of life i have become\\the resurrection of the evil one\\y'know that i don't ******* care if i live or die\\i need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins\\i despise everything i see\\anyone who knows the name of this song gets a cookie   laugh "

"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear  while you humiliate, offend, and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is  while you hurt her, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away  while you make her cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her  post this on your wall if you are against domestic violence & mental abuse"
