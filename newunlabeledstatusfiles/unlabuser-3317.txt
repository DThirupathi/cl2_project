"i'm tired but bored how is that possible? you'd think i would just go to bed, but i can't sleep!  guess if i lay down long enough i might be pleasantly suprised and crash faster than i think "
"i miss my old life    relationships i once had, people i've lost, some sort of stability that gave me hope, a normal routine where my kids got to school on time, house work usually done, coming home and being able to just breath instead of drama, feeling like everything was worth the struggle    i miss it all "
lbj = mvp officially today at akron university! woohoo!
"in memory of all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried, but never met, or held in our arms  make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby  the majority won't do it  break the silence, in memory of all angel babies, gone too soon, but never forgotten ?"
some people take & take & take but what will you do when there is nothing left? will you  just move to the next person? will you have left anything behind for the other person to build from? on the other hand some of us give & give & give will we leave anything left of ourselves in order to one day be happy? will there be a day when someone is willing to give to you just as much as they take? i hope so just a thought
"bored, tired, and lost but i will survive  lol! keep pushing for a better day it will come "
it's nice to see nate relaxed and enjoying himself if only for a little while  who knew all it took was catching butterflies with his daughter? bet he doesn't even realize it! it's those moments u need to hold on to!
"fighting a cold, tired as hell, and got a disaster going on at the homefront but i got a feeling things are gonna start looking up  now if i could only get some energy to clean this messy house id call the day a good one "
ready for the weekend already    going to watch the rampage rashad fight with my man! hopefully it will be a good time 
"good weekend so far i've gotten to spend time with some of the people i love the most hubby, kids, family, my best friend, and some cool people along the way! to bad it has to end   "

been a pretty good week but i hate feeling like silence is the only way to keep it that way  my mouth gets me into trouble and i don't even have to be running it lol  i consider it being real but i'm finding out that keeping it real gets me in more trouble than being fake  guess i need to work on my don't give a shit methods lol

had a really nice visit with <propfirst> and <propmale> today in tiffin! headed back home to maybe get in the pool 
well kyler decided to throw my cell phone in the bathtub today    so yep that means no phone for me and there went all my contacts as well  so if anyone needs or wants to get ahold of me looks like facebook or home phone is it till i can come up with another phone to use  once i get the new phone i'm gonna need phone #s again  so if anyone has a spare cell phone they don't need that's in good condition let me know

thanks so much for all the birthday wishes everyone!
"breathing   wrong, facial e playful ressions   wrong, way to ask a question   wrong, staying quiet   wrong, everything   wrong  starting to feel like there is nothing right anymore if the simple things in life are always wrong  think i'm finally loosing the battle and there isn't a damn thing i can do about it but just sit and wait for the fallout  its a frustrating and lonely feeling "
sitting at work waiting for the adt man to show up then gotta run to the bank for deposits  been a busy day at work today  hopefully i can keep with the pace and bust out some laundry at home today!
been a pretty rough day today  hopefully tomorrow is better  guess i gotta learn when to let go  if only it was that easy for me   
bored but have no energy    makes no sense! a lot on my mind but things are chill so i guess that's a plus  going to cedar point sunday hopefully that will end up a fun day  i'm afraid of heights and don't care for rollar coasters so we'll see if i get brave or punk out on riding the rides  either way i'll be with people i love so it should be a good time 
"cooking dinner, got kids a bath, got dishes done for the most part    almost time to relax "
well i survived the millinium force yesterday  didn't open my eyes once but i made it through the ride lol  had a wondful day with my husband from start to finish and had a blast with my sister and <propfirst>  love you guys!
sitting with my little man watching some cartoons  up next <propfirst> mouse clubhouse! woohoo lol 
trying to get motivated to get some housework done but its just not happening  i am so exhausted today  can't wait till my man gets off work ready to cuddle for the evening 
"yay cold front! it's gonna be a beautiful day    working on laundry, headed to work, and then let the <propmale> paying begin  i'm gonna try to make this a productive day since yesterday didn't work in my favor lol "
"if you have a sister who has made you laugh, wiped your tears, hugged you tight, watched you succeed, saw you fail, cheered you on and kept you strong, copy and paste this to your status \ sisters are a promise from god that we will have a friend forever! love you <propfemale> your the best!"""
another day of laundry  hopefully not as chaotic! my hubby has then entire weekend off so hopefully its gonna be a nice relaxing one 
"in a pissy mood  sucks was hoping for a nice weekend  messy house, kids not listening    just overwhelmed i guess "
well its midnight and i finally have piece and quiet so why am i bored? lol! i'm tired too but don't wanna waste this relaxing moment lol  so do i watch more tv or go to bed? hmmmm   ?
nate and i have had a rough year but i must say i'm proud of him right now and what he is trying to accomplish  i am really missing him being here  his 12 hr days seem to last forever and his time at home goes by so fast  can't wait for sunday when we can spend some time together 
trying to stay positive and focused on the future  hopefully things are gonna turn around for me and my family and we will finally get to a place where nothing can hold us down  got high hopes!

well disappointed my plans for family time fell through but my girls and i are headed to italian fest 
had a good time last night despite everything else going on    now waiting to watch me some football!
starving ready for supper! it's in progress and its only 5 o'clock  that's a record for us lol  we usually have late dinners  actually ready for the weekend to be over 
watching the football game i've been waiting anxiously for yet i'm bored and wanna do something  ugh i hate this feeling 
woke up this morning covered in toilet paper  my son decided to tp me in my sleep lmao!

well plans for school shopping changed to friday but i got <propfemale> registered  gonna try to clean house a little before the hubby gets off work 
been a really long day between dealing with some screaming kids all day and cleaning i'm so ready for bed  if only the kids were i'd be set lol 
"well had a pretty good day with my kiddos  <propfemale> went to work with me, we went out to eat, got there school haircuts, bookbags, and supplies, visited good ol dollar tree so they could spend there money that's been burning a whole in <propfemale>s pocket, and rented a movie for tonight if they ever decide they want to come in from outside  o and <propfemale> got the teacher she was hoping for, for her third grade year  busy day!"
here we go brownies here we go    woot woot! let's start this season off right 
"nate, the kids, and i went to look at a house yesterday, was super cute  but we have decided to be smart about things get our bills right, debts paid, and save for something that we know for sure we want and not rush into something just because its possible  it was a nice reality check though to what we have to work towards and look forward to  excited to say i think we are on the right track "
so my daughter (gabby) decided to put a <propfemale> in her mouth and then brooklynn hit her and she swallowed it!!! now i gotta make sure she passes the dang thing  things kids do sometimes   
bored! sitting at work waiting on this delivery  another day without an oven at home since it decided to blow up  hopefully someday the landlords will just get me one from this century! got brookes open house tonight at school  get to meet this teacher that she is excited she got  guess i'm a little excited for her too 
"so kids been up since about 4am, i'm extremely tired, and i got a <propmale> headache    the start of yet another beautiful day  i hope something goes my way today "
"bored! got my cleaning done, working on laundry  <propfemale> starts 3rd grade tomorrow and she's excited  did i mention that i'm bored? wish i could take a trip to new mexico in the blink of an eye  i would so go see my girl <propfemale> right now  she always makes me feel better  miss ya girl!"
well my baby is staying at grams tonight with her first day of school tomorrow  i'm glad she has a grandma to look after her and spend time with her like that  i guess i'm kinda missing her today  i know she has butterflies about tomorrow but i know she will do great  3rd grade here she comes!
im exhaused in every way possible today  physically struggling to keep my eyes open and mentally and emotionally drained  i am so ready for bed  on a better note <propfemale>'s 1st day of school seemed to go well  she really didn't tell me much but it was good lol  boy she hates when i ask her what she did at school lol  it's a mother thing i guess  i would love to be a fly on the wall and just take in her e playful erience 
this weather is awsome! bout to get <propfemale> from school and do some house cleaning and get dinner started  probably gonna sit and watch me some movies tonight  feeling pretty decent i actually got everyone off to school and stuff and made it to work before 9 o'clock this morning lol  if you only knew how much of an accomplishment that is     lol
just finished dinner  bout to go get wet in the rain watching <propfemale>'s soccer skills evaluation  then home for showers and a movie 
so bored and no <propfemale> to do the usual cleaning and cooking and all that good stuff  nate's already in bed for the night has to be at work at 3 in the morning working those 12's  love him to death for it but sometimes the loneliness kicks in and it drives me crazy  i'll get over it we gotta do what we gotta do and i'm glad he's loving his job and working so hard for the family 
"worst trip to subway ever! thought itd be nice to walk with my kids, my sister and mom to get some dinner and it turned into hell! gabby decided to cry and scream and kick and wine the entire time we were in the dang gas station! now <propfemale> decided she is gonna continue on the scream fest for the rest of the evening  yay me!"
waiting on pizza    really tired out today  chillin at the home front gonna watch a movie later  excited for a evening out with my hubby tomorrow @ our favorite place to eat carabba's and then hitting up the good old tinseltown 
"well finally had a good weekend to where i can say i wish it didn't have to end  me, the hubby and my sister and her man went out to eat at carrabba's in canton and then went to tinsletown to see takers  awsome movie! just got done studying brookes spelling words with her and now just sitting down and watching some football trying to get the kids to bed "
well my hubby is cooking dinner tonight (his idea!) and he got me a <propfemale> and a really nice card that he even wrote something in! its times like this i can't even begin to e playful ress how much i love this man  i hope this loveable side of him stays for awhile! i must say that i am enjoying it  i love you nate!
really tired but can't sleep  i'll reget it in the morning  i'm assuming my little miss gabby can't sleep either because its way way way past her bed time even on a night when she is up late tonight beats all nights because she is still up and watching a movie for the second time tonight and it's going on 1am  now i know i'm gonna really regret that lol!
trying to get motivated  not working so well       
been a really rough day on the nerves  so ready to lay it down and relax  i'm sure though the moment i do i will be sleeping  brooklynn's first soccer practice went well  she finally got a coach who is gonna teach her to play some real soccer doing drills and stuff at practice  none of this fish in the see tag stuff her past coaches would do at practice  i think its gonna be a good season for her 
"gotta a busy day today  work, store, errands with mom, well child check ups for ky and gab and then hopefully a relaxing night with some football  browns and buckeyes!"
cooking dinner for the fam and then a fun filled night of watching the new camp rock 2 movie with the kids and hubby and making some ice cream sundays!
bout to be leaving work and getting ready to head out to the zoo today  hopefully the rain goes away  i think its gonna be another good day!
"this week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but nevermet, or those we have held but could not take home   make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby  in memory    of all angels!?"
"absolutely loving the cooler weather today! ( i know, i know shut up! lol) in a mood today to possibly get some stuff accomplished around the house  lets hope that mood stays once i get off work and get there lol "
getting ready to go to laundry mat with kids o boy! this should be interesting! then <propfemale>'s soccer practice tonight 
well facebook its been real but i'm exhausted and need to get some zzzzz's 
"been yet another busy day  i've spent more time in my <propfirst> than at home this week  ran some errands and got my brake lights fixed (finally!) had a nice dinner with the kids, my mom, and my sister  now the exhaustion is kicking in  won't be long before i will be seeing the back of my eyelids lol "
my little man kyler is getting so big so fast  this last week i have seen him developing so much in his actions and ecspecially his vocabulary  its exciting and a little bitter sweet at the same time  he's talking in small sentences and saying all kinds of words and he's not even 2 till oct  1st  the last of my babies is gonna be a big boy before i know it   sad 
well time to hit the shower and get the day started  hopefully i can actually come home today for a little bit and get some of this housework done  been a long crazy week  ready to relax if possible  with the fair here i doubt relaxation is in the plans lol  lord knows my kids are gonna be on me about going lol 
"whoknows\me best? i bet nobody can answer all these questions \right  fullname:___________ age:________ birthday:___________ eye \color:_________nickname:___________ bestfriend:______________ \favoritecolor:___________ favorite food:________ copy & paste & \   see who knows you"
"think were gonna be headed down to the fairgrounds to sneak a peek at the animals tonight  tractor pull tomorrow night, kids rides sunday, and demo on thursday  all i can say is food, food, and more yummy food  lol!"
"well got a few hours of sleep and a new day is here again  yay! bad news day has started out like crap  good news i woke up and im here to e playful erience this bad day  gotta go to work for a bit, pick up <propfemale> from a slumber party, watch the osu game, and then off to the tractor pull for a few hours  hopefully with all that the day will turn out ok, but knowing me i'm not gonna hold my breath  lol!"
just finished watching letters to <propfemale> and actually loved it  for those of you who know my taste in movies i'm a horror kinda girl but this love story was cute as can be  if only all love stories could end as happy as this movies did       
i hate the weekends anymore  they bring me nothing but drama  but on the flip side my daughter did well at her soccer game today and i'm sitting with some piece and quiet watching some football  osu is kicking butt 
hoping the browns will take this win today  got alot to get done but we'll see how motivated i get to do it  not in the mood to clean and stuff so it might have to wait 
got my carpets steam cleaned finally  looks alot better but i'm sure it wont last but a week or two  ready for this weekend to be over  i'm bored and tired and got about half a headache started 
why is it that i get bored and i jump on facebook only to still be bored? can we say get a life? <propfemale> patten if you read this bring your butt back to ohio! this lonely feeling is getting really old  i need you! lol!

yesterday was such a busy crazy day and i am hoping that today will be a little less hectic and alot more relaxing  we'll see how long that hope lasts lol  got some cleaning to do after work but other than that i'm gonna attempt to chill out today and be lazy (if that's possible with 3 kids lol)  have a good day everyone!
brooklynn had an awsome soccer scrimmage last night against a boy team! they did so well trying to hold there own and it was very exciting to watch  over all not a bad day  hopefully today will only get better  now off here to get the kiddos ready for school

"bored, bored, bored! and don't forget lazy too! so what to do, what to do? think i'll go pick on nate for few! lol!"
getting ready to watch this movie (the e playful eriment) been wanting to see it for a little while now  hope it's a good one and i don't fall out half way through it lol 
the hardest part of letting go is the fear that you will be left behind 
oh how i wish i could go back to bed! it truly is calling me lol!

another lost soccer game today  i hope the girls can at least win one game this year  they've really come along pretty good together  now i need some energy i'm exhausted 
lots of bday cake this weekend! 3 bday parties down and i think we got a break now till december lol  finally sitting down and relaxing hoping this week has something good in store for me 
<propfemale>'s soccer practice was freezing! but all in all a good night  pretty tired wish the kids would fall asleep soon so i can relax 
i am so sick and there is no time for me to be sick  i sure hope this goes away as soon as it hit 
this cold is kicking my ass! i really need to get stuff done somehow  please go away!
"i saw you pass away  although i loved you dearly, i couldn't make you stay  your loving heart stopped beating, and put your tired hands at rest  god broke my heart to prove to me that he only takes the best  put this on your <propfemale> if there is someone in heaven that you miss everyday  rip <propmale>, <propmale>, grandpa giauque, grandma <propfirst>, <propmale>    i love you all and miss you so much "
"had a really good time shopping with my sister and dad yesterday  yes, i said shopping with my dad lol  hope to do it again sometime  just relaxing today gotta be up early in the morning for <propfemale>'s 9 am soccer game "
thought i was enjoying some quiet time untill gabby came out of her room covered from head to toe in red ink! quiet time is never a good thing in this house with three kids  it usually means someone is getting into something  i think her new outfit is ruined!
is really missing my husband and the closeness we used to have  it seems like life gets in the way more and more and there just isn't enough time in the day to focus on the special moments  i love you nate and no amount of time will ever take that away 
well been trying to find blue man group tickets all over the internet for nate for sweetest day but no luck   sad  this really sucks!
what to do for dinner    hmmmmm?
<propfirst> died this morning  don't know what's wrong with it but its not starting  yay! we cannot be without a vehical with all the running we do   sad 
well my sister and her boyfriend volunteered to watch my little ones all night tomorrow night so the hubby and i could spend a sweetest day together and go do something fun  thanks so much <propfemale> and <propfirst>! super excited  now i gotta get the <propfirst> running or we will be taxi-ing it lol! not gonna pass up an opportunity to spend some alone time with my baby 
i love your _______________? put this as your status and see what people say about you!! be nice!!  smile 
had the most amazing time w a special someone last night (my hubby)  we had a nice dinner & got our butts kicked in bowling (thanks to nate's lack of pin action lol)  everything went my way! got a table @ dinner furthest away from the tv's & nate misplaced his id so alcohol purcheses were @ my discrestion lol! i'm pretty sure he enjoyed himself just as much if not more though  thanks <propfemale> 4 babysitting  luv u both!
so the <propfirst> isn't working again! damnit! guess it has something more going on than what i had thought and hoped was fixed  now to figure out how to get it running 
getting ready to leave work and go see two of my favorite men   kyler and my hubby of course  hope everyone has a good day!
omg! today has been such a hectic crazy day  so much to do so little of me to do it  i am exhausted and still have so much left to do  i guess its gonna have to wait      i need to sit down for a few 
excited for <propfemale>'s last soccer practice tonight   parent child scrimmage! i gonna kick her butt tonight lol!
o what a week! i'm so ready for a break! feel like i don't even have time to breath sometimes 
"i may not be the most beautiful, or the sexiest, nor do i have the perfect body  i might not be everyone's first choice, but i'm a great choice  i don't pretend to be someone i'm not, because i'm good at being me  i might not be proud of some of the things i've done in the past, but i'm proud of who i am today  take me as i am or watch me as i walk away! post if you're proud of being you! ?"
happy thursday everyone!
getting bw3s for dinner with my sister   mmmmmm love them buffalitos! hubby's work got cancelled for tomorrow so the weekend gets to start a little early  sucks on the money end of things but spending the time together is what matters in the long run and i can't wait!
finally relaxing a little for the evening  <propfemale>'s last soccer game of the fall season tomorrow morning and then ordering the ppv ufc fights tomorrow night    can't wait!

"what an evening of sports! wooster, osu, and cavs! lets get these wins!"
thinking of you today <propmale>  i love you so so much and miss you like crazy! keep smiling in the sky for me   
"hope today is better than yesterday!!! i'm already feeling the stress and i haven't even made it home yet from work  gotta keep telling yourself \breath in    breath out    breath in     breath out!\"" ok i'm good lol  (for the moment)"""

finally sitting down for the night watching my cavs and waiting on my hubby to get home  ahhhh peace and quiet   
can't wait for this day to be over    been so irritable that i can't stand myself  ready for my man to get home and cuddle up in bed 
been a pretty productive day i must say    my house isn't the cleanest but if you knew me and i told you my laundry is almost caught up you would understand the progress i have made today lol!
"my husband has made me laugh, wiped my tears, hugged me tight watched me succeed, seen me fail, cheered me on, kept me going strong  my husband is a promise from god that i will have a friend forever  put this as your status if you love your husband!"
i can't wait for all the sickness to be gone  thanksgiving definitely took on a whole new meaning this year and the gathering of family gave each other the flu! sucks! one by one we are falling down    i hope the worst of it is over 
i am actually so excited for xmas this year! thanks to some amazing people helping out it's gonna be great! i think there will be some good suprises! let the countdown begin    i hate waiting to give gifts lol 
watching <propfirst> mouse clubhouse again! kyler is obsessed lol! it's only like the 15th time today!
is disgusted by this game  i love my cavs but really wanted to win this one  shit we didn't even bother to show up!
"i don't need an angel on my christmas tree, i already have a few in heaven looking down on me  post this as your status if there is someone in heaven you wish could be with you this christmas   love and miss you all!"
been a long boring day  anxious for xmas! who says you have to be little to be excited for <propfemale>?
got cookie dough in the fridge to make some cut outs but its pinch by pinch disappearing lol  i better get them made soon or there won't be any left for baking!
5 1 2 hrs later but the cut out cookies are finally done! yum yum!
"my back hurts so bad, i'm tired and i miss my husband  on a better note my gabby is gonna be 5 tomorrow!"
priorities        that's all i got to say  oh and i can't wait to see my kids on christmas! been working on a special suprise and i think they are gonna love it!
christmas finally over and the kids seemed to have an awsome one! the girls room looks great! now to get new years out of the way and then back to the norm  ready to eat some pork and sauerkraut!
"getting ready to watch the bachelor, eat some pork and kraut, and get my kiddos for bed so i can relax and wait up for my hubby "
oh-io!

got my baby his valentines gift a litttle early thanks to the help of my girl <propfirst> who said she'd watch my kiddos    twista we'll be seeing you soon!
"missing my ninja, he decided to make an e playful ensive point to the family to keep stuff out of his reach or he'll eat it whole! he had to have emergency surgery today to have underwear removed from his intestines! this <propmale> should be a pretty <propfemale>, but at least he should be ok now  puppies!!!"
missing my husband and our long nights of simple precious snuggling and playful arguing over who loves who more   
well got everyone settled down for the evening but it's not the same without my hubby here to hold me while i fall asleep  missing him like crazy tonight  i hate 12 hr shifts but thankful he has a dope job  guess a little facebook and <propfirst> mouse clubhouse will have to do till he gets home 
looks like valentines day is gonna be just another holiday ruined  when will i wake up   ?
