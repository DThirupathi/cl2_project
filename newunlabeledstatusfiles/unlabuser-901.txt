"â€œif i were asked to give what i consider the single most useful bit of advice for all humanity it would be this: e playful ect trouble as an inevitable part of life and when it comes, hold you head high, look it squarely in eye and say, 'i will be bigger than you  you cannot defeat me 'â€�"
"life is a compromise of what your ego wants to do, what e playful erience tells you to do, and what your nerves let you do  do the best you can, and be good to yourself so that you can above all be good to others!"
"a positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort "
"perhaps our eyes need to be washed by our tears once in a while, so that we can see life with a clearer view again â€�"
never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option!
"you can give all the gifts in the world to the one you have chosen, but the everlasting one will always remain the deed of a kind word"
any fool can know  the point is to understand 
"risk! risk anything! care no more for the opinion of others, for those voices  do the hardest thing on earth for you  act for yourself  face the truth "
"god <propmale> me the serenity to accept the people i cannot change, the courage to change the one i can, and the wisdom to know it's me "
"if you're not confused, you're not paying attention!!!"
"often people attempt to live their lives backwards; they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so they will be happier   the way it actually works is the reverse   you must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want "
what a beautiful morning!    first congrats to <propfemale> (so proud of you my love)! and than some birthday wishes to some of my favorite people!  start with <propfirst> happy birthday love!  than my sexy beasts!  fletch and <propmale> you know i love you two!  and than my favorite sister <propfemale>!!! happy birthday weekend all and congrats again <propfemale>!
i so enjoyed my beautiful morning and got the things done i needed too!!! now off to work and hopefully make some money this evening!!!
yay me!!! this is day three nicotine free!!!!!  i think i finally quit!!!!  just need to keep pushing i think after 3-5 days i'll be really good but today is super hard!
r i p  adyson   barely two and died by drowning!!! please say a prayer for the family they are in pain noone can imagine right now!!!
"<propmale> slaw, empty containers, straw wrappers and all   you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car! *shady*"
"it's odd that you can get so anesthetized by your own pain or your own problem that you don't quite fully share the hell of someone close to you  i remember when i was in such pain it made me angry, i am thankful that now i am a beautiful, strong, and loving woman!"
"to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting  it takes courage to grow up and become who you really are "
and again that anesthetizing feeling is coming back    just when i thought things were getting better! i will apologize now for not answering your phone calls or comments   i can feel my smile fading i hate this feeling yet again its just annoying   
i had a nice chat with a special girl after work today! it is exactly what i needed   someone with genuinity to listen without a biased judgement and i just wanted to say thank you!  you know who you are and as soon as i got home i kept my promise to you! thank you again   you made my heart smile with your compassion!
"women are like phones     we love to be held talked to, but if you press the wrong button you will be disconnected!!!"
"i hope everyone has a happy, safe, funtastic new years <propfemale>!  and a wonderful 2011!   smile "
"i know that you believe you understand what you think i said, but i'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant    sometimes i'm confused by what i think is really obvious  but what i think is really obvious obviously isn't obvious   "
choose very wisely whom you call upon to be your friends    your real friends    and don't ever take for granite a true person and a true friend that keeps their word through some of the toughest circumstances! you'll never understand my heart so you will never understand how very much it means to me!
"when things feel right, they usually are! you probably won't know it at the time, but <propfemale> really does come back to reward you   so if it feels right do it    it might hurt at the time but it will come back to make you smile    i am smiling right now!  smile "
flies spread disease!--- keep yours zipped!
smile  smile 
word that bitch mad that i took the spot    well bitch if you aint shittin then get off the pot!
"let men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart!  else it may be their miserable fortune, when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities, to be reproached even for the calm content, the marble image of happiness, which they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality ~the <propfemale> letter"
"~better to be poor and honest than to be dishonest and a fool ~\~the truth is such a rare thing, it is delightful to tell it ~"
alright pittsburgh steelers    mentally prepare    go for it    u can do it   
"the question for each man to settle is not what he would do if he had means, time, influence and educational advantages; the question is what he will do with the things he has  the moment a young man ceases to dream or to bemoan his lack of opportunities and resolutely looks his conditions in the face, and resolves to change them, he lays the corner-stone of a solid and honorable success ~hamilton wright mabie"
"all i can say about \forgetting <propfirst> mathers\""   is beautiful    beautiful irony   """
"cause bitches knew as soon as they saw me   it's never me they'll get the priveledge to know   i roll like a desperado, and i don't ever know where i'm gonna go    still i ball like there's no tomorrow    until it's over and it's all she wrote all she wrote all she wrote    until its over and it's all she wrote    forgetting <propfirst> mathers mmm i love some eminem   "
happy <propfirst>'s day world! now come to <propfemale> garden and spend your money    *that means tip your server!!!!*
"every morning i get up and look through the forbes list of the richest people in <propfemale>  if i'm not there, i go to work and school "
"ok people    listen up    i have never been so serious in my life   (and as we all know i am too serious!,anyway)holy shit eminem is performing at bonoroo this year    do you hear me    i have never wanted anything more in my life before now, than to go to bonoroo this year    i think i am having a heart attack!"

" love  the hardest thing you can do is smile when you are ill, in pain, or depressed  but this no-cost remedy is a necessary first half-step if you are to start on the road to recovery   love "
