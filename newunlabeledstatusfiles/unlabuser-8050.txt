is horrified by the ignorance of an alarming number of people and the fact that these people do not strive to gain knowledge or understanding   they only shut out or ridicule anything that they do not understand  the most frightening thing is that these people are influencing the younger generation to think this way and they will undoubtedly teach the generations after them  where does it end? when will it end?
