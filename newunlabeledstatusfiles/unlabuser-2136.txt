can't wait till finally get myself pretty for my birthday  my face itches from not shaving 
sitting at home bored  should he go out?
got my ass beat last night at work  thank god tonight is my last shift at applebee's!!  smile 
broken
i'm so in love and can't help to feel pain inside   i pray for strength   i pray to have him next to me 
just needs some reassurance that everything will be okay
i'm keeping the faith
i miss him so much   
i'll be strong for you
it felt so good holding him in my arms and feeling his lips against mine  i miss him   
there is something different about tonight
watched a scary movie and got scared sh**less for once
happy new years san <propmale>!!!
"so my phone is official a piece of shit  i need an upgrade desperately  birthday present anyone?\\last night was fun and to all the text i'm getting now about last night and the text i couldn't send, \happy new year to you too!\""\",2b59f0d9dae4db546f37b4d5c1f35214,coming undone
i just connected the merovingian  to bananas on wikipedia! geez my wikipedia game is so much fun when you're bored 
so my mind desperately tries to forget the memories my heart won't let go
better never to have met you in my dream than to wake and reach for hands that are not there 
once you kill a cow you have to make a burger
time will make you forget me but time will make me love you more than before 
"so picking up a pan that was in a preheated oven for 30 mins isn't always the smartest idea   my hand is killing me -_-,  reason # 58559 why <propmale> doesn't cook"
these are the days of our lives
i played pictonary with a blind girl
