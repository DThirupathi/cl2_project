"u say that i look lonely, well a good amount of things aren't as they appear  i'm fine in my quietness with one friend  and wats the point of saying that if u really dnt mean it, cuz the way u acted a few minutes later didn't back up what u first said  hmmm oh gee that's a surprise  take a hint ma'am "
"yeah so today rocked  celebrated a birthday at fun works  drove a go kart for the first time, along with a bumper car  yeah <propmale>'s gonna get it on tuesday  yeah just wait and see  haha  amazing day basically "
"so u wanna e playful lain to me, y ur hating me for something that i didn't do? learn to control ur jealousy and ur assumptions! gosh, i haven't done sh** to u and now ur choosing to be a pain again  dealing with u during summer was bad enough, i dnt wanna deal with u during school  gah!!!"
does anyone wanna help me out and cheer me up? haha  thanks for anyone who does    
"i hate the fact that i contradict things within myself   amazing    so history does repeat itself  i'm screwing myself up, just like i did back then  my heart consciousness unconsciousness aren't agreeing anymore  <propfemale> destroyed  great   freaking great   "
"so now i regret that decision  better hope this doesn't repeat again  if it does, dannabit too many repeats!!! glah!"
hey u guys wanna help me out  pray for my friend alright  he needs it   and i think i need it too   thanks 
"retreat=amazing&i'm glad i went some wounds were reopened&it reminded me of a time tht was difficult for me,i thank the ppl that caused this for showin up cuz they helped that wound open so tht it could b healed  my heart broke in a day and was healed that night  i'm grateful for tht  although the 3 i thanked didn't kno wat i was thanking them for, they accepted it&thank you core i love you guys"
i lost it and then got it back  well slightly haha  amazing  eh hopes it's not that bad 
"today was alright, but i still wanna relive saturday that was amazing for some reason "
i like talking to some people a lot i guess  they can make me happy but i get impatient waiting for them to reply  just throwing it out there haha
"i need to man up haha  i learned how i can be easily thrown around today, well i got reminded just by someone stronger than the other dude i went against "
"i'm still getting impatient waiting for ppl to reply, but i just kinda wish the person that brought me alotta joy wouldn't make me feel anxious without trying "
"impatient, anxious, and yeah    i hate how people don't know how they can make me feel without them even doing anything "
"so today we're cleaning, dad's playing his christmas music, and we're getting ready for christmas    yesterday i can honestly say was still the worst thanksgiving ever for me, but again good things were i saw ninja assassine(i liked it) spent some time with my nieces and nephews, and had like 3 lil kids chasing after me trying to tickle me? haha i guess those were the only good things?"
"dang   it's not broken, just becoming slightly cracked   gah  i really don't like anxiety, or disappointment  thanks for doing that to me dude, unintentional as it may be, i still don't like you because of it  hating this    great  blah!"
i don't wanna be here anymore   i'm tired of anxiety   this sucks    
"so i feel stupid now=great(sarcasm), my eyes kinda hurt, and i still hate anxiety  i think i really gotta end this now "
gaaaaaaah   finals    nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! *hides under a rock in a cave behind a waterfall in a <propmale> in a state in a country in a continent in a planet in a galaxy*
"i was grateful to forget about you for a minute(more like hours) but now everythings coming back, and i feel like throwing a tantrum when things don't go the way i planned "
this is an impatience  i want a gap to open before me escaping time so i can stay in there as long as i like  i wanna go to the mountains   
1 3 10 r i p  <propfemale> garcia   pray for her please

"ingredients to become a unicorn: gel, hairspray,string, a clip, 2 bobbypins, a rubberband  2 lollipop sticks, and toothpaste   warning: how u unbecome a unicorn is ur choice!!!"
"so i'm losing my voice, and i got 2 presentations tomorrow  great right? but besides that spending time with <propfemale> was pretty darn fun!!!"
"so here i am again, asking you to pray to give my friend a miracle, so that he will want to stay  within these next two days, i ask anyone who reads this to pray for my friend <propfirst>  to make the right decision "
"dnt u hate it <propfemale> there r certain ppl that u want to care about u, bt they really dnt care? *sigh* oh well "
i hate repeats in life! anyone wana give me an e playful lanation for repeated situations bt with different ppl?

i feel stupid   gah wonderful 
i'm tiiiired  too much sun makes me want to take a nap  decent day though 
thanks life for being such a <propfirst> a**  gah
why is it i have a tendency to ruin my peace of mind??  annoyed 
"well i started reading captivating today, yeah it made me feel like a girl haha"
"wooow, ur such a freaking jerk  ugh"
"i think god is sending me a message, and it's something i didn't wanna do  dang it!!!"
"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear    while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your woman cry there's a man stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence"
accepting the unproven fact would be better than e playful ecting the less likely answer  =[
let's see how today goes shall we? i hope it goes better than the past few days  good morning to anyone reading this by the way 
what's the point of having to deal with stupid people?!
"honestly, if this is how it's going to be, then i don't really want this   annoyed "
"well i'm stuck here, and i'm feeling kinda stupid for letting that show   there may not be any comfort, and i don't like that i possibly started confrontation    fuuuuudge "
"im alright i guess, just tired  im thinking too much about nothing "
"going out with the parents? today's been pretty calm  friends got me thinking bout stuff left and right since yesterday though  my choice is the only one that counts though i guess  great, serious talk needed once we get back to school??? i believe so "
honestly i wish i could finally give up on this  because i don't see the point in this staying around when it's causing me more annoyance instead of joy   annoyed  well good night 
well today sucked really bad and not because it's the end of school  i'm in a fml kinda mood  great  anyone make me smile please?
