"i have learned that generosity will make you <propmale> !! the best thing to do if you're feeling poor is to give something away  give a few dollars to a homeless person, some clothes to a thrift store or pay for the person behind you at the drive through  instead of focusing on what you don't have, focus on what you do have and how you can bless others with it  being able to give is a divine gift in itself !!! amen !"
