"take me by the hand\take me somewhere new\i don't know who you are\but i'm, i'm with you, oh\i'm with you\i'm with you"
"chill out, what you yellin' for?\lay back, it's all been done before\and if, you could only let it be\you will see\i like, you the way you are\when we're drivin' in your car\and you're, talkin' to me one on one\but you become\somebody else\'round everyone else\your watchin' your back\like you can't relax\you tryin' to be cool\you look like a fool to me"
i win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"to everyone who is starting school tomorrow morning like me: have a good day!!  laugh  and if i will be seeing you   please please do not touch me! i do not want millions of hugs every five seconds  it's annoying, so to avoid all (well almost all) annoyances that day just don't attempt to touch me  laugh  thanks!!"
had a pretty good day today  not like i e playful ected which is always a plus!  laugh  it felt weird for a few classes that <propfemale> wasn't there but after a while it was fine  smile  the only bummer is that i don't get to see <propfemale> all day  annoyed  only in the morning  but in place of her i have <propmale> in half my classes and he makes my day  laugh  lol
well i have to walk to school  ug  i can't find my necklace that i wear everyday!!! which is going to bug me and i'll probably think about 'where did i put it?' all day today  i feel naked without it  annoyed  oh well i get to look for it later  (hint to mom and <propfemale> if you find it let me know when i get home  thanks  smile  )
day two down  i don't have to worry about not knowing my combo cause i already have it memorized (which is super!) the only thing now is to get my classes in order  so far it's not too hard  now i just have to hold my breath and wait for the school year to end

my blood is itchy!!!
this side up

"'give me your lunch money weaver ' \'i'm afraid i just can't do that, i'm not too sure you'll spend it on milk '"
"i'm tuggin' at my hair\i'm pullin' at my clothes\i'm tryin' to keep my cool\i know it shows\\i'm staring at my feet\my cheeks are turning red\and i'm searching for the words inside my head\\'cause i'm feeling nervous\tryin' to be so perfect\'cause i know you're worth it, you're worth it\yeah   "
new hair cut  laugh  i still don't like getting up and realizing that this early i have to walk to school   ug  i'm going down another pant size  not good!!!
"i am outside, and i've been waiting for the sun, and with my wide eyes i've seen worlds that don't belong  my mouth is dry, with words i cannot verbalize  tell me why we live like this  keep me safe inside, your arms like towers, tower over me, yeah  'cause we are broken, what must we do to restore our innocence and oh, the promise we adored?"
i love superchicÃ¤kÃ±  smile  love 
"and we're back to 'it's friday!' which means very soon it'll be 'ug, monday' but the weekend should be fun  smile  saturday will be my first lesson with the drums! (as long as no one 'forgets' or anything)"

"well  my day was ended with a bunch of sluts  whooohhh!! now i'm really excited for our school because you all know how to dance like a bunch of whores!!!! not  sigh   thats why i never went to those pep assemblies, it's all so clear  maybe too clear now "

my mind is slowly slipping   
"go ahead and burn it down\\i'm drunk and so is everyone else \\in this devil town\\they won't let me turn around\\to get one last look at my baby \\while she's still around \\while she's still around \\while she's still around \\while she's still around \\go ahead and build it up again this city's just cemeteries and forgotten men\\my only hope's to see you \\and even if i never do \\while she's still around \\~30h!3"

"i freaking hate the computer!!!!! i typed everything the way i wanted to the first time and now it's gone, i can't even think about it now!"
"no one sits with him, he doesnâ€™t fit in,\\but we feel like we do when we make fun of him,\\'cause you want to belong, do you go along?\\'cause his pain is the price paid for you to belong\\itâ€™s not like you hate him or want him to die,\\but maybe he goes home and thinks suicide,\\or he comes back to school with a gun at his side,\\any kindness from you might have saved his life   "
"no, that is not me "
"now get yo drum on\getcha, getcha drum on"

"staying home, having nightmeres, watching animal cops and teen mom while ignoring my lovely foot pain  it's not a really fun time "
"so much my brain wants to do but all my body wants to do is sleep, probably cause i really need it "
"definition of dream: a series of thoughts, images, and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep "

mid-night shower!
blah blah blah blah blah blah                           blah!

things are shaping up to be pretty odd   
"head under water and they tell me\to breathe easy for awhile\the breathing gets harder even i know that"
"due to the fact that my brain isn't retaining anymore new information, i cannot take anymore tests or do anymore homework  i wish that was an excuse that would work  too bad only the first part is true  i'm so complicating!"
"watch your mouth because your speech is slurred enough\that you just might swallow your tongue\-p a t d "
it makes sense if you don't think about it  
going to try and make this a good day!  laugh 
today wasn't too bad  smile  could get better though 
thinking about that offer of home schooling  the pros and cons are pretty even though  i need some fun time this weekend! anyone care to help?
i'm trying to let you hear me as i am  
finally! it's friday!
i am one to suffer in silence  
"watched scrubs today, haha  smile  then i did my homework while zombies ate some flesh  it was a pretty interesting day "
i hope tonight will be dreamless!
i can't feel my legs!
i need to find that place where it's just me and you once again
