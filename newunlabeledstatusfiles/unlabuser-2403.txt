"what is life without conflict? how would you learn whats wrong without pain? i fight for a life that i can be proud of  is that worth anything to others? dout it but it means the world to me and i will give my last breath if it means i am able to see one moment of my dream  i will not fall now, i will not falter, i will overcome and i will transcend all the pain  i will be reborn again someday "
yay went food shopping  i dont know how i lived for two weeks without food 
"had a good time hanging out with friends today, all is going well and i hope for it to continue to get better "
i feel old looking at some of the songs i like or bands iv seen in concert    
for once in like 2 weeks im going to be alone for the rest of the night  its kinda refreshing and depressing at the same time  and i have no work tomorrow  well i guess its a movie marathon then     wish i had some new movies lol

well got back from a 2 hour long walk with my husky ( love him to death ) next on the list of things to do??? damn food       had so much fun with him forgot to eat today lol
have you ever said something that you regreted at the time and found out it opened a door to a new begining that you thought was never possible? well i felt that today it really did open a door to what i thought was failure  maybe i should take more chances? i feel more at peace with what i have done in life then ever for all my life 
"why do i keep the beast at bay we both want the same thing but in a different forms  is it because i feel like if i was that person it wouldnt be me but just a knock off of most men  i choose to be a real man in my eyes and defend those that need it, to be a gentlemen and help women in times of need and be a good friend when they need it  but i feel like my life is filled with a dark loneliness "
well time to go out and find some stuff to do     maybe go see big boy again   smile 
had a fun time with     the fluff   smile 
well i guess all good things must end my $1500 laptop is on the <propmale>  this sucks that means i can try to get it fixed or get a new one      hard choice if i got a new one it would be alot of money

"your eyes no longer see, life's reality \\push the needle in, face death's sickly grin \holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin \\head starts spinning round, you fall down to the ground \feel your body heave, death's hands starts to weave \\it's too late to turn, you don't want to learn \price of life you cry, now you're gonna die!"

"have you seen the power of the human heart at its greatest? i will know i have felt that way once, but for now i think its a dark loneliness i feel now and the urge to learn to understand all around me "
"my life has bin filled with its ups and downs its pains and pleasures  i wish for a time that is of happiness and a feeling of greatness as i try to atone for past problems i cant but help to feel that they will come back to haunt me  i will always be running from what i am and never find a happy thought that isnt followed by remorse  the love i gave was never enough, will it ever be for another?"
what a day i feel like going for a long and relaxing walk but i feel like i dont want to do that in a town city environment i want to walk in the woods maybe and relax and be at peace  but i dont have the means to get to the woods i want to walk in atm   sad 
what is on my mind?
i have lived my life in fear of how others react to what i say or do but i feel like sometimes what i say or do defines me but then if i hold back so i dont scare or upset people then what am i really? were do i fit am i like all the other people in this world or is it true that everone is unique then why do i see alot of people that look or are the same mindless drones i think i like being unique

"well it looks like logic is out the window when people think of things now days    really smarten up people  try to use some part of your brain when making decisions  did you know that there is a 46% <propmale> of divorce in the united states, so really dont fall in love because they give you things or look good try seeing if there is even a real connection and then build from there trust is needed "

fuck you mad moxxi its not fair to make it so i have no shields and its the fucking badass wave that like trying to pole volt without a pole you cant do it  and it doesnt help that all the enemys are my level with buffs     i swear if there is at any point a <propmale> to kill you i will    
thinking of doing something today  but it looks like the sky is going to be my biggest opponent  well maybe something will find me then 
woot its a nice day out wonder what i should do? i think im going to see my child    lol
well im kinda happy with the alone time i have right now 
"i noticed that life can be as short as a second for some and as long as one hundred years for others, iv seen people struggling to meet a goal without any reassurance of success, iv seen other people continue the same old routine because they think its best and that there is nothing better even tho they are suffering from what they perpetuate  my conclusion we are a lost cause"
well the empty hole in today that bordom is filling needs something else im going out to find it     so long gay boys  
well i have bin playing a modded d2 for about two days now and i have to say they did a good job and its really fun     and hard  smile 
woot home made cookies  yum still warm too   smile 
"well if all gos as planed i will be a master electrician, but it will take time  woot one of my grand goals will be compleat soon   smile "
the pursuit of happiness can be a long and lonely road but its worth it if you can stay the course and over come all the hurt because you will find someone that finds you perfect in a imperfect world and will treasure every waking moment they spend with you  good luck to all those that are in search of love 
fucking heat is a killer!!!
"i feel good today kinda liked the alone time, was able to regain my inteligence after all the awful stuff i watched last night  thank you <propmale> asdrubal pozo maybe the second time watching the guy being burned alive was not the greatest thing to see late at night "
i feel like becoming an urban ninja getting ninja darts and when someone j walks throw one at the telephone pole with a note saying  ( use the crosswalks or the next time im aiming for you! signed urban ninja )
i have a really awful headache i feel sick too  wtf i never get sick    
well simply put i am going to e playful lode with awesome happiness   smile 
false happiness replaced with real sadness  i kinda wanna sleep even tho its way to early   
real sadness turned into unrelenting anger for all those that never heed my words and continue down the path of suffering that they inflict upon themselves with thoughts of false happiness  smarten up people if your life sucks dont complain then continue doing the same thing  change things for the better!
well feeling better now had good food and good conversations wish life was like this all the time but it isnt   sad 
i feel extremely bord with my life  i think im going to see my child to cheer me up

well my opponents did a poor job at stopping me in homefront     poor bastards 36 people fell to me and only got me 5 times    
"my eyes no longer see the world as it once was, i cant be blinded by false happiness  i know what i want and damn all those that stand in my way i will conquer any challenge, overcome any obstacle and if needs be die for my own cause "
