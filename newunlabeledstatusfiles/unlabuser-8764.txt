my mind spirals out of control like <propfemale>'s tornando taking me away  my thoughts are my dreams  my words my reality  e playful ressed through the outlet of a pen  creating my beautiful mightmare
i dream of the day you look into me instead of through me 
"calm midnight skies captivate starlit eyes as the soul basks in the moonlights rise  the mind wonders to and fro, no destination, nowhere to go  while thougths swim like gypsys in the sea ,creating kaliedoscopic visions of being free"
"let me stare into your soul with the gentle touch of a lovers eyes let me caress your skin with warm breaths of parting lips  let me fill your heart with passionate sighs, and hold your heart with desires fingertips"
"love is my <propfemale>, happiness my disguise  my heart races and pounds yearning for what cannot be found  leading  to its demise"
"show me yours, ill show you mine  let our hearts embrace and souls entwine, loses each other in each other for the rest of time  and let our thoughts combine as our worlds collide"

"the self inflicted wounds to my heart and soul bleed through the oracls that have witnessed all i have caused  causing streams of my pain to flow freely  instantly drowning me in a sea of broken memories, my ony savior is a torniquit in the form of sin "
florida bound!
thanks everbody! and happy valentines day to all
im sorry for who i am  for what you created  the monster you loved  the man that you hated
"trees sway as the gentle breeze calls my name  the stars guide my way through the darkness, taking me away from the pain  i close my eyes, spread my wings, and fly away form a world that doesnt care  the brigth <propfemale> fillsmy lonely heart with visions of happiness  i wish i could stay, that i didnt have to leave  but i mus treturn  to my empty life until i can again escape in my dreams"
"he sits in the corner his life in his hands, the stars in his eyes, the world spirals around him, as the candles burn  tunnel vision sits in and all he can see all the unanswered questions  why? his heart bursts with tears, as the stars fade, maybe one day he will find the answers, maybe one day he will find his way"
"calm midnight skies captivate starlit eyes, asthe souls basks in the moonlights rise, the mind wonders to and fro, no destination, no where to go, while thoughts swim like gypsies in the sea, creating kalidescopic visions of being free"
"my heart pounds telling me she is the one, for me to let go  my mind whispers hold back, give it time, take it slow  both are tired of the tears caused by the lonlinessand the pain, and long for the love we hope will be gained  what do i do, to which do i follow? i will do both, take it slow and let her know  that i am willing to be here until the end, and i hope for the day that she is more than a friend"
"i am with you everyday, but i am never really there  like the morning mist of a sprong day, you catch a glimpse, then i fade away  i know your dreams and goals, your deepest secrets, your biggest fears  i come to you in your dreams, but i am never really there  who am i? i am you and you are me  we are one in the same  but i am never really there "
"sweat rolls down glistening in the light, the candles shade your body like an artists sketch, hair layed out like strainds of gold, eyes closed, lips parted letting out sighs of ecstasy, my heart skips a beat, breath taken by the beauty before me  soft touch of a <propfemale>, gentle gaze of a lover, passion ignites, entwining our body and souls, as love blooms in the shadows dancing on the wall"
"my mind spirals out of control, like <propfemale>'s tornado it takes me from home, my thoughts are my dreams, my words my reality, e playful ressed thrrough the outlet of a pen, creating my beautiful nightmare"
i dream of the day you look into me instead of through me  and see me for the man i am today instead of the boy i was yesterday
"i'm lost with nowhere to go  on this lonely road i walk alone  my soul screams but nobody hears  my heart bleeds drowning me in tears  the weight on my shoulders, i <propfemale> alone  crying inside so nobody will know  afraid to let people see, the man that is really me "
how many times have i looked in the mirror at the broken reflection of a man who isnt there
