words for tonight: calm down!
wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are
never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option
"\to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\""\",4f05cfd6cda481d86cdedd1bdad02fd7,"if you can't convince them, confuse them"
~*~be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind~*~
i would love to put my hands around ur neck    just to know what it feels like!
you ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry
oh lawd my mom said those dreaded words to me yesterday: i want a facebook!
you need to keep a helmet on that kid!
great night for a bonfire!

onstar is awesome  smile

"\the most wasted of all days is one without laughter \"" e  e  cummings"""
open house for the chickasaw co  regional correctional facility @ 10 smile 0 am today    open to the public   come and tour the facility!
things aren't always what they seem
holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned
question of the day: why worry about things that are beyond your control?
saved by the weekend!
had a great weekend  hopefully this week will be better than last week!
laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live  love 
those who anger u control u
is so excited right now!

"life is change  growth is optional  choose\wisely "
god will never give you more than you can handle
"god, <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference "
"god didn't promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, but he did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the way "
all people have the right to stupidity but some abuse the privilege 
don't be all up in my kool-aid when you don't know what flavor it is   
gahlee   is it friday yet?
\do what you feel in your heart to be right ~ for you'll be criticized anyway  you'll be damned if you do," and damned if you don't \"" \"4f05cfd6cda481d86cdedd1bdad02fd7,\it's not the load that breaks you down," it's the way you carry it \"" \"4f05cfd6cda481d86cdedd1bdad02fd7,"\be yourself; everyone else is taken \""~*~oscar wilde~*~"""
finally! a much needed date night  smile 
"sharpen up your teeth\your dreams are more than worth defending\in a fight that's never ending\go on, go ahead and prove me wrong"
the man who smiles when things go wrong has thought of someone to blame it on
~*~some people come into our lives & leave footprints on our hearts  others come into our lives & make us wanna leave footprints on their face~*~
"by three methods we may learn wisdom: first, by reflection, which is the noblest; second, by imitation, which is the easiest; and third, by e playful erience, which is the most bitter "
\a good character is the best tombstone  those who loved you and were helped by you will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered  ~*~carve your name on hearts, not on marble ~*~â€�\4f05cfd6cda481d86cdedd1bdad02fd7,snow again       
"a wise man never knows all, only fools know everything"
maybe someday i'll be just like you and step on people like you do
he who is not very strong in memory should not meddle with lying
