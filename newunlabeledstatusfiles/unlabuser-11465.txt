"thank you for all the bday wishes, i'm trying to respond to all of ya and i will succeed    just not right at this instant  playful "
well that was one very successful bday  thank you all who made it out  you guys certainly made it great 
racquetball makes me happy  smile 
i forgot how bad anchorman is
today is gonna be a good day
love the complete silence and stillness that only winter snow brings
i <propfemale> to find that area where truth and belief overlap
today was full of those nostalgia moments; pangs to live those moments again 
it is waaaay too cold out today  i don't think i'd survive in a colder climate
i'm thinking a change of scenery is definitely in order  mountains anyone?
you are that which you dare to be
"aight universe, lets see how else you can make this day one for the record books  i dare ya "
"aight body, here's the game plan  while i'm sleeping you're gonna kick this cold's ass and i'm gonna feel better tomorrow  okay? and     break!"
"coffee at 9pm might have been a mistake  well, guess i'll get caught up on one of the three books i've been meaning to get back into "
"courtney: do you like jÃ¤ger or <propfemale> better?\jake: yes "
pretty sure i pinched a nerve in my back  this is rather unpleasant
wallet found  now off for fun and a bike ride to get my head out of this funk 
i truly do love driving in the snow  fun times all around   smile 
great weekend ahead!
awesome sundays are my favorite   smile 
all i have to say is ow 
time for a science e playful eriment  how much caffeine does it take <propfirst> to make it through a work day and going to see some awesome bands at the beachland tonight? we're at a pot of coffee and a mtn dew and counting   maybe some red bull is in order?
show at the beachland was awesome  have some of the best friends ever  smile 
today is gonna be a looooong day
"well, i almost died, but got some amazing pictures in the metroparks"
so raise your glass
so  incredibly  tired 
thanks for dying internet  guess that's my cue
"my mom: doesn't matter, when it comes up you get it all done, whether you're ready or not \\twss?"
"there may be a lot of things to think about, but absolutely nothing to worry about"
well inaugural podcast recording i think was definitely a success  hopefully everyone else enjoys as much as we did making it 
"time for some only child fun  staying in, watching some movies, playing some video games, and editing a podcast  nice to have a day of absolutely nothing  smile "
"for all those potential business owners out there, here's a <propfemale> rule: do not waste your employees time "
so very much want to go home
snow is fun  fun in that slow soul killing type of way   
the high road is the better road right?
"how bout we not lose power again, k?"
