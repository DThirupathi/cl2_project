i'm stuck in altus for another year so i may as well make the best of it  that means get a better job meet new people and try to be as happy as possible and if nothing else i still have my family
had a really good day  slowly weeding out the negative influences in my life and bringing some positive ones back into it  already i'm feeling more at peace with myself 
finally pulled myself back together  now i just need to see my grandparents and i will be happy with myself again 
sometimes i wish i could make things work out but i know it's for the best  i hate being misled and lied too so it's better off this way

country music is the devil 
i really dont know how you can look at yourself in the mirror and lay your head down at night  people like you make me sick
