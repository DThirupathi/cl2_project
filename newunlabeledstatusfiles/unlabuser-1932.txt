why is he always right even when he dosn't want to be 
why is life hard? why are people confusing? why do i have no power? why don't they trust me? why do i ache? why can't things just go back to the way they were before my world turned upside down? why can't i be normal? for a moment i would love to be normal  being me just dosn't seem good enough anymore
