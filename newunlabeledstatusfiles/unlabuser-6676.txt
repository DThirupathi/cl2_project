you know you're a nerd when you can quote the sorting hat from memory 
"twilight drinking challenge: \step 1) get a bottle of your favorite beverage\step 2) watch twilight"
"rules: \#1) every time <propfemale> has a stroke face or twitches oddly take a drink\#2) every time <propfirst> does something creepy take a drink (e playful ressions, words, actions)\#3) if someone misses a drink it is up to the others playing to inform them\#4) -<propfemale>- being creepy or -<propfirst>- twitching does not count\#5) other characters being either creepy or twitching does not count"
"enjoy and beware, i'm doing this challenge now with dr  pepper and i am oding on caffeine and being all giggly and slightly sick  only about halfway through the movie, only halfway through a two liter  good luck "
"if anyone e playful ects me at school tomorrow, give up hope  i'm iced in "
"you and i wake up in jail together  using only 4 words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well  be a good sport and play along   and 4 words is hard to come up with "
when you breathe kittens have carbon monoxide induced heart attacks that make them stand out in the rain to drown themselves like turkeys 
"i have an infestation of car dragons     they make your car do those funny sounds that have nothing to do with anything, usually a slight rattling noise in your air vents  they feed off the crumbs of forgotten <propfemale> bars and snacks and can be quite annoying  also, i've discovered that i do not enjoy it when my toilet paper says hi to me "
-is dancing crazily- eighteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen!!  laugh
