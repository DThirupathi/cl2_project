"you learn to like someone when you find out what makes \                      them laugh, \\                      but you can never truly love someone until you find out \                      what makes them cry "
when it rains it most definitely pours     
deep breaths      no throwing of inanimate objects        or people

i have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad  or i can go mad by ricocheting in between 
"i am inhabited by a cry \nightly it flaps out\looking, with its hooks, for something to love \i am terrified by this dark thing\that sleeps in me;\all day i feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity "
the holidays seem to have a way of making my melancholy existence even more incompetent      i just wonder if there is a way to make it back to everything 
had a good weekend   and hopes of many more 
"â€œuncertainty and mystery are energies of life  don't let them scare you unduly, for they keep boredom at bay and spark creativity â€�"
"â€œmy recipe for dealing with anger and frustration: set the kitchen timer for twenty minutes, cry, rant, and rave, and at the sound of the <propfemale>, simmer down and go about business as usualâ€�"
