i am so confused   
<propmale> keele is very glad to have popsicles back in his life 
today <propmale> keele learns that cold sushi and cold cereal do not go well together 
i've been in the internet so long that i feel like i've traveled to the future 
"ah, road trips  hours and hours in the car with your dad and cheap beef jerky "
"ah, \toast 'em popups \"" the breakfast of champions """
i've got a clan of gingerbread men!
"finally, i have internet!"
"the perfect opportunity for wit will pass me by, as i'm too tired to be witty   darn "
bought two movies and five red hot chili peppers cds from amazon  i'm gonna be checking my mailbox ten times a day until they come 
"memo to myself: do the dumb things i gotta do, touch the puppet head "
