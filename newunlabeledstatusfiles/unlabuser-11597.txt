"i would like to find an apartment that is relatively cheap, yet big enough for aidan to have some room to play around in   hopefully in a \nice\"" part of town   there has got to be something out there   right?"""
i just want to thank everyone who tried to help me with finding an apartment!!  thanks!  i actually found one today in pownal and put a down payment on it   should be in by next weekend   $695 with all utilities incl   i don't think i could've found any d
just stopping in to sayhello!  it's been some time now    i hope all is well with everyone and i hope to be talking to you more often    soon

i want to wish everyone a <propfemale> christmas and a very safe holiday season!!  i hope all is well with you and your families   spread lots of smiles!!
"getting ready to bust out some p90x   i really enjoy this routine, it's a lot better than i was giving it credit for   if anyone gets the <propmale> to try it out for a month or so, give it a shot, it's almost addictive   can't wait for the end of <propfirst>  to get here so i can compare the b4 and after photos!"
"had a great weekend with aidan, finally finished xmas with him, <propmale> and <propfemale>   we all went sledding on what was left of the snow at <propfemale> park     it was fun to see them play like that   thank you <propfemale> for taking pictures, i hope to see some soon "
"my boy, aidan is starting to potty on the potty!  very exciting   he's growing up so fast   i love everything new that he comes up with    words (no bad ones thankfully), facial e playful ressions and the way he loves to laugh   he makes his daddy very happy!! i couldn't ask for a better son!!"
must be my son  laugh 
"just started back on 3rd shift    i worked it before, it sucked then too!!  i hate trying to find a new sleep schedule "
finally finished the 1st 90 days of p90x workout   i already like my results!  i can definitly see improvements on areas i was hoping to improve on  like that 6 pack that i had stored away in the cooler all winter  smile   i just need to take the after photos so i can compare the old and new   if anyone has ever wanted to try this program out    go for it!! i loved it and cant wait for the next routine to begin!
loved that i was able to sleep all day long!!  8 to 8!  i so needed some sleep   3rd shift has been robbing me of time for myself 
finally going to get my pathfinder fixed!!!!  i have missed my truck    missed the 4wheel drive is more like it   hopefully i have it before the 10th 
i hope that everyone is doing alright and that your lives are filled with happiness of family and friends   take car of yourselves

"<propfirst> baker is doing fine   he's a little scuffed up, pretty even on both sides, possibly a broken nose   he is under great care in the albany surgical icu   luckily <propfirst> is sleeping some of the pain off right now   <propfirst>s family is staying with him and appreciates everyones prayers   i was with <propfirst> just a couple of hours ago and e playful ect him to be back to '<propfirst>' in no time "
may need knee surgery   find out in a couple of days 
"would like to thank everyone for the support, prayers and concerns with <propfirst> baker   i was with him last night and talked to him for a while   of course he didn't talk back (a first - if you know <propfirst>)  he is in a medically induced coma to help him rest and to try to speed up the healing process "
the doctors need to wait onther 5-10 days to see if the brain swelling eases down and any bleeding slows   they need his levels and pressures to plain out before they can do anything for his left leg - which needs attention- and before they can see where the bleeding comes from in his brain 
he has lots of family and friends always with him and talking to him   i don't see any reason for him not to make a full recovery!!  it's going to take time and <propfemale>   thank god <propfirst> has that -time!  lots of other people aren't so lucky 
"i also heard today from his fiancee, <propfemale>, that hed did open both eyes momentarily and did move some of his right side   good news!!  3 am this morning he closed each hand around his mothers hand and the fingers of another friend (<propfirst> bedor)   i hope to hear more good news tomorrow when i stop to see him   i wish he would flip me off just so i know he knows it's me there   it's like our 'hello' to eachother  smile "
any news i find out or signs from him i see will be posted as soon as i get back home   thank you again for all thoughts and prayers!!!!
"i just want to say: if you hear any new info from anyone, unless they have been there with him or talked to his mom or dad or sisters, don't believe it all   i've heard so much crap!!  please try to keep the storytelling down   some stories have gotten back to the family and is upsetting what some people assume happened   it's never a pleasant thing to hear that people think your son brother fiancee dad is dead!!"
"if anyone has questions or thoughts for the family or myself, write me and i'll deliver messages and answer any quetions i know the answers to   thank you "
"about <propfirst> baker: i saw him again today with another friend of ours, <propfirst> galenus, and <propfirst> looked a bit better, color wise   his pressures and other levels are doing fine   he is still in the induced coma, the less brain activity the better right now   then hopefuly the sooner the doctors will be able to take care of the injuries on his leg   he won't be losing it anytime soon "
"more and more people voice concern for <propfirst> and i want to let everyone know how much it is appreciated!!  <propfirst> is a fighter and i know he can make it through this rough road he about to travel   especially with all of the support from you and his family   nothing else is new that i know of   i hope for further progress everyday, and will let you know anything i find out "
"please keep the kind thoughts, prayers and comments coming   i tell <propfirst> everything you guys say   i'm sure he would let you all know that he his grateful for your concern, as i am "
"can't wait for my son and his mom and her family to get back from their trip to england   been gone for a week and i miss my boy!!  i really need to see him, hold him and give him a thousand kisses   i hope they all had a great time and good wether   i pray for a safe plane ride and car ride home   daddy loves you aidan!!  c u soon"
"i'm so very happy that aidan, <propfemale> and the goldsmiths are home and that they all had a safe trip   from the pictures i've seen, it looks as though they all had a great time visiting family and friends   can't wait to see more pics   welcome back   i missed picking aidan up and squeezing him and giving him kisses "
about <propfirst> baker:  i just heard from <propfemale> (his fiancee) that <propfirst> no longer has the tube in his head to relieve the pressure on his brain and that the doctors wee able to perform surgery on his left knee   he came out of surgery fine   he may need some skin graphs done in that area that i know of 
"<propfirst> is now on half of the medication that he was on to keep him sleeping   he will still need to rest for the next couple of days, but i'm hoping that by this weekend he may know who is visiting and that he has lots of family and friends there to help him   thank god that the news just keeps getting better!!  we love you <propfirst> "
<propfirst> baker is getting better everyday   he is still relaxing and trying to heal as much as possible before getting up and about   it sure would be nice to see him around the house again and hanging out at the laudry mat with his family   they all have been so strong and great through this whole thing   <propfirst> is a very lucky man to have such incredible support around him 
why don't you talk to someone who gives a s*h*i*t about what you have to say     a little clue for you     it's not me!!  have a nice day  : )
"i can't wait to have aidan this weekend, it's supposed to be really nice out   maybe we could head over to the lake for a while and have a small picnic, go swimming and get some more photos of my little man   don't worry, he'll have plenty of sun screen on  smile "
all i want is a great crazy night of fun with great friends and loud!!! music!!  all are welcome to join us this friday night   briggs    you better be there 
"today i have my boy, aidan   we are going to head out soon and enjoy some of this awesome day   hopefully get into a pool so we can chill out for a bit   i hope everyone is having a great day also   have fun!!!"

"was finally able to jump in a pool and cool down!!  so f'n refreshing!!  would've spent half the day there if i could've   thanks <propmale> and <propfemale>, i really appreciated it   cu next weekend for another dip  laugh "

"#1 pick up line:  does this rag smell like chloroform to you?   i can't help laughing, cause i can see some stupid person falling for it!!"
"loving the smell of the rain right now!!  it was so f'n hot at work (surprise surprise) that my shirt was dripping before it started raining     yeah, that bad!  i wish i had time to go for a walk in it before getting my boy, guess that will have to wait for later    if it is still raining by then   smile "

"hanging with my handsome boy aidan     he must have stepped on 50 or so ants on the way to the store earlier    but that was before we even reached the corner of my street!  it would usually take maybe 5 minutes to get there, but with aidan, it took almost 20!!   smile   he's such a riot!  then we just had to take the long way home    which seemed reallllly loooooonnnngggg!  i still wouldn't trade it for anything though "
"hanging out with aidan over at grandma's house, playing with his cousin <propfirst> out in the yard   they get along so well   <propfirst> is dragging aidan around in a sled and then jumping to a <propfirst> deere toy truck and pushing him into a tree     over and over and over    i'm sure it would help if aidan knew how to steer   smile "
"today is a great day   i have aidan with me, he's napping right now and looks so peaceful  smile   when he wakes up, i think we are going to head to the pownal fair and check things out    i hear they have tractor rides and aidan loves the tractors!!  \me ride tractor daddy?  me ride?\""  i'm so lucky  smile """

i just removed 'shedifun' from my apps    let's see if that stops the posts that are not really from me    but from that app somehow    two posts have shown up without me even seeing the apps that they are from    'what would i look like in 20 years' and 'profile peekers'     along with text that i never wrote 
"poke] me if you ever had a crush on me  \[like] this status if i'm a good friend  \[message] me if you ever wanted a relationship  \[comment] on this if we had any great memories  \[if you feel brave], copy this and post it on your status"
