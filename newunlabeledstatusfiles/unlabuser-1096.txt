"if you finally find the perfect one but it doesn't fit do you try to make it fit, or risk finding one that fits but isn't perfect?"
"moving in another tent across post from where i work to make room for pilots  yay i get to ride the bus for an hour to and from work, fml  and guess im going to khandahar on the first"
"is all this really worth it, i gave up everthing i had, but it coninues to take more "
in bagram afghanistan i meet an old friend from high school go figure  <propfirst> rittermier is here too
400 more soldiers just got here its so crowded  hope i go to kandahar soon 
way too long left here  one day at a time is the only way to make it
kandahar delayed again  dam
told my sgt the war on terror would  have to wait  sounds like my old man needs help with the hay   lol 
"im allergic to dust-mites and im in the desert, not a good combo"
"today is the day that the terrorist network will learn to regret, im am here to make sure of that "
boredom is worse than death
wishin i could chill at home with friends
hates the army's stupid shit  let put infantry in charge of intel?????????? what?
going to kandahar dont know when ill be on the net next  dont worry mom ill call asap 
"only been here for a day, i should have stayed in bagram, everythhing is worse here, less space more walking and a poop pond in the middle of post so it smells awsome  fml"
sorry havent posted in a while mom  lil harder to get cpu access here  but all is well  as much as it can be anyways 
"all i can do here is work and go to the gym, hopefully it will make me smart and ripped, then again     ya im too lazy  wink "
the isn't always a right way to do things  sometimes life sticks you with a lose-lose
gym and heat are killin me  missin home  hope <propfemale> will be ok  sad 
wish i could just chill 
"pt,pt,pt  thats all there is to do on my free time  i need lots of snacks to counter this or ill lose all my fat, at least thats what i keep telling myself"
never thought going to the gym would be slightly fun
"just want to thank everyone for your messages and comments over the last few months, knowing there are people at home that care makes things a lot easier over here "
"kiss me while im still alive, kill me while i kiss the sky, let me die on my own terms, let me live and let me learn, now ill follow my own way and ill live on to another dam day, freedom carries sacrafice, remember when this was my life"
"sucks when you sit back and think about things, only to realize your completely alone"
its way too long till ill see home again  sad 
"cold, sore, tiered and hungry and the army goes rolling along"
"sometimes in life you learn your lesson way too late, but i guess better late than never"
hate not being able to be there for the ones i love when they need me
just want to be home
just when i thought the army couldn't get any worse
why do they continue to make rules against relaxing while on deployment as if it wasn't stressful enough  fml

"dear mr president, i hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year  would you also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country? while you're at it, lets cut down congressman's pay too  if the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay, why would we continue raising pay   for those who take no risks and reap the benefits? keep it going if you agree"
who is greater? einstien for his brilliant mind or those who had the courage to give his insane ideas a <propmale>? his mind was a gift  giving him a <propmale> was a choice
