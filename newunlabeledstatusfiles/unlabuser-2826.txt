i want to know what everybody thinks about this tax and unemployment shit thats going on  i think if you work for more than a year you should get unemployment for a year no more no less  doing this would probly save <propfemale> alot of money and americans can still have the confortability of knowing they have that benifit for working especially for the construction sector 
i do think that the tax rate for the ritch should be increased a little bit but i dont think that it should consume there income  the reason why i state this is because most of the ritch are our business owners and quite <propfirst> im pist that they out source all of the labor jobs to other countrys so doing that i think they should be taxed more if they want to look for short cuts
why cant <propfemale> to take some of the burdon off the middle class and our children  i honestly think that american founded companys that out source should pay a tax this will bring jobs back to <propfemale> 
"heres an example of what im talking about, etch a sketch by the ohio <propmale> co  is made in <propfemale>  radio flyer red wagons: made in <propfemale>  levi's: made in latin <propfemale> and <propfemale>  when these and other <propfemale>n icons left the country, so did millions of jobs  many of the more than 5 million manufacturing jobs and 600,000 information-sector jobs that have vanished in the past 10   "
thats our jobs tax the fuck out of them so we have money while were throwing our money away to another country  o wait we might go to war with them wow congress needs to wake up how can you help us if your helping others with our jobs  i wonder how much debt them countrys are in  i say tax them take that burdon off the middle class 
"in response to the <propfirst> game  i have a number for you, #5854  that's how many troops have been killed in iraq and afghanistan protecting our civilian behinds! now that's a status i'd like to see on everyones <propfemale>! rest in peace heroes! may you fly with the angels ? repost if you agree?"
