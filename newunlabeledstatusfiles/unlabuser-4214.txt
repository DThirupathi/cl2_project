just got in ready for bed  tired of doing the hardest part of my job ----- baby sitting lol
tired as hell wishing that i had a day off
counting the day till go on leave looking forward to seeing <propfemale> and the kids
ready for a vacation
gettin close to leave
i leave for r and r in a few hours  see some of you soon
sitting in germany waiting to fly again         only another 10 hour flight until i am in <propfirst> should make it to medford mid afternoon on the 8th      what a process it is to go on r and r these days
so funny story         i might not make it today  we had to abort take off in germany because of one of the wings flaps not working  in the process of slowing down the brakes caught fire and the tires so yeah gotta get off the plane with a quickness while they had the fire department putting on the fire on both rear legs  last we heard they have to do brakes tires and fix the wing so at this point i might not make it
so final word on my flight  the plane is down for a while they can't fix the wing and they don't have the tires or brakes  there is another plane though in atlanta it is supossed to be here in 19 hours they are finishing up fixing that one it broke in atlanta a few days ago  i will be landing at 0800 in <propfirst> with any luck  i knew the timing was to perfect to be home on my birthday but that is the way things go 
still sitting in a airport in germany 26 hours later         
finally made it home last night it is great to see the kids and my wife   <propfemale> took about 2 <propfemale> to warm up to me all the kids are good this time it really made it nice
spent a few hours last night in the e r  <propfemale> opened the truck door on her ring finger  she lost her entire finger nail it might grow back in a few months       she broke the bone in the tip and had to get stitches  she is a trooper she cryed for a few minutes when it happened and was fine until they sewed her up  poor little girl
