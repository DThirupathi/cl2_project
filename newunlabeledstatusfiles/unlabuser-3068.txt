"i've learned that people are always changing  nothing will ever be the same and it sucks when people you know, become people you knew, when you can walk right past someone like they were never a big part of your life, how you used to be able to talk for hours and now how you can barley even look at them  but people change, and friends leave, but some people will always be there for you and life never stops for anyone"
