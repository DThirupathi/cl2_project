talking about how unfair it was that i was kicking them out in the cold    the guy comes back in and asks to use the bathroom    lady comes back in and passes out in the chair   i look over and guy is sitting in the lobby      so at this point im so pissed i call my sup  and she says to call the cops so i finally get to call the cops come and get the one guy off the property   
"the lady didnt wake up so the cop freak out and started yelling at her, she finnally woke and would give the cop her name but told him she was staying at the super 8   cops take both of them to the super 8 to wait for there ride in her room       both were (native a)    on top of this at 3 smile 0 in the morning 5 kids come down and start to swim there all under the age of 14 no parents    "
i kick them out of the pool    20 mins later there back but in the work out room 3 laying on the floor and 2 messing up the machines trying to see how fast they could go again (native a ) we all wonder y they get a bad rap

"are you eating because your stomach is buzzing, or just because it's one way to distract yourself from what life's little anxieties? food should be loved, but not used as a means of avoiding feelings or dealing with emotions you'd rather not be having  instead of picking up a pint of ice cream, ask yourself what you're so scared of  you feel much better, and your physical and emotional health benefit as well "
