wonders why life has to be so complicated 
"it's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy, but you will always love them  re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends  they will know who they are "
"on friday, facebook will start using your photos in ads that will appear on the profile <propfemale> of your contacts  it's legal and is mentioned in the fine print when you create your account  to stop this do the following: account, account settings, then click on facebook ads, choose \no one\"" on the drop-down menu and save changes  copy this and use in a status update **pass along"""
