got told i'm close to being too skinny lol   that's a first 
is getting a flu shot and swine flu shot this afternoon!  exciting stuff 
won my first radio contest ever yesterday and happened to be concert tickets to see lady gaga in january!
boo for getting in a 4 car accident this morning   yay for not being at fault and getting only bumper damage 
is tired of fucking stress 
"things happen for a reason     how true   if you didn't forget to send me your new number, then i wouldn't have found out what type of person you've become   understandable to get upset because you thought i didn't call on purpose but when you realized you didn't give me your number and you act like that anyway? what happened to the friend i grew up with?"
what a week 
don't officially count weight until mondays but fuck it   i was 159 this morning which is below my goal of 160  woot woot 
is glad it's friday!
think it will be better to see new <propfemale> on wednesday since the crowd should have died some but the wait is killing me lol!
"after today, off until monday   then seeing new <propfemale> tonight   can't wait!"
counting down 
so much to do     
so tired of attitude 
"isn't procasting for a change, strange "
is cooooooooold 
it's the big week! yay for not having as much stuff as i thought 
holy shit   moving is tiring business!
10 days until another birthday     how the time flies 
"imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring  -  <propfemale> <propmale> this is the third <propfemale> quote that i love   i never knew she said such good stuff "
down 60 pounds     probably a good stopping point heh 
is so looking forward to only working monday and tuesday this week     just hoping to make it through them   blah 
off to get 1 work day out of 2 this week under way!
after 5 surprise 0     no more work till 12 28!
3 days without the internet is far too long and having it at work on tuesday doesn't count 
so weird not to be in nc for my birthday but gonna make the best of it 
found out from a mall trip that i'm wearing a small now   craziness!
yuck   bad case of the dry mouth today 
4 days left until seeing lady gaga!
guess i'll be braving the craziness of parliament on new year's <propfemale> again tonight!
"is something awful supposed to happen if you don't kiss someone at new year's?  if so, can i make up for it later heh?"
"the lady gaga concert was fantastic!  it had it's weird, dark and sexy moments that you come to e playful ect and love from her but also heartfelt moments where she thanked the fans   she even cried during speechless   the best concert i've ever been to by far!  i forget about my cold the minute she came on but i feel it again haha   my voice may almost be  gone from the screaming but it was worth it!"
grrr   i don't need extra things to worry about when i feel like crap 
i think i've lost it 
"let's see how forthcoming my facebook friends are  leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me  it can only be 1 word  no more than 1 word  then copy & paste this post on your wall so i can leave a word about you  this should be interesting   wonder if i have 20, or more, brave friends who will do this!"
"so much to do, so little time to do it in in "
is glad it's the weekend!  ready to go out and possibly see a movie 
is messed up in the head
"avatar     what a fantastic fucking movie and i have to say my new favorite movie!  loved the story, loved the effects, loved it all   and it was my first 3d movie and it was a good choice   think i'll go see it on imax 3d next weekend, havent seen a movie on imax before "
i should really save all this insurance money until i get an estimate on my car but i can't justify that it will take all of it   surely 1000 will be enough to fix it lol   already made one purchase which i will share tomorrow but thinking about getting an iphone   for those of you that have one     are they that great?  i have an ipod touch so i know it's fairly similar to that but of course has phone features 
so the big purchase i mentioned yesterday     i'm getting a tattoo today after work!  it will complete my zodiac set   going to be pisces for my rising sign and going on my back   can't wait!
needs some r&r!
has been far too busy this week     is ready to wind down and have fun damn it!
"aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at cmabrigde uinervtisy, it dseno't mtaetr in waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae  tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe  if you can raed tihs, psot it to yuor wlal  olny 55% of plepoe can"
so i caved and bought an iphone   now it's like i have two ipod touch's but one does a hell of alot more 
"so my nose is runny and my throat hurts   if i am getting sick again after not completely getting sover the last one, there will be hell to pay! i dunno who or what will pay for it but i'll find someone or something haha "
is so ready for the weekend!  have had two super intense busy weekends in a row!
feeling frisky and loopy
ummm my fine is $710 60 0 surprise )
sometimes i really don't get me

is ready to have a fun filled weekend playing mass effect 2 and going out to the blacklight party on saturday at p house 
"got a short-sleeve white button-up shirt to wear to the blacklight party tonight   you can see my tats underneath too, love it!"
feels good to have tv again   can't believe i didn't have it for over a month 
"go to urbandictionary com, type in your first name, copy and paste this as your status and the first entry for your name under comments "
more from urbandictionary com     how come mine is nice lol and people are getting dirty stuff?
"is it friday yet?  why yes, yes it is!"
needs to learn moderation!
going to another dimension   what should i bring?
is in la la land 
didn't mean to pass out last night but i guess i needed the sleep 
"if someone really wrote you out of their life, would they still have your number?  hmm i don't think so lol "
"had a great productive week, now ready to have a fun filled weekend!"
had a great friday night!
these weekends need to stop going by so damn quickly 
"bracing myself for a busy week, so excited i can hardly contain myself ; ) "
had a nice monday evening!
happy hump day!
this week better go by fast!
is jumpier than a virgin at a prison rodeo!
i'm wound up tighter than a girdle  on a baptist minister's wife at an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast 
got some much needed rest last night     woo hoo!  now ready for the weekend 
omg it's monday!  i can't contain the excitement!!!!
looking forward to a fun evening!
neeeeeds a massage and a nap 
it feels good to give!
sooooooo glad it's the weekend!  ready to have fun and sleep in 
had a great time last night   now off to get my hair cut!
"is going to take a nap   if you need me, send the message to me via psychic projection and i will collect it in my mental voicemail "
woo hoo wednesday already 
tgif!
you'd think with these other voices in my head it would be easier to come a decision but noooo 
monday is way too close   please go away 
likes it when things look promising 
looking forward to going to pf <propfirst>'s for the first time and seeing <propfemale> tonight with a cutie ;o) 
why do my naps always turn into several hour affairs?
feeling a bit better today     lets hope that continues!!!
ready for the weekend!!!
"ready to have a terrific, tantalizing, titillating tuesday "
"for the first time ever since the show has been on, completely not interested in watching idol tonight   been a very disappointing season   still care who wins but don't think i am invested enough to follow along anymore lol "
why does today seem like friday?  is it friday but everyone is playing a prank on me hehe ;op?
happy hump day!
bought more clothes that fit me last week   wasn't thrilled with how they looked when i got home so took most of them back last night   much better choices this time around!
ugh   i keep getting this urge to pierce my upper ear again   but two things stop me   1-i've had it done two times before and took them out   but that was with the piercing gun so maybe a piercing shop would do it better?  and 2-not sure how they'd like it at work lol 
tgif!  and i think it's gonna be a great one 
anyone else as excited as i am that tomorrow is monday?
"tfgif!!!!!  no, the f after t is not a typo   if you wanna know what the f stands for, it rhymes with sucking   also, direct happy thoughts my way if you don't mind   i'm hoping for a good outcome for a couple of things : ) "
looking forward to a nice afternoon evening 
pretty much slept the weekend away but at least i had good company for a good portion of it   and vacation starting tomorrow!
gearing up for my short trip back to nc tomorrow   can't believe it's been a year since i have been back 
it's great to come back home but weird too since i feel like such a different person compared to who i was when i lived here 
"was great to see family and friends again in nc but good to be home too, though not looking forward to the backlog of stuff i have to do at work tomorrow  surprise ( "
"glad yesterday is over   what a crazy, nutty, exhausting day   now ready to count down until the weekend!"
"can anyone recommend a comfy, nice and spacious insane aslyum?  five <propfemale> rating is preferable "
"so glad parts of my face don't feel numb anymore   if that's what botox feels like, then i hope my mom's \look younger than you are\"" <propfirst> power lasts as long as possible!!!"""
"if you surrender to the wind, you can ride it   ~toni morrison   \\i'm really feeling the message of this quote right now "
almost thursday already     this week is cruising along   woo hoo 
a shitty ending to a shitty season of idol 
ughhhhhhhhh 
"sorry i haven't posted lately   i lost my sanity and have been on a hunt for it   so far, no luck   anyone seen it?"
and the rest is history    
just got an injury while i was vaccuuming   i never knew cleaning could be so dangerous   maybe i subconsciously knew it before and that's why i didn't do it very often?
stress stress stress stress   ugh 
scraped my finger last night while cleaning   what's with the injuries while cleaning??????
saw eclipse yesterday     loved loved loved it   my favorite of the movies so far 
"i think this needs to be my new mantra haha   i already have it on my profile but need to remember this more often!\\\imperfection is beauty", madness is genius and it's better to be \d7e3ffbf505765516eee892b508bd388,"what to do, what to do???"
just found this quote   it doesn't mention who said it but i completely identify with it     â€œbeing normal isnâ€™t one of my strengths â€�
happy friday everyone!
thinking too much today     feels like i need a big change in my life 
what a crazy end this work week had   ready to kick off the weekend and have fun!
"so much change going on lately     oh well, it can be a good thing i have to remember   on an unrelated note, tgif!!!!!!"
omggggggggggggggggggggg 
hmmm 
"totally forgot it was friday the 13th this evening     hmm, well i did have a weird annoying night so far "
"just found this quote and love it   unfortunately, i fall victim to this all too often \\â€œmany of us crucify ourselves between two thieves - regret for the past and fear of the future â€� -- fulton oursler"
"anyone have <propfemale> <propfirst>'s new album?  my two favorite tracks have got to be \e t \"" and \""who am i living for?\""   i loooove em """
"i think i'm the victim of instant <propfemale>, which has suggested before looking at my astrological chart   so i make a purchase this afternoon i probably shouldn't have and then my tire (which i have been meaning to take care of but haven't yet) goes flat   grrr lol   at least i was near a tire store "
so this morning the tire opposite the one that was flat last week was completely flat   i guess i ran over something lol?  all i know is nothing better happen to the back two tires!!!
"so guess what happened tonight?  another damn tire went flat   this time it was the rear left one   that's the third flat tire (all different) in less than a month   either i'm having incredibly bad luck or they are all giving out at one time   at this rate, i might as well replace the one that hasn't gone flat yet because i am sure it will lol "
"anyone in the mood to pack up stuff in boxes and move it for me for free?  if so, do i have an offer for you!"
thinking about taking a vacation to the insane asylum 
"â€œyou do anything long enough to escape the habit of living\until the escape becomes the habit â€�"
i think my new year's resolution should be working on not keeping myself in a bubble and not pushing people away   been like this since at least middle school probably but it's gotten a lot worse lately     sorry to anyone i might have done this to 
"\i believe everything happens for a reason  people change so you can learn to let go  things go wrong so you appreciate them when they're right  and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together \"" - <propfemale> <propmale>"""
thanks everyone for the birthday wishes!
working on breaking down all these fucking walls 
i'm ready to make some big changes 
"starting today, gonna try as hard as hell to stop putting myself in my own cage and locking everyone and everything out "
enjoying the weekend!
"\a journey of a thousand <propmale> begins with a single step \"" - confucius"""
anyone wanna give me $300-500 (rough estimate) ;o)?  i'm in the mood to get a tattoo to <propfirst> this time in my life   i bet you could deduct it on your taxes as a donation to the arts heh ;op 
super fucking excited for the grammy's on sunday and almost all of it has to do with hearing lady gaga's new single!!!  she better win shit too 
"since it's hump day, does that mean i need to follow through on the humping part?"
"love gaga's new single \born this way\""!  she must have known i was going to get sick before i did so she moved up the release date to help make me feel a bit better heh """
this is weird 
"so, i feel like i've had an epiphany   i'm tired of not being my true myself all of the time     too often i either change myself to please someone or to not hurt their feelings or i let fear and anxiety prevent me from opening up and being me all the time   i've had enough of this   i have the right to be myself 100% of the time, as do we all, and i plan on getting rid of my bad habits starting now "
"yesterday was completely nuts   the first half was completely awful and then the last half was absolutely great   that's a theme of my life though it seems, no moderation or in between lol   but very happy it had a happy ending "
i can't believe i walked 4 <propmale> yesterday!  i didn't plan on it but it happened and very glad i did   gave me a great feeling and put me in a great mood the rest of the day and i definitely needed that 
"so i was wanting to get another tattoo   i looked around today, did some research and now i have the design for 3 more tattoos lol   as soon as i have the funds, gonna get em!"
