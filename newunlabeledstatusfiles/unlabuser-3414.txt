hoping everyone has a fantastic new year's eve!!!!spending mine with my beautiful girls and the awesome leehy family in st  <propfirst>!!!!
"i made no resolutions for the new year   the habit of making plans, of criticizing, sanctioning and molding my life, is too much of a daily event for me"
getting ready to get back to work!!!
no more pity party!!!time to put my dancing shoes on and forget about the past  can't wait for the blackhorse party tonight!!!
loves getting felt up on!!!
play kicked my butt!!!
"all this <propfemale> is making me nervous!!!!but it would be kinda mean not to let them eat it,huh?"
managed to do absolutely nothing today but to stay in her pj's and tend to a fake farm on my computer!!
work went rather smoothly today smile 
"this weekend has started out so awesome with my little girls it'll only get better with the leehy familt tomorrow  and then next weekend, time for the big girls weekend!!woohoo loving my life right now!!"
"i don't need no stinking man to do something for me!!!i am so proud of myself that i went to lowe's, asked the hillbilly for help and proceeded to fix my sink myself and i made sure my girls saw me do it!"
is on my way to a yoga class at the ymca and <propfemale> is doing it with me!!it's our first time so wish us luck!
"if anyone ever tells you that yoga is easy or that it doesn't give your body a run for it's money, they are lying!!! my old body is in some serious pain!"
"is at home, sick  i vow to never eat the chicken and sausage gumbo from work again  it didn't feel good coming up through my nose sad "
i soff to work for a very long shift come visit me!!!
"i had a really nice surprise from a couple of regulars at work yesterday and it really made my day  i hope today is just as nice  you see, kissing butt to your customers can pay off!"
a
is going to work a long double shift tomorrow so that maybe she buy a little something for her girls during the big sales on friday!!
sometimes you have to lose something to realize that what you were looking for was there the whole time happy thanksgiving to all of you!!!what are you thankful for?
"needs to focus on the positive by the way, can you tell me what the positive is again?"
"so in my mind it was supposed to be a perfect day  shopping for the girls, taking them to the movies and then the leehy's  but it never goes as planned and i am beginning to worry that my girls might be the most spoiled girls in the world!!!"
eating my favorite-doritos chips and cheese dip!!yummy!!!but only until weigh-ins for the blackhorse's biggest loser 
"your ex-lover is dead is such a wonderful song, really "
that was pretty much an awesome game!
"the lady at the bookstore told me the piano teacher was good but i didn't think it was this good  great, another night where i am up until 2 in the morning, reading!!"
"a chicken and an egg are lying in bed   the chicken is smoking a cigarette with a satisfied smile on its face and the egg is frowning and looking put out   the egg mutters to no one in particular, \i guess we answered that question \"""""
"what you need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened, it has all worked together to bring you to this very moment   and this is the moment you can choose to make everything new   right now "
"have you ever been hurt and the place tries to heal a bit, and you just pull the scar off of it over and over again?"
"the statistics on sanity are that one out of every four americans is suffering from some form of mental illness   think of your three best friends   if they're okay, then it's you "
i'm so poor i can't even pay attention
relationships are like glass   sometimes it's better to leave them broken than try to hurt yourself putting it back together 
a woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one
"when i die, i want to go peacefully like my grandfather did, in his sleep -- not screaming, like the passengers in his car "
the first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: decide what you want 
"the secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age "
"here i come, ugly sweater party!!!!(even though my sweater isn't that ugly!)"
has lost her phone again!!!!where can it be???
"found her phone, haha!"
"i cannot continue to question the decisions that i make  i am not going to change so i may as well just go with it i am just crossing my fingers that it will pay off in the long run, no matter how long that run takes "
"\the love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned â€� why does this have to be so freakin' true?!"""
the trouble with the rat race is that even if you win you're still a rat 
how is it that you can go into work in a wonderful mood and come out in a pretty crappy one?that place has some contagious moods!!!

still recovering from the party  going to bed really early!!!
"my poor baby girl is so sick last night was horrible, she didn't go to school and i have to go to work  all i want to do is take care of her "

"feels like a total bum since she hasn't left her house all day!!! and then to top it all off, school is cancelled, again, tomorrow!!when do i get to work again??"

"needs a xanax, or valium, or hell a beer would work so i won't pull my hair out from these kids fighting all day i opted for a <propfemale> toaster streudel instead and now i just feel fat and stressed!wth?!"
cannot emphasize enough just how much she hates being ignored!!i don't care if it's my mom doing it!!!don't ignore me!
"my phone is broken, so if you have tried to contact me, i wasn't ignoring you!!!should have a phone back by tonight "
omg!!!i just watched my sister's keeper and i haven't cried that much in a long time!!!
"wonders why people are always so worried about my business, who i am seeing, what i am doing it is none of your business unless i make it so "
it really sucks knowing that some people will never change even though you try so hard with them 
is it friday yet?
"glad to have my girls with me!!!got some stuff on my mind, but a little more content "
"i wanted to keep sleeping so badly this morning  instead, i get to go wait tables  will it ever end?!!!!"
i am about to lay down with <propmale> grace and do what we do best!!cuddle and sleep in mommy's big bed!
"had a lot of fun last night baby steps, baby steps "
"have you ever felt so crazy because everything told you something was right? well i did a while ago and everybody thought i was!!!but i know it is paying off  dammit, persistence and <propfemale> is the key!"
is doing absolutely nothing until <propfemale>'s soccer game later!!feels good to lay around in my robe!
"one minute i am sure, the next i'm not  i hate being a woman sometimes!someone take me shopping so i can reaffirm that i actually enjoy it most of the time!!!"
it's monday again sad  don't have a lot to look forward to except my day off on wednesday  i let stupid things bother me way too much 
"just did not feel this day!!it's kind of like my brain is somewhere else and my body is just following its usual movements  not a very satisfying feeling  i need something to stimulate me, but i can't figure out what it is "
cannot wait for the blackeyed peas show!!!!we are going to have so much fun!!!
is going to try to accomplish as much as she can tomorrow (after har nap!)

"i hate when things change  just hate it  but it will all be for the better, i hope "
mind your business people!!just mind your own business!!!geez!!!
so i bawled my eyes out when i read the time traveler's wife  why did i think it would be any different when i watched the movie???
"remember how much i hate change? well sure, it sucks, but sometimes it is the only thing that makes you see things the way you need to i tell you what, though, i wouldn't change a single minute of any of it "
people are going to treat you the way you let them!!!
"had a very exhausting weekend with the girls  my hair smells like charcoal, my beer tastes great and i am waiting   "
i wish the weather would stay like it was yesterday and maybe this funk will go away 32 more days and i go to l a !!!
"me add??no way!!i really don't agree with that statement, mr ! i like to consider it scatter-brained, thank you very much!!"
i have such an uneasy feeling in my stomach  please go away!!
"do you think it's smarter to be in denial but feel happiness or to face the truth and go through a world of hurt?it'll eventually feel better, but      "
"will the magical energy <propfemale> please help me out today, please?!!i got maybe a total of 4 hours of sleep and have to work 11 hours  can't wait to see what i am like tonight  should be funny or scary!"

and i thought it was just going to be dinner!holy crap!
it has been 4 years since i got to have a baby all to myself i can't wait to have baby <propfemale> here!
"which one should we go see, black swan, ture grit or the fighter?!"
the fighter was awesome!!!
slumber party time at my house!!!
"someone told me today that people are mean to me because they know i won't say anything back  i guess i feel that if someone wants to get mad at me or be mean to me, when i haven't done anything, has something wrong with them  i am a believer in picking and choosing your battles and the ones that i have encountered lately are simply a waste of my time "
"i had to get onto p tonight because she was sassing me after i slightly raised my voice,yes slightly wink ,all the kids are silent and <propfemale> says to me,'she never does that at school!'i know sweet <propfemale>,it's only to her mommy "
"i can understand how the duggars have all those kids the older ones raise the younger ones!!madison was so helpful last night and today  she has such a gift with kids, they just gravitate towards her  parker?eh, not so much "
so proud of <propfemale>'s straight a's but very upset at the thought of some little girl picking on parker not going to happen 
"omg, freaking out right now!!!some kind of manhunt going on right in my neighborhood!!!i wish this house was picked up and put in a nicer part of town "
"if you notice a zombie walking around work,its just me sucks that i am not getting the sleep i wanted due to a crazy person being chased!baseball bat and mace are right by my bedside "
"if you are going down a road and don't like what's in front of you and look behind you and don't like what you see, get off the road  create a new path!"
i guess i am just a mean person sad 
holy crap!stuck at a gas station and having to leave my car here how did it get so bad?!
this has really turned out to be a crappy day!got stuck at a gas station  ex-husband had to come get me  finally make it home and i don't have my phone!i think it is in my car sad 
last night was a crappy night for me and so glad today is here  i hope my phone is in my car and not on the snowy ground  and i hope my car won't have any trouble making it home!
yay!!!!i got my phone back!
so any plans that we had today have fallen through due to the fever my poor p has  i hope it is just a 24 hour bug she actually turned the tv off and said she wanted to go back to sleep  now that is a bad sign!
"so every year i take a vacation by myself  i think the girls are old enough to appreciate a trip to the beach now  anybody have suggestions on where to stay on the panhandle that would be fun for them but they wouldn't be e playful osed to typical spring break stuff? oh, and economical, too smile "
so my poor baby girl is even sicker than i thought  she turned off the lights and tv herself so she could go to sleep  at 6!
"not a very good start to the day still a sick p but this time a little vomit got thrown in i hate it when my babies are sick,hate it "
"so since <propmale> is sick,madison isn't here so for the last two days i have been confined to my bedroom with a quiet 6 year old although,i hate that she is sick,i can't e playful lain how bored i am and how much i wish for adult interaction!"
"i don't understand why some people have pets  it is horrible that my neighbor leaves that little thing outside, attched by his leash to the fence, barking since 11 this morning and then tells it to shut up because he is barking did you think he might be cold since he looks all about 7 pounds?!!!"
"pickled jalapenos,raw jalapenos,roasted jalapenos,stuffed jalapenos, i dont care what kind of jalapeno!i can eat them with anything or at anytime!i love them!"
taking <propmale> to the doctor today so that they confirm what i already know  she has a virus and needs lots of fluids and rest  i wonder why i even bother going sometimes 
"just like i predicted, a virus that we can do nothing about all i can do is let her rest and love on her even more than i have been "
i just want one day where i don't argue with a 9 year old if she only realized how good she has it!
"dear old man winter,\it was all cute and stuff the first time i saw you rear your ugly head our way  but that was the holiday season  that time is over so i am ready for your old a*s to move out of the way and let beautiful spring shine through \sincerely,\the woman with frozen hands and feet "
"for one second,do you think i would back down from an argument?no way,if its something that's about my kids "
i am definitely paying for last night but it was so worth it!!!i don't think one person had a badt time!!!
"hurry up , stewie, i am starving!!!!"
i got some food in my belly and i think i might pass out on this desk looking forward to see what this weekend has in store for me smile 
oh how i love randomness in my life!
"it was soooo difficult waking up this morning  waiting on my coffee to wake me up and then it's friday at the pub smile  have to admit, i am really excited about tonight!"
who took the grey jersey dress out of the closet at work???
who took the grey shirt out of the closet at work?!!i have your grey cardigan as hostage!!
"happy,happy,happy!"
holy crap!!!this phone is awesome!
"got a new computer, too!i needed it badly "
date night again?it must be my lucky day!
looks like i got ready for nothing sucks 
well finally made it to nashville smile i hope he remembers this date!geez!!
sometimes things just go right i love it!
30 year old women rock smile 
"butterflies,please go away i really need to eat!"
"it is monday and it is going to be a great day, i just know it "
i will keep an open mind this time 
"tuesday, i need you to hurry up and pass so wednesday can as well and thursday can finally be here!"
so i think my mouth is going to get me in some serious trouble one of these days soon 
"a whopping 12 degrees at 7 a m  tomorrow morning in clarksville wonderful, just wonderful "
note to self: stop being condescending hmmm    
very very bad dreams last night  what is going on?
"some people are just wrong that is what i get, though i thought <propfemale> already paid me back "
"another note to self: if someone continuously tells you that they are weird,they probably are "
"ugggghhhh, now i need something to do tomorrow night "
"omg, what happened?!"
guess what? i'm not working today and i am going back to sleep smile 
<propfemale> night!!!i don't know if that is good since tequilla makes me feisty 
"have i ever emphasized how much i hate fake people?seems like i am surrounded by them everyday\is it that hard to be real? i'm thinking it is for you "
"mother nature, please behave so that i can take the girls to the frist and the spaghetti factory tomorrow  it's our girls day smile "
it looks like nashville is on but first it's off to get all 3 of us a haircut 
i need a nap now not looking forward to the drive home 
"i will not spend a lot of money at walmart,dangit!"
"yup,spending money hey, i needed new bathroom accessories"
i love skype!!!!!
do you think it is ever really possible to stop putting yourself in situations that you know will only end up hurting you? i wonder that sometimes 
<propmale>'s world on snl?!?!?!that just made my night!
runny nose?check headache?check congestion?check sinus infection?thinking so 
"i am about to take an area rug and matching runner to goodwill in about an hour or so  if you are interested, i will give it to you for free  need to get rid of it today, though "
"oh onions, i will still taste you tonight good thing i don't have anybody to kiss!"
loving all the new little additions i have bought for my house!
"go ahead and get your wallets out now people!!!madison and <propmale> are raising money for the american heart association  all of you stepped it up last year for them, what can you do for them this year?!"
so i can't be stupid anymore now that i know all this 
so maybe it isn't a sinus infection
i can't breathe!
feels sorry for some people 
nashville what?
you know what is going to be awesome?talking to tables sounding like a man 
i totally cursed myself by saying that i never get sick!
had a fantastic night at work!
"alright, mucinex, everybody is saying that you are going to help a sister out  let;s see what you got!"
"sooooo sick today, mucinex didn't do crap  hopefully a weekend in the bed, doing absolutely nothing but taking care of myself will help  who has some chicken noodle soup?"
"just ask me if i have been out of bed today go ahead,ask"
"apparently,i am trouble how am i trouble anymore?"
"ok,cough,you can leave me now i am not having anymore fun sounding like a man "

"every year, when i was growing up, my mom would get me something special for <propfirst>'s just to show me she loved me  i am doing the same for my girls this year and i can't wait for them to see their baskets smile "
i may have gone a little overboard on gifts for the girls for tomorrow i just get so excited to see their faces!
"omg,madison is not only playing travel soccer this year but we also just signed her up for travel softball so both girls in sports,all summer long oh my!"
"i am glad eminent won\check snl's weekend update skit appearing 'him and lil wayne' freaking hilarious!"

today is going to be beautiful outside so it has to be good inside!
"my horoscope for today:you are so alive with ideas,ambitions and love,sweet love with so much to enjoy about your life,there is hardly a moment to waste "
me and p tonight i love it when she is sweet to me!
"i just asked <propmale> why she doesn't help put groceries away like her sister and that little punk said because she is lazy and likes to watch tv instead  thanks for the honesty, p!"
"why is it that when i have a <propmale> to get off my feet, which i am on all day, i don't do it? habit?"
i want to be a braverman!!!
"i love being able to open the windows up!bartending today, come and visit me people  (just not from 12-1 when i am super busy!)"
