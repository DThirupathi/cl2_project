the girl you just called fat? she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs  the boy you just called stupid? he has a learning disability & studies over 4 hrs a night the girl you just called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her the boy you just tripped? he is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  put this as your status if you're against bullying
