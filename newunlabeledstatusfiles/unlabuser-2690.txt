hooray for family disfunction!

my hands are tied the billions shift from side to side and the wars go on with brainwashed pride for the love of god and our human rights    and history hides the lies of our civil wars

"dear california, you suck "
ill be at the top of <propmale> grade if anyone needs me
im getting tired of this routine  its hard to escape when almost everyone in this hole does nearly the same shit everyday 
and just when you feel like your the only one going crazy    the parents start fighting over a light bulb 
the pain is much more than physical beyond belief when we're alone
i wish i had the foresight to know that my life would feel so empty without you
back in tustin for the week 
apparently sleep isnt on my to do list 
i always felt different  out of place somehow  maybe i was right    wont stop me either way 
just when you think your empty there is always that little left you just need to scrape out
i think i need to make it a point to come down here more often  its nice to clear my head 
almost 3 in the morning  wonder if the sandman knows im still up 
thanks everyone  waking up to your birthday wishes was awesome   laugh

"insomnia is a gross feeder   it will nourish itself on any kind of thinking, including thinking about not thinking   ~clifton fadiman"

"staying awake vs the possibility of you creeping into my dreams  yea, id rather stay awake "
i need a new life  i think ill start tomorrow

step 2: cut down on the smoking (hopefully quit)
"change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon\ from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same  until \monday (dec 6) there should be no human faces on facebook, only an \invasion of memories  this is for violence against children"
registered for spring semester  not dropping classes this time no matter what 
im better than that  i wont make the same mistakes again 
"last dance, first kiss\\your touch, my bliss\\beauty always comes with dark thoughts"
got an interview at disneyland!

i don't know why i'm still thinking of you  i think you helped me without even realizing it  thank you  don't forget that your beautiful 
people say that what we're seeking is a meaning for life  i don't think that's what we're really seeking  what we seek is an e playful erience of being alive  -<propfirst> campbell
where is my mind?
"i get frightened in all this darkness\i get nightmares and i hate to sleep alone\i need some company\a guardian angel to keep me warm when the cold wind blows"
well im out of ideas to make this day more productive  im just gona go for a drive i guess 
vodka    they had to give me vodka
"to all my facebook friends !!! will you all be willing to donate your status for just a few minutes to honor a fallen <propfemale> who's just passed away while serving our country? cpl  <propmale> <propmale> (usmc) died dec 6 while serving in afghanistan  he leaves behind a wife and a newborn son named in his honor, who was born approx  24 hours after news of his death repost to honor this hero and his family"
anyone doing anything tonight? im feeling a movie night
bored  have absolutely no intention of sleeping anytime soon  anyone want to chill?
maybe some time away will do me some good  i hate this town 
tomorrow my job hunt might finally be over  fingers crossed  say a little prayer for me 
didnt get the job  just keep swimming
why would i want that job anyway? any company that would shut down someone for one unfavorable response when the rest of the interview they where shining doesnt seem like they are looking to help people anyway 
"with this recent development im back to job searching and odd jobs  if anyone knows of any work give me a heads up  ill clean houses, i can do plumbing, some electrical and other various odd jobs  just let me know "
sunday is probably my last day down here  last <propmale> to chill before the new year 
not heading out today  apparently <propfemale> has an issue with rain 
lol my mind is all blank and fuzzy
haven't slept  it's going to be a long day 
im going to quit drinking for a while  depressed me seems to have replaced drunk me 
<propfemale> christmas  i wish you all the best 
vodka bad  sad 
drained
im tired of all of this  nothing makes sense to me anymore  i wish i knew what to do 
karaoke night! whos down to go?
im never going to find what im looking for here  maybe a few years away would do me some good 
i miss my bros  sad 
down in tustin for the week  text me
i don't think a single person who's ever looked into astrology will give up the sign they grew up associating themselves with  spare me the technicalities science! i'll always be a scorpio!
morning world  im off to yoga 
"wish i knew why women are so psycho  youd think after all these years someone would have figured it out  maybe estrogen causes \im a rotten bitch\"" syndrome """
i think my friend count is bs  theres no way i have that many friends  if you haven't talked to me in the past couple years and dont intend on doing so ever just delete me already 
i haven't put on my nicotine patch yet today and i feel ok  no nic fits yet  ill keep one close just in case 
i would have smoked an extra 74 if i did not quit smoking 4 days and 22 hours ago!
i hate myself
i dont know what i can do to fix this   
i like how desperate you are to make me the bad guy
strength and flexibility  i need a whole lot of both 
spent the afternoon with <propmale> and baby <propfemale>  just when i think i dont have anything to smile about i realize how wrong i am 
coffee coffee coffee
hooray for nap time!
so bored
the depths of your stupidity amazes me  to think someone could actually be that dumb without needing any form of assistance  bravo 
best superbowl party ever
i am definitely not a morning person
i really need to stop these late nights and early mornings
yoga time
gave blood today cause im awesome  you can be awesome too 
glass of wine and then bed  i need to get a case of this stuff 
i got the rest of the day off  i'm not sure what i'll do with my free time but first things first; coffee!
sleeping in feels awesome
 laugh 
there is something i need to tell you; i am not left handed!
one of the best weekends ever  happy valentines day everyone 
yesterday wasnt too great but i had a weekend that more than made up for it  i finally recovered my spark   laugh 
far too drunk to consider posting a status
who would have figured that exercise would counteract a hangover?  laugh 
i have way too much on my mind
making tacos with friends  smile 
i dont know why i let myself get carried away with what will never be  why cant i just be happy with what i have? i think ill start today 
i'm nobodies fool and i dont like being lied to 
drinking with <propfirst> and <propfirst>
indescribable
still smiling
not sure what i'm e playful ected to do  guess i'll just ride this one out 
i'm trying
anyone can whistle
feels like i have a knife in my leg  ugh this workout is going to suck  sad 
very confused  who do i trust?
i love waking up to an argument    not
so i need to get my car     anyone want to give me a lift?
apparently moderation isnt in my dictionary  time to stop another vice before it too becomes a problem 
i dont even feel like going to guitar class     guess i dont really have a choice  kinda makes me wish i would have practiced 
today's workout is going to be awesome 
class at 8 in the morning and i dont even really want to sleep  feels like my night is missing something 
thats right people at mcdonalds! look in awe at my glorious subway sandwich and feel terrible about yourselves!
its only noon and iv ran out of things to do with my day 
uneventful day  hopefully my night is more fulfilling 
my night was way better
cooking talapia and rice  simple but delicious 
no <propmale>er how bad my day gets i know it could be worse  i could be a closet case like that <propmale> <propmale> guy   playful 
why do i have to be allergic to something so cute and fluffy?  sad 
well i might have a job  go me 
got to watch the mayhem as it unfolded  gave me nightmares about tsunami  i'll pray for you japan

watching the <propfemale> bride   smile 
laundry day
haven't had a cigarette in a month and 17days
just got home from my interview  i'll know by wednesday 
exhausted
happy st  patties!
last night was epic! on to another adventure!
need to find something to do 
yoga got canceled today on account of it being too cold to workout  guess i'm hitting the gym after my next class 
i hate this feeling  its the same feeling i got every time before i attempted to escape this crappy town    the only difference now is i dont know where to escape to 
sucker punch was awesome!
still awake
its a pirates life for me
i have a feeling this wont end in fluffy bunnies   
i predict a whole lot of suck in the near future 
intense feeling of <propfemale> vu    cant quite put my finger on it but this all seems eerily familiar
cpr and first aid training= +10 to my handiness
a shepherdess is quite a mess but little lambs are lovely 
i'm not sure whats going on  this is where i take a step back 
i haven't smoked 1026 cigarettes since i quite 
i'm worth more than you try to make me feel  if you didn't get the memo the <propfirst> that let people degrade him without retaliation vacated a while ago  don't mess with me 
should probably be practicing   
there were so many fewer questions when stars were still just the holes to heaven
had an awesome nap  now who should i bug? hmmm   
been feeling a bit off lately  maybe a morning workout is just what i need to get my head on straight 
i'm not at all surprised by the possibility of a shutdown  why should congress care? they still get paid 
"and just for fun annoyed if you're not scared put this on your status and see what people rate you  (1) crazy  (2) i'd marry you  (3) i want to date you  (4) sarcastic  (5) i miss you  (6) i'd kiss you  (7) beautiful  ( smile  smart  (9) imaginative  (10) random  (11) hot  (12) funny  (13) fit  (14) amazing  (15) tough  (16) cute  (17) i'd hit you with a bus  (1 smile i love you  (19) weirdo"
<propfirst> pilgrim vs the world is amazing!
one good thing about my car is that she always has something for me to work on  its like free e playful erience points 
"\i dont need another tax cut\"" i love you obama"""
i hate having to end my night so early  curse you traffic court!

"laundry, workout, hangout  sounds like a plan "
