well today    uh    er    um    has been a day?    at least theatre people at rhs are the bomb  it brightened my day that much more to spend a couple hours in the mass chaos that comes with a group of thespians 
"super sleepy, don't feel good, and missing people  sad "
"the past week has been the hardest i have had in a very long time, but things turned around this evening for my birthday  it was wonderful to share some smiles and silly dancing (to the newsies soundtrack of course!) with my family  smile "
"welp, time to go wave the freak flag  i am going to school all decked out in 80's gear today! i wonder how socially unaccepted i'm going to be after this   "
"just doing homework, watching dancing with the stars, and eating a freeze dried ice cream bar  gotta hurry and finish up so i can go see a movie with my mom "
will be attending the park city music film festival on friday  smile   love 
ugh    i hate feeling like crap    someone please shoot me

"constantly inquire towards the future, live in the moment, never look back but always remember "

"nothing like a wonderful day finished with a good convo, so you think you can dance, and raspberry bars  love "
first batch of raspberry bars should be done at 1    then i have to put the second tray in    and this my dear friends is why i don't make these stupid things all that often  time to start cutting in more butter    at least i'm getting a work out of sorts!
"well today was a pretty good day, except i think that i am losing my voice  sad  oh and i found a freaking grey hair! i'm 17! this isn't supposed to happen! what the heck?!"

"so i had the brilliant idea to go outside and watch the sunrise this morning and i don't think i have ever seen such a beautiful sight  perhaps it was the purple glow of the mountains in the west and the yellow light peeking over those in the east, or the pondering that took place, but all in all it was utterly splendid  i need to do this more often  today will be an incredible day!"
letters to <propfemale> was simply adorable! i loved it  hmm so my mom said i reminded her of jabba the hut    should i be offended?
i'm gonna go up and make me some waffles!!!!  love 
"warning: <propfemale> is officially boycotting make-up! the stupid stuff is too much of a pain in my butt to constantly be applying, touching up, and removing   over and over and over again!"
"had a meeting this morning and it went great, then breakfast with mom, and a wonderful summer afternoon nap  now it's time to blast some 80's music to wake me up so that i can shower, do the dishes, and get to <propfirst>'s for bomc  playful  whoop! yay for great days!"
"different aspects of life are all shooting in opposite directions  some with set paths others traveling arbitrary courses  it's like a twisted mix of comedy and tragedy  \anyways, bomc was a blast  i can't wait for tomorrow  oh and senior sunrise at 5 am tomorrow    nothin' like a bunch of sleepy, grumpy teenagers all gathering together in the wee hours of the morning   "
got the senior part     now where's the sunrise?!  playful 
"if you are open minded and optimistic, then you can start at the top, redefine the standards of the highest, and continue forward beyond your wildest of dreams "
"senior sunrise, nap, chill with <propfirst>  smile , bomc, then ice cream run and walk with <propmale>    excellent day? i vote yes  playful "
"to me, summer = ice cream for breakfast! what does summer = to you?"
"hmm so i just discovered that if you eat <propfemale>'s chili, then drink lemon lime powerade, it tastes like the smell of lysol   "
"they say life is beyond you're control  how you react to life, is completely your choice only "
