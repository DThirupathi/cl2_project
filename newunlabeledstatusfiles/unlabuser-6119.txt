"i appreciate the commentary that i read on facebook   because it makes me think   it helps me put reasoning behind the feelings i have when i read other peopleâ€™s opinions   \and i honor the passion from which it is spoken   and i think the intention behind that passion is genuine and, at least from the perspective of the speaker,   well-intentioned   "
"i have received much love in my life   i feel so fortunate to have been able to e playful erience this love from such a variety of souls   among them, i see examples of real people   in every walk   on every path   all trying to live a beautiful and gracious life   striving to understand and be understood        thank you   "
how about every time we want to bitch about the current administration's work ethic   policy   or bathroom schedule   we get out and spend the same amount of time volunteering as we do complaining   i think the world might benefit a little more from kind gesture than condescending banter   
i am really looking forward to sunday   
off to farmer's market

i love god   i love jesus   i would be happy to sit and discuss my beliefs    but these posts that say if you don't repost this   you are not a true christian or a true believer   or that you are denying something are a huge pet peeve to me   i will never repost something if you tell me i must   i will never send on a chain e-mail that says if i don't i will see repercussions   believe that to be true   
what a great day   
i have friends coming to visit   i have friends coming to sing   i have friends cooking wonderful treats   all orchestrated by my sweet beautiful love   what a great day!
what an exceptional night!
i miss my hard-workin' girl!
i love rain   i enjoy the way it feels   i enjoy the way it sounds   and i love the feelings of motivation and change and beginnings that i somehow always connect with a cloudy rain-filled day

i am grateful for a year of learning   understanding a little better who i am    of muddling through terrific sadness with some amount of grace   of finding depths in old friendships that make my heart swell with relief & thanksgiving   of discovering new friends with wonderfully interesting lives & perspective   and being able to share it with the most incredibly substantial and beautiful person i've ever known   
great game   still love my cowboys!!!
i've got so much to do today   and i don't know where to start!!
