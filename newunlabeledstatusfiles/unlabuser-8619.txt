it takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach  a human hair can hold 3kg  the length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb  the femur is as hard as concrete  a woman's heart beats faster then a man's  women blink 2x as much as men  we use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand  a woman has read this entire text  a man is still looking at his thumb  repost if this made you smile!

"unlike most of the time - why does the weather man have to be right this week??  i suppose that i can sacrifice the 5\ of fluffy new snow we got yesterday for the several feet of snow that is suppose to be falling in the mountains """
"to everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in tucson, may i offer this little tidbit of information: if guns kill people, then pencils misspell words, cars drive drunk, and spoons made oprah fat ! remember: hold the person accountable for their actions, not the means they chose to utilize!!! (reposted from another friend's status message  feel free to do the same )"

"an old man once said    there comes a time in life, when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it  you surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, and focus on the good  so love the people who treat you right, pray for the ones who don't  life is too short to be anything but happy  falling down is a part of life, getting back up is living ~ re-post if you agree"
