may survive after all   cannot believe how much better i feel than yesterday   hope this weather doesn't delay any flights tomorrow 
happy to be home!  almost back to 100%   put away christmas lights and ornaments   could use one more day before returning to work   oh well   sure enjoyed visiting with everyone 
at this rate schools won't be out until july!  although it is really nice to be looking out on this cold blowing snow instead of being out in it i hope it clears fast 
it has turned out to be such a beautiful day   when the wind dies down you can even do with just a fleece or heavy sweater   hard to stay home but the roads are really really really awful and quite dangerous still   good thing everybody (schools and government) are shut down to keep down the traffic 
wish they would stay shut down one more day so that the plows could get  more of the roads open   tomorrow's commute will be pretty awful i am sure 
brrrrr!  18 degrees outside    single digits close by     more snow coming at midday   what a day to look forward to!
"well, <propfirst> had his eyes fixed (lasek) this afternoon   hope it comes out perfect as he hopes   it took only a half hour and then they sent him home to go to bed with protective goggles   we will see how he feels when we awaken him for dinner   by then he should be able to see a big difference in his vision   he hopes   we hope too   seems like magic that they can do things like this now!"
"had a positively wonderful time at <propfemale> carpenter's 3rd birthday party   mama (<propfemale>) threw her a positively terrific party with lots of good food, a gorgeous cake, lots of presents, good company   doesn't get any better than that!  <propfemale> had a great time and was a wonderful hostess as well "
"had a wonderful evening celebrating <propfirst>'s 24th birthday with him, <propfemale> and <propfemale>!  good food, good company, presents and cake   doesn't get much better!"
t g i f   taking monday off!   3 days to get caught up   whooooeeeee!
miserable rainey day all day today   not an ideal saturday   had a good workout at the gym though so that's good   now on to work on the computers and turbotax!
looking forward to much better weather this weekend   may actually get to do stuff outside   time to hit the yard and get ready for summer!
wow!  what a nice day this has been   got a lot done in the yard   deleafing   liming   fertilizing   will have a nice spring when the grass starts growing and the flowers come up   the tulips are already poking up 
"got a fair amount done this weekend between raking, fertilizing, and liming the yard   got a pu load of mulch on the front flower bed   still lots to do but pretty good for one weekend  just in time since it is supposed to rain monday   weekend was so pretty   almost reached 80   even e-filed my taxes   now all i have to do is write the check and mail it in   groan "
grrrr! replaced the central ac last year   now they say i need a new furnace   not a happy outcome!
good news   don't need a new furnace after all   they found the water leak and it can easily be repaired!  hopefully it will be good for another few years at least!
great weekend!  fcps spring break this next week   should be good weather if a bit cool   hope it is warm in florida!
rain rain goaway   come again next week   rained all night and will be raining until noon   wdw let me change my backstage magic tour until tomorrow so all is well   wonder what is on at the movies in downtown disney

"backstage magic was very nice   two very informative tourguides took through selected areas at epcot, mk, hollywood studios, animal kingdom and some other backstage areas   we watched the parade at animal kingdom   day started off cool but turned out nice   good day!"
another beautiful day at orange lake   got in some pool time   couple of laps around the lazy river on the blue tubes   just a relaxing vacation day not at work or worrying about anything much at all 
home again   aaaaahhhh!  vacation is nice but it is nice to be home again too   had a nice breakfast with <propfemale> and samantha   dropped the car off for service   beautiful day outside   lots of sun but not too hat   nice end to a nice week

"is looking forward to father's day tomorrow!  after a nice lunch we plan a relaxing afternoon with <propfemale> in the sand box and pool   should be fun, fun, fun!"
