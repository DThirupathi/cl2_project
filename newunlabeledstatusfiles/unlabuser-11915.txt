"~?to all the unselfish moms out there who traded eyeliner for dark circles, salon haircuts for ponytails, long showers for quick showers, late nights for early mornings, designer bags for diaper bags, and wouldn't change anything  lets see how many moms re post this  moms who don't care       about whatever they gave up, instead love what they get in return  re post this if you love your kids "
my little girl britanee is going to register for her <propmale> year in high school today!! where did all this time go? it seems just like yesterday she was just starting grade school!! they grow up way too fast 
my baby boy cas is 3 today!!! it seems like it was just yesterday that i was carrying him around in my belly!! so happy birthday little one!!
i really hate it when i am backing up and i think there is nothing behind me and then bam!!! sad 
i really couldn't sleep last night because all i wondered was how injured does someone have to be from some stupid bully at school for the school to do anything about  it's been going on since the second day of school yet they say they need to catch the kid in the act before they can do anything  so this means my kids has to be hurt yet again but a teacher has to witness it for any actions to take place 
later i will be off to kid rock's halloween party!! i hope my costumes comes together like i have it visioned in my head!!!
i love my britty and her boyfrannnnd <propmale> english  getting ready to parrrrtayyy!
