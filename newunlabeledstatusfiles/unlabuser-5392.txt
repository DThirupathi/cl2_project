"last night was one of the most fun nights i have had in awhile with my best friends <propfemale>, <propfirst>, and <propfirst>!"
"jackass 3d,  funniest movie i have seen in a long time!"
"what an election night  congrats to <propfirst> branstad for beating culver and winning the race for iowa governor again  now even though republicans don't have senate control, they got back control of the house, which means no <propfemale> pelosi as speaker! so a good night for the republicans, which only makes us closer to stopping policies of obama!"
"democrats held a vote yesterday to raise taxes on small businesses, adding to the uncertainty thatâ€™s gripped american employers  a democrat tax hike would join other job-killing policies like obamacare & washingtonâ€™s spending spree as another barrier to job growth  we need to stop all the tax hikes & cut spending to help create jobs, & if the lame-duck congress wonâ€™t do it, the new house majority will in january "
loving the new lap top!
goodbye 111th united states congress! never going to miss the most corrupt congress in history  hopefully the 112th congress can get us down the right path  again  wishing speaker elect boehner and the newly elected representatives and senators the best 
looking forward to turning 18 in 5 days 
go steelers!
go steelers! hoping for super bowl win number 7!
"happy 100th birthday president <propfemale>, we will never forget you!"
