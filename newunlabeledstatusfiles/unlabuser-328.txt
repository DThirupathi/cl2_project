what the hell happened last nite where are my keys   
found his keys  
its hauling ass to get stuff done its a big weekend has had a productive day  i guess   
enjoys how quite and peaceful the snow falling is at night when he gets home from work    absolute silence is nice   and the only sound is snow cracking underneath his foot steps
had a really good day even though he didnt get much done  
beginning of this week looking forward at everything   it all seems so daunting and unlikely   
chemistry test in 15 minutes    oh god no   and statistics test is thursday studying for that starts directly after the test and off to work at 3 pm work till 11 45 pm    what a day   im excited enthusiastic and optimistic about whats ahead
watching nip tuck before class even though i should be doing statistics but some things just take precedence   
im so done with the week     my brain is like a flickering light from a hellish day of science anatomy chemistry and statistics   this flickering light   well i would  just like to turn it off for the night
glad i didnt go out last night time to go study chemistry for quiz tomorrow the most hellish week of the year so far is over 3 exams in 4 days 
had an amazing day with a few awkward moments    but what day doesn't have a few of those
had an amazing day with a few awkward moments    but what day doesn't have a few of those   i just need the steelers to pull out a win   this game is personal with big implications behind it
so frustrated   waste of time    just a waste    oh what a waste    oh well time to go to work and then out and about    
watching river runs through it drinking my favorite beer wailua wheat which only comes out once a year in the summer  somehow i found a 6 pack   im very happy to see what is next in life and optimistic about what tonight has to offer   i suddenly find myself going to ozmatli at the coercion of my brother  this will be the 5th time i've seen them but they put on a great show    im very excited
i wasnt very bright eyed or bushy tailed this morning and more disgruntled then cheery getting my test back
worst day ever wipe it off the books    move on to the next day
woke up for the sun rise today nice     ahh ive got no <propfemale> and i hate waiting for this day to end and the night to begin
time to pump the brakes for a bit couple weeks

"life has a scary way of repeating itself    sometimes to the day, years later   the same exact sequence of life events    then again some events are just predictable and some aren't   i guess its true    that you really never know whats coming for you   or what peoples true intentions are "
almost friday
almost friday to look forward to stats chemistry and anatomy and physiology and im done     almost there
mother of god    kappa sigma leaving without me to bozeman severely disappointing

what a difference a day makes    everything looks much clearer optimistic  
dollar sushi nite can make all the difference in the world  
skies the limit   
respect for law enforcement continues to grow as he is pulled over for things like tinted windows in the summer and no front license plate today    way to protect and serve we need more cops performing there jobs like that    
nothing to do     i guess do some work   
about ready to go kerouac for a bit    at least i feel like it 
so hard to get out of bed when its 7 degrees outside let alone get in your car and drive to school  then walk all the way across campus to class  my gosh   well im gonna run today for the first time in a long time  i wonder how thats gonna go    probably lose a minute off my average mile   go from a 6 05 pace to 7 30 pace    how exciting     and absolutely dispassionately defeating at the same time  ahh
is it to much to ask for a montana cal and florida win   today    montana has it wrapped up     florida    geeses and cal i just want to finish strong   i need this

going to chemistry already went to anatomy physiology lab exam didnt catch anybody cheating which is a good but probably would have made thing interesting   im always the watchful t a  s<propfemale>ying home tonite study for finals last week and then off to az  this semester will stay behind me thank god its over now lets just see how the grades   so i dont have to to repeat any of these hellish classes damn im late for school
statistics on my mind and thats about it    all day
's voice is nearly gone   and cracking from yelling during every offensive play for appalachian state    
is drinking coffee at 1030 at night    studying till hopefully 230 am and getting up at 6 15 take practice test for stats and to be ready for final at 8am

where am i gonna watch the game tonight?  hmm need to figure that out?
time to get new phone screen smashed but still works sporadically
driving to whitefish tonight    and asking myself   why drive back to missoula?
downloaded eminem cd now im driving to whitefish  at least new music makes time go by a little faster    its not the drive there thats so bad its coming back   
"30 minutes after saying\so sad leaving whitefish wish i could stay ill be back in 3 weeks     couple hours of a day wasn't enough\"" im in whitefish for two days stuck   did get to see freinds and now im in arizona"""
wow wow     what   
feels like having this week away from everything in arizona    is exactly what he needed 
"just wants to check his grades    damn fees   but looking for a steelers win    <propmale> loss, jets loss, jacksonville loss and a nice sunday for myself"
start school tomorrow   wow what a winter break
sitting on facebook in class   putting my money to work
test    test    should start the studying  
im ready for spring semester   spring semester=big check=skiing in whitefish
yeahh    half way done   huh   winter session kicks ass in a lot of different ways    i know tyce will agree with me on that  
"winter session has ended and spring semester starts monday   glad im nice 'n' fresh, and fully at 100% for spring semester  after that 6 week break it usually takes a while for me to get going  i wont have that problem this year    and receiving an a grade takes a little pressure off of my gpa for spring semester   so im glad i got an a   now where are the checks at? i want my money   "
is so glad his car is paid off after six years  
same old thing  
i dont ever want to hear anyone ever say that an apple in the morning is supposed to wake you up better then coffee   i did both this morning apple first  just isn't the same as a strong cup of coffee   i will never give up coffee    ever
"just one more class to go   on this awful monday, wednesday, friday   class schedule setup "
is shocked that everyday has been a surprise so far this year     when something goes bad something good shows up soon after    so now what? bad or good guess it doesnt matter if it all equals out in the end anyways   
7 oclock on a saturday just not fun
likes the snow until its time to drive
"is very happy looking straight across from him at his two mandolins( 5 string electric and the 8 string acoustic) after working on them, by putting on new strings, and doing a minor cleaning on the instruments which were severely lacking there deserved proper amount of attention and appreciation   im glad there fixed and shiny    looking the way they should  its such a nice view"
wow    and it ended up being nothing at all   so i had 3 options   one of them involved keeping my word   and i go with that one    and that meant doing nothing apparently     geese   time to do homework salvage something to take away thats positive for the weekend   besides being healthy and practicing hobbies 
another day thats gonna be wonderful starting out with b & g    4 hours of sleep   
and big decision is what to do with unused forresters ball ticket  ?
its just chemistry   thats it
"undecided, undefined   undisturbed yet undermined  relocated not retired  reprimanded and rewind  mystified and misshapen, misinformed but not mistaken  reinvented, redefined, rearranged but not refined  unrelenting, understroked  undeterred yet unprovoked  reinvented, redefined  rearranged but not refined  mystified and misshapen, misinformed but not mistaken undecided, undefined "
organic chemistry test at 12 is nothing fun and ending up on the hood of a car walking to class isnt very fun either
new boondock saints better be good
one class and a bunch of work
alarm needs to start going off in the morning   killing me for school   set it for 6 am so i can study for organic chem exam and then wake up at 9 am    is like a punch in the gut   but ill still kill it    just because i have to   and always do
a lot of work is what i need to do and a lot of luck is what i need in conjunction
i would be more empathetic   if i wasnt so apathetic at the moment   and over the last month 
"  is wondering if he will wake up in time for skiing at snow bowl tomorrow?    730 am thats gonna be rough  loves this new app program that plays (by putting a voice to what anyone types or has typed)  this program may be archaic but its oh so good for school   now i can copy and paste a chapter of chemistry just listen to it all   its so much better  well its a change of pace, and thats just appreciated right now   "
as far as skiing   well that didnt happen so    if you dont go skiing theres always studying and watching college basketball  yup
the last nip tuck is on tonite i cant believe it  
finally walked away from a chem exam confident that i did well
"life's good     every moment right now is fun, new, and just an opportunity for me to be positive and happy  so how long will it last   ill worry about that later   "
12 pages and done 
"nice weather for spring break and not worrying how organic chem exam went, or his bio exam today, whatever happens, it seems like i always end up good in the end  especially when there is so much to look forward to and to be thankful for everything that is going on in my life right now  i love spring and its time to get outside and study  its fun and im excited about my attempted week away from stress"
"some how, some way i got tickets to telluride colorado phish shows which are scheduled a week before hornings hide out and yeah i got those as well   somehow the lottery system worked for me both times   i dont know how it happened but it did  just a lot of luck"
"just trying to make it to telluride colorado, which coincidently coincides with his one and only month break from school  if <propmale> m  <propfirst> can make it to august and summer school over   he will be happy and thinks it sounds fantastic   until then, well he just wants everything to go well and be done with next four months  thats all   "
to much to fast   maybe?
defintely

"when the door handle breaks off your car, first thing in the morning as you try and open the door   ahh well it should be a sign that it should at least be a snow day cause that sucks "
