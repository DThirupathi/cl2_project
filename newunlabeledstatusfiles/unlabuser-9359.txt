"last night a 2 yr old boy was hit and killed by a car on rt 125 in bowdoin, chasing a ball  it is said that the child is from lewiston area and was just visiting relatives and that the relative chased and caught the child but lost grip  my thoughts are with the family of the child and the driver  if anyone knows anything please let me know  saddest story i have heard in a long time "
wth has this world come to  with mothers who would rather be sticking needles into there body then being with there children  rather be high then be loved  then parents who cant watch there own children in a yard and hit by an ongoing vehicle  killed while under adult supervision  then mothers having children and then beating an infant   a 20 day old baby was beatin by an ignorant ass chick from richmond  wtf????
if you dont like what i post dont read it  i know how i feel about it  i dont mind if others post how they feel but attacking someone because they posted how they feel is bullshit    i didnt direct anything to anyone  stay off my <propfemale> if you dont like what i say     period   grow the fuck up
"this is the <propfemale> of the mother who beat her 20 day old infant  she broke the baby's arm, broke her ribs, choked her til blue, hit her and gave her a black eye  she was sentenced to 2 5 years in prison   not long enough!!!! feel free to go to her <propfemale> and leave as much \love\"" as you can """
