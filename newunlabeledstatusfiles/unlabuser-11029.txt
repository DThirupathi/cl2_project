i am here 
thanx  <propfirst> made me do it 
"you know its truly boring without <propmale>  he's camping since thursday and i'm bored  <propfemale> is a handful usually, but now she's asking where's daddy?"
everything is good  <propmale> is back from camping and <propfemale> is a handful  she starts swimming soon 
cloe is going swimming today  i'm so excited 
"<propfemale> got the sniffles yesterday  no swimming  she is better today, but still congested "
"<propfemale> took jello i made last night and smeared it everywhere  she woke me up as a smurff  some of you will laugh, but i'm not there yet  i'm pissed  blue everywhere  even the walls  what do i have to do really beat her this time  she doesn't listen "
okay i've made red jello  hopefully she won't be a horrorflick victim next time i see her 
i really really dislike appliances  or is it that they hate me  i mean really!
now i'm sick  now thats just not fair 
"still sick  never get sick  then in the end of summer i feel yucky  <propfemale>, thank god, is all better  this would suck if we were sick at the same time "
see that i am a fire storm 
"i am so tired, but if i sleep during the day i can't sleep at night  i know i'm whinning, but when your sick isn't that the time to whine  i even have the whinny voice down perfectly"
"<propfemale> went down for her nap like she was waiting for me to tell her it was nap time  she never does that  she fights sleep, like its her mortal enemy or something "
mortal enemy is back  two hour fight to sleep 
almost all better  i feel like a person again 
"it really is so wierd to have no sense of smell  <propfemale> made a huge mess of smelly lotion and i cleaned it up with no problem  litter boxes, throwing trash, no problem  the only done side is i don't smell the mess shes making and then its too late "
happy labor day! hope no one is actually laboring!
i know i complain a lot 
would you believe she took the tea pitcher and poured it on the couch this morning? thanks <propmale> for leaving the fridge unlocked 
i'm stressed 
may i be the first to tell the world that a bid for a new house has been accepted  translation   we are buying a new house  its 45 day escrow so at the end of october i will be moving to new house  a beautiful 4 bedroom 2 5 bath  two stories and it has blue carpet 
paperwork done until they ask for more   lol 
"my daughter is smart, brave and a trouble maker  but we love her "
i hate waiting!
<propfemale> said quesidilla today 
<propfemale> has a doll that she calls her baby and she is being very protective of her today  it is very cute 
"if you hated your kids doctor, but you had no one to ask how would you find a new one? he doesn't seem to care about us at all  his nurses make too many mistakes and are dumb  where do i go to find a better one?"
found new doctor  she seems very nice and her nurses sound good

one month to go  everything is looking really good  i am so much healthy this time 
would it be annoying to say that tomorrow it will be 20 days until she's due ? i might be impatient for her to get here 
my wonderful husband made me french toast in bed and sang me happy birthday  <propfemale> told me to eat in the kitchen and sang me twinkle twinkle little <propfemale>  it was really sweet and fun

"had a thunder storm last night and i got to be awake for it  not my idea, but the lightning woke <propfemale> several times  if its not one kid its the other keeping me awake for it "
let's see how creative my facebook friends are  type a 1 word comment about me using the third letter of your first name  it can only be one word  then copy and pastethis so i can leave a word about you 
"kids are so weird  <propfemale> refuses to eat any of the ham i made unless it is the top of the whole thing  not the skin, but is picking strips off the top  hard to describe, but fun to watch "
"sleep is so elusive  both my girls are asleep and i have a huge headache, but no sleep "
its going to be one of those days  think positive next week is thanksgiving! one of the best holidays!
"new game: change your profile picture to your favorite cartoon from when you were a kid  the goal of this game is to not see a human picture on facebookbut an invasion of childhood memories until monday  play and pass along! (yes, for some of us - this will totally date us)"
i am going to be away from the computer for awhile so i wanted to say it now  happy thanksgiving!!!!!
a beautiful snow man! what fun! brrr  its cold though 
"i've carried children within my body  slept with babies on my chest  i've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts  i've been puked on, peed on, and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair  but i wouldn't have it any other way  my body isn't magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see a mom, and there is    no greater honor    or blessing!! post this as your status if you are proud to be a mom!"
"it's daughter week!! if you have a beautiful daughter that you love more than you can describe, copy and paste this to your wall  your daughter will hold your hand for a little while, but will hold your heart for a lifetime!"

what a day    
"<propfemale> likes squash!!! it has taken two months to get her to eat solid food and i have tried everything twice  i have been giving her the gerber graduates and she'll eat those, but its not enough  finally tonight she is eating squash  its cute she is sipping it "
"<propfemale> is standing up on her own and moved away from the couch trying to walk  of course she fell, but laughed and tried again  its crazy how fast they grow "
on my way to the beach tomorrow  avila in the rain! i can't wait 
my poor baby has a fever of 102  we took her to the doctor and she might have the flu or an ear infection or a bladder infection  i wish they could give better answers  if she's not better by wednesday back we go  until then <propmale> and infant tylenol 
"i loved you the minute i heard you were coming  i loved you the minute you were born; then i saw your face and fell in love some more  you were only a minute old, but i knew i would die for you and to this day i still would  when you choose to have a child, you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body  put this on your status if you have children you love more than life "
how frustrating  i bought a cd with my pictures i just developed and it won't read on my computer  it keeps saying its not responding when i click on the tab 
"so i was on the toilet this morning, eating an awesome fried egg sandwich and   what? you think there's something wrong with eating in the bathroom? did that gross you out? then why do people suggest breastfeeding mothers feed their babies in the bathroom? if you're a fan of parents and babies rights, i dare you to put this up as your status"
