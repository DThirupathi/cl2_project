"soooo bored!!!!!!! i think too much when i'm bored, and that's never a good thing for me!! s"
anybody else think that it's a bad idea to keep a 4th grader and a 1st grader out of school for a full week just to go to the beach?  maybe it's just me????
"sooo bored, geez there's nothing to do but to do nothing   if that even makes sense "
really do you want to know what's on my mind?? i don't think you do
"hmmm, i don't understand?"
just a thought; strength is nothing more than how well you hide the pain inside
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm????????????
"i'm not supposed to be scared of anything,\but i don't know where i am\i wish that i could move but i'm exhausted\and nobody understands (how i feel) \\i'm tryin' hard to breathe now,\but there's no air in my lungs \there's no one here to talk to\and the pain inside is making me numb  \\i try to hold this under control,\they can't help me, cause no one knows "
"im so tired of this, i just want to give up"

the girl who seemed unbreakable~broke the girl who seemed so strong~crumbled the girl who always laughed it off~cried and the girl who would never stop trying~finally gave up
what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you; what am i supposed to say when i'm choked up and you're ok; i'm falling to pieces
what a wonderful day its been~inventory to start it off next comes my first ass ripping from the dm then comes the conference call that only 6 stores decided to call in for   oh i dont think im gonna like this job so much sad 
"here goes another day, wonder whats gonna go wrong this time"
*cause when i close my eyes and drift away i think of you and everythings ok*
"*im broken like promise, im shattered like a dream, im broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see, im broken like a record i sing the same old song, im broken like the heart of a girl thats run away from love too long*"
"why is it im scared to death of what i want?  dang it a stupid text scared the crap outta me, i dont know what to do"
ughhh
i am in need of some motivation today!
"*one of these days i will have the courage to go out and get the one i want i just hope its not too late, for my heart shall be broken*"
"hmmm i think that i think too much, but when i think about not thinking it only makes me think more about why i think about him?"
"*so close no matter how far,  couldnt be much more from the heart, forever trust in who we are, and nothing else matters*"
*i close my eyes and i see your face i hear your voice i know your taste*
well im here bout to start the undoing of the last 10 years of my life         
its been a long hard day think im gonna go to sleep now
good things come to people who are patient enough to wait for them! trust me i know it just keeps getting better and better smile )))))
"***it's 4 surprise 3 and i cant sleep without you next to me i toss and turn like the sea, if i drown tonight bring me back to life, breathe your breath in me, the only thing that i still believe in is you, if you only knew***"
"be patient and fearlessly persue your dreams, who knows you might get what and who you always wanted!!!"
hmmm thinkin i want to           
"**our houses are protected by the good lord and a gun, and you might need 'em both if you show up here not welcome son, our necks are burnt our roads are dirt and our trucks aint clean, the dogs run loose we smoke we chew we fry everything, out here, way out here**"
"ha least i have one kid that takes after me, my 3 year old baby girl can pick out any generation camaro from all the other cars!!! thats mommy's girl  smile ))) lol!"
"*can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars, i could really use a wish right now*"
today is one of those days where i just want to be by myself and not talk to nobody 
"i got ice in veins, blood in my eyes, hate in my heart, love in my mind, i seen nights full of pain, days are the same you keep the sunshine save me the rain, i search but never find hurt but never cry, i work and forever try but im cursed so nevermind        so i pick the world and drop it on your fuckin head      "
"too much sun for me, oh how this is not going to turn out good for me sad "
"if i leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me? well i must be traveling on now, cause theres too many places ive got to see   if i stay here with you now, things just couldnt be the same  so i'm as free as a bird now, and this bird you cannot change   "
"i wish that some certain people would realize that this is my life and i'm actually starting to do what i want with it and i'm not going to stay here and pretend to be happy like i've done for the past 10 years, so suck it up!!!!!!!!"
*im gonna love you like nobody loves you and i'll earn your trust makin memories of us*
"*heaven help the fool who did her wrong its too late too bad shes too far gone, he shoulda thought of that before he left her all alone, if shes lonely now she wont be lonely long *"
i wonder why is it that some men cant seem to realize what they have or could have until they push us so far away that we dont want to give them anything at all   if they would just open their eyes they could have the world right in front of them!
"i've always been the loser so i'm debating on selling the camaro, giving up on a house and giving up on the one person that makes me happy, because the way it's looking i'm never going to have any of that anyways "
"i give up, my life has always sucked and i dont ever see it getting any better, so guess ill settle for being nothing"
guess id rather hurt than feel nothing at all
"~and i just cant keep livin this way, so startin today i'm breaking outta this cage, i'm standing up i'm gonna face my demons, i'm manning up i'm gonna hold my ground, i've had enough, now i'm so fed up, time to put my life back together right now!!!~ smile "

"there are just too many things, to e playful lain, when it rains, \guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain  \but i can't pretend there ain't, i ain't placin' any blame, \i ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint "
"you know it kinda hurts my feeling that everybody is sooooo happy for my ex that we split up and nobody gives a shit about me   i know that i'm not like him, i'm not skinny and pretty and priss up for everybody but he has all these girls that are so happy for him and has so many to choose from and nobody wants fatass <propfirst>  its really kinda depressing sad  and everybody wonders why im a bitch all the time"
its friday and thats bout it
"we touch i feel a rush\we clutch it isnt much\but its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us\its lust its torturous\you must be a sorceress cause you just\did the impossible\gain my trust dont play games itll be dangerous\if you fuck me over\cause if i get burnt imma show you what its like to hurt\cause i been treated like dirt before ya\and love is evil\spell it backwards i'll show ya"
be good or be good at it    
i have no respect for irresponsible people! if getting drunk and partyin is more important than doing your job maybe you shouldnt be able to have a job that so many other responsible people need  just my opinion!
how about instead of a poke feature we have a punch in the face feature? could use that some days 
man wanted  no e playful erience necessary! willing to train wink 
don't confuse my smile for liking you  it's like when a kid smiles   it only means i know what i did and you haven't figured it out yet  baaahahaha

"whatever it is, i didn't do it, and you cant prove anything        unless      of course you liked it, and in that case, yes i did it, and i might just do it again  lmao"
"if you find yourself asking for whole coleslaw aka cabbage, guacamoles aka avacados, or where you might find the fresh potatoes, maybe you dont need to go grocery shopping   just sayin'"
"maybe it is true that we don't know what we had until we lost it, but maybe it's also true that we don't know what we're missing until we find it?!?!"
"i might be a smart ass, but smart ass is good ass and good ass is hard to find!"
"it sucks when you you can't describe how you're feeling inside, you just know it hurts, and it freakin sucks because i'm so tired of hurting, i just want somebody to make it all go away sad "

"losing my daddy has been the hardest thing i've ever had to deal with, and we catch ourselves asking y bad things always happen to good people when the reality is he just got the biggest reward of his life  we just don't look at it that way!!!"
"so close no matter how far;couldn't be much more from the heart;forever trusting who we are;and nothing else matters;never opened myself this way\life is ours we live it our way;all these words i don't just say;trust i seek and i find in you;every day for us something new;open mind for a different view;and nothing else matters;never cared for what they do;never cared for what they know;but i know"

"i'm not suposed to be scared of anything, but i don't know where i am\i wish that i could move but i'm exhausted and nobody understands (how i feel)\i'm trying hard to breathe now but there's no air in my lungs\there's no one here to talk to and the pain inside is making me numb\i try to hold this under control\they can't help me 'cause no one knows"
"alas, the onion you are eating is someone elses water <propfemale>"
"well i wasnt dreaming of a white christmas, but obviously someone was    oh well its pretty and the kids like it"
"lay off of it people, u do not need to rush to the store, its not that bad out there, geez"
"it hurts but i never show, this pain you'll never know, if only u can see just how lonely and how cold and frostbite i've become, my backs against the wall, when push comes to shove, i just stand up and scream f*@# em all"
"i search but never find, hurt but never cry\i work and forever try, but i'm cursed so never mind\and it's worse but better times seem further and beyond\the top gets higher, the more that i climb"
im breaking and absolutly nobody gives a damn! fml
"wondering how much a person can take before they just completely shut down physically and mentally, because i'm sure i'm pretty damn close"
"maybe its time to change and leave it all behind, i've never been one to walk alone i've always been scared to try, so y does it feel so wrong to reach for something more, and wanna live a better life, what am i waiting for? cause nothing says the same maybe its time to change "
"feelin weak and weary walkin thru this world alone, everything they say every word of it cuts me to the bone and i bleed, now ive got something to say but now ive got nowhere to turn, it feels like ive buried underneath all the weight of the world, i try to hold this under control, they cant help me cause no one knows"
"gotta get thru the next two weeks without killing anybody! the third week of <propfirst> itll all be ok      maybe, then again maybe not, who knows"
"they say that god never gives u more than u can handle, but i dont believe that anymore  if only people really saw what i have on me maybe i wouldnt constantly hear them say its gonna be ok, and its all gonna get better    bs"
i think i've made my mind up  wink 
"*cause u do what u gotta do, and know what u know, u <propfemale> on till u cant <propfemale> on, and u learn to let go*"
"*so why in the world do i feel so alone, nobody but me i'm on my own, is there anyone out there, who feels the way i feel, if there is let me hear just so i know i'm not the only one*"
"*so u can keep knockin' but wont knock me down, no love lost, no love found*"
really wish i knew what was going on?????
"really???? these people are gettin ready to see <propfirst> mad, and <propfirst> is not a very nice person mad!!!!!"
"*yesterday is just a dream i dont remember, tomorrow, still a hope i've yet to endure*"
"*and everything i can remember, as f***ed up as it may seem,  and consequences that are rendered, i stretch myself beyond my means*"
"*what you hide inside i see, theres a scar thats always gonna be,  theres a past in everyone, you can't undo you can't outrun*"
"really wish these people would quit whining and protesting because their kids had to go to school yesterday, we dont get a day off for being white!!! stfu"
"hilarious is all ive got to say, if u think im racist because i said the naacp needs to shut up and send their kids to school,  im not sorry "
"*i cant tell u what it really is, i can only tell u what it feels like, and right now its a steel knife in my windpipe, i cant breathe but i still fight, while i can fight as long as the wrong feels right its like im in flight*"
"*maybe im a dreamer, maybe im misunderstood, maybe your not seeing the side of me u should, maybe im crazy, maybe im not the only one, maybe im just out of touch, maybe ive just had enough*"
"*its not easy being me, in fact most people couldnt even begin to do it*"
i am now officially in debt but its worth it!!!! yayyy i got my house smile )))))
"*you know a dream is like a river ever changin as it flows, and a dreamer's just a vessel that must follow where it flows, trying to learn from whats behind u and never knowin whats in store, makes each day a constant battle to stay between the shores*"
"so close no matter how far, couldnt be much from the heart, forever trust in who we are and nothing else matters =*("
"for some reason ive got the feeling its gonna be a really bad day, emotionally \*so close no matter how far couldnt be much more from the heart, forever trust in who we are, and nothing else matters=*("
"*i took a <propmale>, i took a shot, and you might think im bulletproof but im not, you took a swing, i took it hard, and down here from the ground i see who you are*"
"*maybe one day you'll understand, maybe one day you'll understand love* until that day right here i stand, i stand in the dark and wait for the sunÂ¥"
so i was thinking that i probly shouldnt put what im thinking on here because the first sign that there was a problem with what i was thinking was that i was thinkingÂ¥
*cause when i close my eyes im somewhere with you*
come on friday        ha ive been at work for 30 <propfemale>utes only 39 hours and 30 <propfemale> to go  sad 
"*there might have been a time when i'd give myself away, once upon a time i didnt give a damn, but now here we are so whataya wasnt from me*"
"*tryin not to fall but im already there, tryin to hold my head up gasping for air, you take my breath when i hear your name, its real to me but am i just your game*"
"*dont u worry you'll find urself follow ur heart and nothing else, maybe i've forgotten all the things i miss somehow i know theres more to life than this, ive seen ur face a thousand times every day weve been apart i dont care about the sunshine yeah, all these words i dont just say and nothing else matters*"
"*so you think you can tell heaven from hell, blue sky from pain, can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? a smile from a veil? do you think you can tell*Â¥"
"i look back on my life and how ive lived\i cant take the hurt and pain and all ive hid\the things ive done, seen and who ive become\ive learned i cant trust or love anyone\i dont know myself or who im supposed to be\i only wish that someone would see\im lost all alone with one to help me thru\i just want to be happy know myself and start over new"
"*so go on and scream, scream at me so far away, i wont be broken again, ive got to breathe i cant keep going under*"
"if i'm smiling, you might want to consider what you've done wrong   or what i'm planning to do to get you back  laugh "
priceless is seeing <propfemale> run into my closed sliding glass door at full speed hahahhahahhahhahahh     
"*now that i know what im without, you cant just leave me, breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life*"
"*i should let you fade away but that just wouldnt be me    i wont forget you baby even though i could, i wont forget you baby even though i should*"
i love when you send out an email to the district to collect info that you are told to collect and you get replies that ask y u need to know! geez im just doing what i was told to do people
"i created the sound of madness, i wrote the book on pain somehow im still here to e playful lain that the darkest hour never comes in the night*"
"*i move on like a sinners prayer, letting go like a levee breaks, walk away as if i dont care, learn to shoulder my mistakes*"
"*well its a windin road when your in the lost and found, your a lover i'm a runner, we go round n round, and i love you but i leave you i don't want you but i need you, you know its you who calls me back here*"

"*oh take your time dont live too fast, troubles will come and they will pass      forget your lust for the <propmale> mans gold, all that you need is in your soul*"
"when bad things happen to you, you have two choices, let it make u stronger or whine about how bad ur life is and have a pity party; i can guarantee ur not the only one that bad things happen to, so suck it up!!!!!!!!"
"really this is what i get for trying to be nice, shoulda known better!"

"*and i feel all this pain, stuffed it down its back again, and i lie here in bed,  all alone i can't mend, and i feel tomorrow will be ok*"
"*i got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes, hate in my heart, love in my mind, i seen nights full of pain days are the same, u keep the sunshine save me the rain, i search but never find, hurt but never cry*"
"*my eyes are open wide and by the way i made i thru the day, i watch the world outside and by the way i'm leaving out today    tell my mother tell my father i have done the best i can to make them realize this is my life, i hope they understand, i'm not angry i'm just saying, sometimes goodbye is a second <propmale> *"
"*if today was your last day would you make your <propfirst> by mending a broken heart, you know its never too late to shoot for the stars, regardless of who you are, so do whatever it takes, cause you can't rewind a moment in this life, let nothing stand in your way, cause the hands of time are never on your side*"
"never cared for what they say, never cared for games they played, never cared for whay they do never cared for whay they know and i know*"
"*i walk a lonely road the only one that i have ever known, dont know where it goes but its only me and i walk alone*"
"*so close no matter how far, couldnt be much more from the heart, forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters*  crying "
"*the feelings gone theres nothing there to lift me back up into the world i know, cause now again i find myself so far down away from the sun*"

*take me as i am; im not broken; the pieces of my life are not tokens;  i want to let you know im still learning; how to love again and stop hurting*
"everyone's pointing their fingers\always condemning me\and nobody knows what i believe\i believe\and i'm staring down the barrel of a 45,\i'm swimming through the ashes of another life\there's no real reason to accept the way things have changed\staring down the barrel of a 45"
"*theres something bout this time of year, that spins my head around,  takes me back makes me wonder*"
"*i dont want to live to waste another day underneath the shadow of mistakes i made, cause i feel like i'm breaking inside*"
i allow myself to be used to kill the pain inside
"*and love is evil, spell it backwards i'll show you*"
"*i caught a chill and its still frozen on my skin, i think about why i'm alone, by myself*"
*how do i live without the one i love? time still turns the pages of the book its burned*

"*a life to heal the broken heart with all that it could, lived a life so endlessly, saw beyond what others see*"
"*i wanna heal, i wanna feel, like i'm close to something real, i wanna find something i've wanted all along*"
"some search never finding a way, before long they waste away"
hoping for the best but always e playful ecting the worst
"what it takes, who i am, where i've been, belong, you can't be something you're not, be yourself, by yourself"
"no one knows me, im cold and alone, maybe one day youll see, i was always where u belong"
"im no the one whos so far away, when i feel the snake bite into my veins, never did i want to be her again, and i dont remember why i came"
"i know what it takes to move on, i know how it feels to lie, all i want to do, is trade this life for something new, holding on to what i havent got"
"*as time went by faith in u grew, so one things left for me to do, finish you, i feel it burn inside, burn like the rising sun*"
"*keep my feet on the ground, keep my head in the clouds, electrified by the sound, comes from the down*"
"*i can see just fine with you in my life, there by my side as it starts to fade*"
"*and i said <propmale> save me ive been feeling so alone, i keep waiting for u but u never come, is this in my head i dont know what to think* haha"
"*cause now im stronger than yesterday, now its nothing but my way, my loneliness aint killin meno more, im stronger*"
