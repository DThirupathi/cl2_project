â€œevery man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad â€� --<propfirst> wadsworth longfellow--
"â€œwhile money can't buy happiness, it certainly lets you choose your own form of miseryâ€�"
"â€œif a man insisted always on being serious, and never allowed himself a bit of fun and relaxation, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it â€�"
"â€œin times of great stress or adversity, it's always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive â€�"
