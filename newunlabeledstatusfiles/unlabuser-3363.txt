"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper softly\in her ear  \\while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man \flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is  \\while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away  \while you make your woman cry, there's a man stealing her smiles "
senior year is much more annoying than i e playful ected it to be   
"please\put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish\for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease\nor a choice people who are gay are not looking for a cure but \acceptance and equal rights will you make it your status for at least \            one hour? promote love & acceptance not hate  ?"
"to my fellow facebook friends!\what words would you use to desribe me(otherwise than \quiet\"")\",44 laugh d58f7da0dd9a8f86e76cc66b1b7f,"every person has 1000 wishes, a cancer patient only has one: to get better  i know that 97% won't post this as their status - be one of the 3% and post this as your status  do it for at least an hour, for those who have died of cancer or who are still fighting"
