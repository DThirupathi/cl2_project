finally have chosen to assign myself a facebook; what have i done?
i plan to put up some music soon       i'm betting i will be here more often
it has never dawned on me until i came on here       that the choices i've made could in no way possibly distance myself from my friends any further than they already have 
the university of michigan has done a lot to convince me that i am wholly incapable of making the right decisions when necessary  i never feel like i have enough information or any good information to make the right choices anymore  i need to work harder on organizing my work and my mind into this       my god this has been so hard on me 
"i now have someone to work with on physics 140, the easist of my classes so far  i will be meeting him every thursday at 9 surprise 0 p m  i hope this works out well along with the other study group i'm in for physics on sunday "
"update       with a cool head, let's see what i can actually do about this "
"i have orientation at work at 9 am today (june 1st) yet i cannot sleep  i am not looking forward to it even though i should \\other issues are also bothering me, unfortunately though they will have to be addressed later once this day is over  hopefully i can reach the people who need to be contacted and this will all be dealt with "
"it seems no one really reads the reports i post here  oh well, not my job to report the news "
a new news report will be posted soon  i found something on russiantelevision  i kinda like this foreign news agency 
more news soon  i've not found more interesting or important stuff yet 
"\because i must\"" -me to a person whom replied i did not need to get the door for them """
"phone won't charge anymore  i'll see how else to make calls  i didn't know, so my phone, while on the charger all day, was actually still dying "
"time to check out all my work in environment, history, political science, and astronomy"
i'll try to upload pictures of the laptop  so far everything is working out great  kinda hard to get used to windows 7 though 
"minus 4 degrees out  coldest it's been so far this winter  it's getting close to what it was like my first year here, but it's still warmer than usual from what i can tell "
"it's 35 out, and it feels much warmer today  then again it was -11 yesterday  weather is kinda weird "
well among the things that make me happy are states who do not remember the precedents set by the us supreme court  i can't wait to see how this nullification issue is dealt with 
"went to the orchestra last night  had nothing to do with stalin, but shostakovich's 10th symphony was awesome "
"to paraphrase neo, \snow"," lots of snow \""\"e2db465a5a728b1eec0dbad5c99e74a7,"http annoyed  en wikipedia org wiki 2011_bahraini_protests\\it will be a bloody and uphill battle for most of the people within these nations now  these governments have seen the downfall of neighboring governments to revolutionary people and will be determined to prevent it from happening to them "
we've got hail and snow at the same time now  we've got awesome weather barreling through here 
not that long ago it was 55  now it's another snowstorm and it's 3 degrees out  i'm so exhausted 
headed to the bus at 3 surprise 0 pm and i'm going to new york  let's hope the weather lets up and i can get there on time 
i need to relax on posting these random articles 
"it went from 60 degrees last weekend, to being 11 this weekend  i can barely take it "
"if anyone can help me find a couple of free peer reviewed journal articles for energy in <propfemale>, i'd be so freaking happy  all of them cost over $30 from what i found online  i'll be headed to the ford library, though searching there would take forever "
"live from the very computer lab i'm in, apparently there are no land-line servers to logon to; however, the wireless server is fine  hmm "
right now i am way too busy being awesome 
"i'm wondering if anyone else got this e-mail because i think it is a prank  somehow i received an e-mail at 1 smile 0 this morning from myself to myself from 2031  i need to see if someone might have hacked my e-mail to mess with me, because that could mean they have more of my stuff "
"my day has been exhausting  i'm not sure what to do for the rest of the day  i at least finally have exactly one <propmale> thing to due and plenty of time to do it  though i'm not sure if i can come to grips to keep going today  oh well, i'm going to lay down "
i finally finished       the blasted political science paper  now to figure out what else i want to do 
"i've gotten sick again       this weather  it may not be that much better in texas, but i just got to get out of here as soon as i can "
"last monday: 73 degrees f\this monday: 33 degrees f\\that's a 40 degree shift over 7 days  i mean it may not seem that dramatic but, i'm feeling it right now and it feels awful "
"i got a $2 <propmale> in the mail from the university       i'm wondering what on e<propmale>h to do with it because i basically have a piece of <propmale>, yet at the same time i have a <propmale> far more useful than a single since nothing here except for the hidden vending machines cost less than a $1 25"
