"is tired of conspiracy theorists  crop circles were proven to be made by people with nothing better to do, if 911 was a government attempt to take over peopleâ€™s lives, then why havenâ€™t they done it when bush was in office? if obama is the antichrist (which being an agnostic, i can't really say i believe in it), then why hasnâ€™t he accomplished anything yet with a low popularity?"

"its offical, i will live in providence next semester!"
