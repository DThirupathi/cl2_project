"gray is not a boring color   think of a dolphin as it swims gracefully in the ocean, a gray horse as it runs powerfully across a field, and some tornados are gray and they are so not boring they are terrifying!  i know a little boy (<propmale>) that thinks under (gun metal gray) man-holes covers that's where the ninja turtles live   imagination and innocence   think before you say something is boring!!"
