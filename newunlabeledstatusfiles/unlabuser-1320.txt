"the situation seems to get worse with each piece of information    oh lord plz oh plz hear my weeping   its hurting my heart, soul   the confusion fear and above all change"
"i pray this isnt the sacrifice that i have to make to satisfy god  obedience is better than sacrifice   but god also called is only to sacrifice like <propmale> commanded to offer <propmale>, and <propmale> his dignity with a prostitute 4 a wife, is my heart on that altar?"
"wanting to enjoy my day even though i missed some important things i thought, either way it is all greatly looked @ as i go out in da world to find hidden treasures yet again  there is none righteous no not one "

wat is da purpose for me to do wat i do and it gets shot down everytym!? im about to quit and jus say fgorget it and move on  its easier to handle me anyway
still wake i huess i'll allow god to speak 2 me even though it seems like its a brick wall in front of me

"feeling sick, aggravated, trembling wit da shakes, gettin angry, hurting from head to toe and wanting some rest  ugh cold weather!!!!"
"getting ready to work on da resume  im taking a step so that god may bless it i pray  i have been thinking abt how interesting life is when it comes down to the petty things  2 1 it is small 2 another it is big, who is 2 judge the difference in the 2  a wise man once said; 'don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things'"
well abt 2day  it is what it is and i am ready for it  i might not feel to good but this is small to me  there are bigger mountains to climb so this hill is just a resting period til i get to the bottom of what seems impossible
"im n a position right now dat makes me wonder if i am equipped wit da rite stuf  i've bn beat down emotionally, physically, & mentally  all i have left is the spritual reserve & i can say it is runnin' lo  i should have had it full so when days lik this happen i would b prepared  u can't get prepared for a hurricane after da damages  when will i learn"

"is in lovely stretch sweat pants t'shirt, and mix-matched toe socks  the perfect signs of a relaxing night  the joys of my may <propmale> being out of town for the weekend    r&r is all i gotta say   "
"crack a window, open a door, bust a whole in da wall, lift da roof, stomp down da floor take down da frames  oh,  tornado visit me in this hr  something is wrong when the egg yolks r missing & the egg shells are all ova da house   tension is not the word crazii & tremendously ova dramatic busted glass is the real decsription "
wat happened today? everyone like grew up ova a period of 5 hrs and i didn't even kno it til 2nite! i felt more 2day than i every had and doing it w o <propmale> kinda reminds me why i am marrying him  i haven't talked to him for 2days and the drive to hug him and release to each other makes a difference in each others lives  i miss him a lot   crying 
"i just laughed so hard i abt peed on myself! hehehe! ready 2 take some pain meds & hit da sack  i rly should say that stayin up til 5 in da morning reading a <propmale> dekker & <propfirst> peretti special, while its dark & da book plot is in alabama where u live, isn't a good idea  only had 2 hrs of sleep & want 2 read more! love the book almost as my bible-naw! its got better stories 4 my life "

"i was just put in my place and i am now over the shock  i was told i was moody, and a bunch of other things  i guess the truth is what it is and i can do lil 2 change it  going to bed and enjoy the fact that someone i loved put me in my place    some broken hearts are worth living with  it makes u a person not a monster "
"im tired, its not from working its from figuring things out & dealing with ppl  i want to cry "
oh im so happy its ova fa me! i can't believe the irritations that have happened 2day yesterday was bad 2day was worse! it had all died down by the time i left but the first 6 hours was pure   ugh! i appreciate the money race fans but my my my    ive got more stories on my wonderful belt of working @ walmart 
im very um distraught right now all i ask is for prayer  thats what i rly need
ya'll keep praying   there has got to b something instore for me
keep praying ppl    something is gotta come thru!
okay its a rough start this week but um i suppose god does have something instore cause the lashes of pain continue 2 embark on me    satan is a liar & a thief & mine is da lord's!!!
awake & still amazed   he still loves me  he is god  & he has his hand over me even when i walk astray   he is god! *tear* ya'll just dont kno wat he has done 4 me so i can just imagine wat he has done 4 you his children!
"for those of you who dont kno- i was in a car wreck sunday @ about 530 pm going 2 <propmale>'s house  i rear-ended a '92 gmc <propfirst> punctured their gas tank as i was told  i was probably going abt 50 when i hit the stationary car, my car is totalled (pics) and i came out with 2 broken fingers  im alive and well outside of that  praise god cause it could have been worse "
is this season ever goin' 2 end  4 the past 2 wks its been horrible 1 thing after another with me  enough is enough! this <propfemale> rainy season has 2 end!
"im alive and well   well that is 96% of me  i jammed my broke fingers the other day @ work and i just seem 2 keep going down hill  i am so tryuin 2 stand in this storm that has yet 2 sho signs of letting up but god be the <propfemale> regardless  it is getting rough, the waves are crashing in hard "
frustrated  angry  irritated  ugh men! is it worth it?! god didn't mean for it to be this hard  satan has got to stop it now  i rebuke him  what else am i to do 
another day and things still do not look good on the horizon   mayb the sun is rising but i just can't tell cause im not lookin @ the glass as half full but i could rly b lookin @ the glass as half empty bc i need to finish this up for a bettter drink   sounds good to me   i might need the sun to set bc i need the rest to bable to accept the blessing when it comes!
"to accept the blame is also make a better person  well i am not worthy and i a horrible person i want jesus to come in and take over  i am not trying to put my problems on you i just want you to have the whole life, that i seem to keep pickin up pieces to try and fix this like i don't trust him to fix it all  when will i learn i guess i will never kno til i do   "
"thanks vets! and thank you to those that are still fighting for the freedom of so many strangers but also fighting for your families, your lives and your country  i do appreciate it  i saw the pic previews of 2012  i think it might be corny but i tend to like things abt the end of times  it fascinates me"
finished cleaning my room   still not done with the laundry part! guess since everything is closed i'll have to do my car shoppin online   hehehehehe    no big money spender for me but boi i do want my own car this rental deal has me on edge evertime i drive it  its a nice car its just that its not mine!!!! plus its a chevy    sad 
"i am happy to hear an encouraging word from the lord thru my dad but not a famous quote from <propfirst> kerr  oh how embarrassing! sniff i'll guess that's what i get as a pk    oh, da shame and mockery!   lol it was awsome for me i will spread the news more often  christ's love shall not b hidden by me!"
i so want 2 go to sleep  i am excited abt my insurance company being so helpful   i will be in my own comfortable ride soon enough!
yes its tru  jus let me have my time thru this
im back but only bc the anchor holds!
"there r a lot of ppl that i can thank for the situation that im in, but it takes more than a mere human to take the 'big' picture & move the actors on the giant 'footstool' stage of god & we all dance accordingly  the # 1 being i thank & give my upmost praise to is god  he has been a friend protecting me, when i couldnt see, and hiding me under the shadow of his wing ~~isreal new breed: alive in south africa"
"i want 2 thank god for the supportive ppl he has put in  my life during this time  mom, dad, <propmale>, <propfirst>, <propfemale>, <propfemale>, conchetta, <propfirst>, korvell, <propmale>, church members: <propfemale> bowman, the kerrs, memaw & pop-pop norquist, <propfemale> gurley, worleys, <propfemale> tomlin, <propfirst> trott, and many more  the prayers are greatly appreciated & the love is being soaked in"
"its been a week  thx for the encouragement guys & girls alike  i made it not bc of you but bc of wat god has told you to do which makes me turn 2 god & say thank you for showing me ur mercy, grace, compassion, love, & e playful anding my faith thru it all  this is still a good thing even when on the outside looking in seems bad  count it all joy "
*sigh* it has felt like a certain someone has been laughing @ me all day  3 things came up 2 me today all related 2 them  it just seems like they r getting a kick out of this  im mad but then im also numb  mayb not too much scar tissue will build up over my wounds & i'll b able 2 b me: a little better not bitter
making it thru another day was hard but god got me thru it  i am praying for those who need it request it & other things but i rly am askingfor it myself  i kno god has something instore for me  he has 2 for a trial like this one
is hopeful in that she found another blessing & not jus an excuse  inspiration: <propfemale> adams cd day by day  i wish i had found it sooner when the trial happened weeks ago
"hoping this new \step\"" is forward not backward  trusting is hard when man distorts it but trusting in god should b easy no matter what  when you go thru things looking @ wat you have gone thru & then noticing you never trusted him in the first place lets you realize where your trust was in the first place """
god uses things 2 make u realize where u r in life  i wish that god didnt feel the need to remind me where i am  one thing after another & i thought my heart was healing 
is not saying much cause i want to focus on me  when god drags me thru a mud hole and smacks me around to the point of feeling hopeless i think he wanted my attention well he got it and i think im going to listen for a change  why did i forsake time with him b4 i will never kno  but im pretty sure i think this pain will resurface each time i even have a slight inkling of a thought of possibly doing that again
(loved) the service @ church it was just bursting with (love) & direction  i guess i can b mad but still must (love)  i also enjoyed fellowship with potential members it was (lovely & fun  im a little excited abt what is going on  but also cautious  god is the only one i can & will trust
"in the end, at the end of the day when it is all said & over with god still gets the <propfemale>  my father saved me from a huge mess and set my feet back on solid ground  what i thought was perfect deemed not perfect  what i thought was for me wasn't  my thoughts are not his thoughts  i want to give god all the <propfemale>, props and everything bc of what he has done  thank you god!!!!!"
"so sleepy! i have a feeling that god is talking 2 me in a way that i need 2 b awake but, lord couldn't you talk to me at a earlier time? of course not i wouldn't be paying any attention then like now quiet & peaceful  no 1 talking but me & him the best conversation in the world, the creator of all wants to spend time with a sinner like me & just let the rain fall (literally) "
"everytime i got to the hair dresser's i get new info from 1 of the ladies that goes there or my hair dresser  well we had church today & i enjoyed every minute of it  i was having fun, & praising god all in the middle of it  & then when it was all said & done my recent testimony proved powerful to one person & confirmed in their own trial that they are not alone  praise to the most high god & father of all creation!"
"the 1 book that has all the answers is the 1 book we tend to allow to collect dust  the 1 book that you pay 1 time for has all the self-help you could ever find  this is the 1 book that we rarely even look to  this 1 book has the mind of god, the answers of salvation, the joy of the spirit, and the ending of 'thus saith the lord'  why not rely on sola scriptura? it all ends up being soli deo <propfemale>!"
"i so enjoyed my time well spent with <propfemale> griffin, she is the most awesomess person in the world to watch tebow cry and then make fun of him and then just have a girls night out i love you <propfemale>! rtr!"
i am also happy to state that tebow has now signed a contract with the kleenex company  new commericals!     gnr     lol    oh yeah good stuff   rtr
"when u notice that god is trying 2 grow u, that is when u realize who is in control  i am a testimony 2 it all: from the rock bottom, 2 the humility, & then the big slap in the face  i have already witnessed god's work at hand from what he brought me thru  i can only give him <propfemale> for it all  14 yr old christian saved by the grace & given the mercy that i have never deserved  its amazing 2 be a friend of god  wink "
ugh! no comment so irritated!  the message was for me i guess i could have used it tonight but you know enough is enough even god has told me that  trust me i kno!
had a little fun tonight  interesting fun  didn't think it would have lasted 3 1 2 hrs either
the thing is tonight it was just me and jax! good stuff silent night holy night all is calm and whoa its not bright cause the lights are out and the sleep is in    love a quiet house and it aint even mine! oh so peaceful   sleeeeep in heavenly peeeaace! amen!
"i have a dream,---nicole c  mullens a dream to believe in"
"the movie blindside was great it was awesome to watch a movie that made you cry, laugh and get excited too  it was great!"
"wondering y i am entertainiing this fellow, its got to b something but what it is will only b shown thru time i suppose"
i have noticed something over the last few days: when i think about things too much the outcome is forced in the opposite direction and the looks of things are bleek and gray  learning to use color in a way of e playful ressing and impressioning makes me understand the thoughts on those things
"what does this day mean to you? how will you take it? where will you take it? i have my feelings but that doesn't matter, its what it is that matters  <propfemale> christmas to you all!"
"it's a lot easier to follow god but of course me, myself can't ever take the easy way i must always take the path that says \see if you can do it without him\""  when will i ever learn that <propfemale> gets the wise farther than a hasty fool"""
"as i was talking to a friend today i realized that encouragement can go a long way  through the tears, through the pain, as we hold each other & confiding in god the pain seems to lift a little  unfortunately as the humans that we are, having a pity party always seems more fun "
"when u break down its like the weight of ur head is the only thing u can hold cause if u try to hold anything else it comes to the point of unbearable stress  the yolk is easy and burden light, then y is it our heads bashing each time the problem arises  its as if i wanted it to be heavy"
once you find out who u are u are aware of whose u are and then the problem of who you are is fixable
welcoming 2011 with open arms & laughter
"taking away the past is a never ending fault  no one has conquered it, and no one will  it takes the act of god to established the future that is a result of the past  present + past = future  never doubt urself for any moment that what u are going through is something not ordained   word of the wise to myself"
it gets pretty bad when you are unhappy  its worse when no matter where u turn the unhappiness follows  it's even worse when it comes from those u love  i hate to be the one in bt ppl cause i rly don't think that it is fair to me  i know some1 needs to confide in some1 but i'd rather u pick ur friends that don't have to worry about them chosing whose side to b on  i will not bite the hand that feeds me 
"the first time i actually enjoyed working at walmart  i was able to watch the 1st half of the game and then \speed\"" home to watch the 2nd half  awesome roll tide  i guess everything in texas aint big!"""

"i am at home nicely warm bt the fire and my blankets  the warmth of the heart is very misunderstood  it is very deceitful, above all things "
"god has kept me i survived bc he has a plan 4 me all bad relationships, addictions, consequences, repossessions, death of loves ones, back stabbin 4m friends, neg thoughts, & lack of support i made it bc im blessed! i release & let go of past hurts, misunderstandins, & grudges bc im abundantly blessed! i recognize them as illusions, & sent from da enemy 2 kill my spirit, steal my joy & destroy my faith;"
"something happened to today that may make some wonder what happened and others just nosey  too bad u couldn't have felt it, but since you are still wondering keep doing that and maybe you will understand its not what u saw, or heard, its what i felt "
"well the new year has started  i have taken the steps to getting back to what i was doing b4 when the joy of the lord was all i needed  the holy spirit made the love just shine and unless you know what that feeling is, and the love that you have yet to e playful erience will never show  dont judge me bc u don't understand y i do the things i do"
"(*sick* the dizzy spells won't leave ) despite that, its been 2 months of the absolute 'coming out party'  sry to those that couldn't make it, but the important ppl are here & bump the rest of ya'll! i love god, get over it or get bounced out of my party! this actor has a part to play & party poopers aint allowed! so get right or get lefted cause the rest of us got some serious celebration to do!"
"but if it became true, kalman would eliminate her "
cleaning    wat a mean cuss word! along with the other letters of the alphabet with words that start with a  b   c   d   e   f   g   h  i  j  k  lol   thought i was going to keep it going naw i gotta do the 'c' word b4 the 'w' word (work) yeah this is an all day thing u guys better get ready for it! if being a child causes me joy and peace guess what my plans are today!
"well da 'c' word is finally complete  (cleaning) bt da dreaded 'w' word which was for only 4 hours! (work) i am so glad that god has given me the gifts that i have  u will never know the joy that i have bc the gift is personal, but u can have the type of joy that i have bc god has something personal for u  2  god didn't put me here 2 fail, but 2 excel  complete, with the <propfemale> place abundantly in his name!"
mayb i shouldn't have taken that leap   
i did the macarena witha pickle riding a motorcycle bc big bird said to and he is my leader 
"amazing! to be loved, not by men but by god, so sincerly that it makes you want to cry, the joys, of the rock, the love, the blood, the christ, him alone!"
"well in a nutshell the day ended in what i thought was an embarrassed moment    until my firends asked me who i was and when was she coming back   then i realized, she is lost and i have to go find her    i found her she is with god in icu  (intensive christs unit) she'll b back after her training   "
"oh god is     words cannot e playful ress  u can never know unless u know, bc it takes a personal bond to know, that to know is past the realm of ur knowledge: god"
oh this un-gracious headache! the world seems lighter when the strongest arms are holding the 'biggest' cares  its different trials when you look at the huge solution  how much bigger do u think god is gonna get? he has been the same size the whole time  u just keep piling the dirt on & making it out to be 'bigger' than the strongest 
"during this week please change your profile picture to someone famous (actor, musician, athlete) you have been told you look like    lets keep the fun going    post this to your profile and message your friends with it!"
"up this early?! seriously!? ugh man, i could have used that last hr of sleep! mayb not since god did wake me up  when i looked at the clock i thought i was in heaven    cause i knew god wasn't playing no jokes this early in the morning! 1 ) it aint funi & 2 ) its just wrong! (but \my thought are not your thoughts or my ways your ways\"")"""
"frustration   any evil tool to use, but gets me everytime  its like a cascading affect on everything in life  first you lose focus, second you stray, and thirdly everything falls apart  the best motivation in it all is stop when you lose focus, i can barely walk in a straight line when i'm not wearing glasses, or contacts!"
"so if u have noticed, satan is dumb! know ur enemy! everything that he uses is everything that can be taken & used 4 jesus  he is a copy cat! nothing that he has as ammo is something he created on his own  its all on what we give him to use! ugh! i wished i had noticed this earlier in the battle!"
on the floor
4 those who are praying for; <propfirst> <propfirst> said that she would b out of the hospital on tuesday 
"so i finally realized that what i realized wasnt tru, but i didnt want 2 realize the truth bc im human w  a horrible realiization memory  every1 has at least 1 real skeleton in their closet; not the fact that its there but, the person who wants 2 get rid of it, or keep it there, or dust it off 2 make 'em feel better abt it  im not perfect, my flaws r endless so im not here 2 judge  just 2 guide w  a humble spirit"
so when u are sick and tired of where u are at it's time to move on 
noticed the big picture yet?! 2 many times that one problem misses out on what it really means in the big picture  repeat : big picture & mayb you will see the big picture  god is bigger than our problems  the big picture is bigger than our world  big things come to those who wait  big big big picture 
"pray  w o ceasing, pray bc we need it, pray bc its a commandment, pray when things are good, pray when things are ugly, pray just bc u like to talk and god is the only one who will listen "
"i hate walmart! i rly do! im not sugar coating it or being \nice\""  i work around ppl dat r ungrateful  management wants me 2 return 2 da slave days & bust my tail 4 no money! this is ridiculous! just bc i cant create a miracle in less than 3 hrs u want 2 tell me i need 2 work faster its da day b4 vday next time ill run da customers over! & take over da village! ugh i can't wait 17 more wks and im gone!!!!!"""

since my body knows it doesn't have 2 go 2 work later on today maybe i was thinking it would shut it down   not but listening 2 the rain is most enjoyable  almost as much as sittin on the beach watchin the waves & enjoying the sounds of them  nature god's gift 2 us wretched ppl who havent learned 2 appreciate that gift that was given so long ago along with the rest of them
its sad when the visiting pastor is so in-tuned with god that he can pick out the laundry  in the church  i mayb the only one who noticed but he is a man of god  i mean just throwing dirity clothes everywhere & then turn and looked at us like duh!!!!  lol  just incase u can't read in b t the lines i am loving the revial at our church this week!
dr  jekylls first name is henry    henry!
so god is great right! that was a statement not a question 
feeling cramped  lingering in the freedom of the holy spirit    that is the only freedom that i can freely e playful ress without question
have you every felt like you were invisible? like some people diliberately ignore you? or maybe that when it occurs to you that its not all about you  notice its all about god  he is ignored more than any of us  how would you feel if you were around for thousands of yrs & completely ignored  our life is nothing but a vapor  he is eternal
who has washed their vehicle at 11pm? i have! not by choice  see the lord knows i needed to wash my car   well i guess god said tonight was my special night  i want to thank the idiot who splattered some carmelized crap on my car & tires so that my brakes would start scrubbing  which caused me to have to wash my car when i got home at 11pm!
hypothermia is not good at all
"i wouldn't call myself crazy, just mentally hilarious"
"i love full moons! i love  the god who created it all  if it wasn't for full moons that i love freakish things wouldn't happen: kids playing hide & go seek, and cheerleading skits at walmart, my room being clean oh a floor!, & the great feeling you have when you are doing something you enjoy: laughing! if god has a sense of humor why shouldn't we?"
is sick  where's a sexy male nurse when you need one?
"sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't, whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo, almond joy's got nuts, but mounds don't ~almond joy  mound comercial remix  when i feel like a nut for real its beyond me cause i kno i am not the one who is keeping me from going nuts on ppl  it's a prayer i read one time  god keep me from showing ppl how i rly feel abt them  so i have learned to laugh & keep my distance"
"realizes   u never grow up   u just learn how 2 behave in public   but then when u r with those individuals you call friends its like all source of that education is thrown out the window to the sorry sap that is standing next 2 u wishing u would grow up  lighten up ppl its life, no1 gets out alive anyway  trust me there is only 1 being who did & let me tell u he is amazing! jesus did it just 4 me!"
"the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese  its more like you learn for someone else's mistakes, in a bad way  will it take someone diying to make you realize that it would be easier to get the cheese if you just had common sense to work for it yourself? take the advice from '<propmale> and <propfirst>' if you don't believe me!"
"so me and my baby sister, which name is <propfemale>, <propmale> out tonight and we had so much fun  we saw several celebrities: snoop dogg, and the cast from the nightmare before christmas  then we discussed lil wanye's appearrance in our lives, and then we also just had fun shooting the breeze with each other  it was a load of fun  good quality fun sisterly love all the way love you ni-ni!"
i have learned that a woman's pride is 100x's worse than any man's ego  just pay attention to a black woman who is mad & has been 'done wrong'  im so serious you think that pride comes before a fall on that one geez   it gets worse after they fall! its like u would we would learn!
"well the difference bt here & now is what happened yesterday  however, it also determines how you look at tomorrow  yes, live like today is your last day & love like you will never get the <propmale> to again, but remember there is nothing like the present the gift  god didn't put you here to fail, but to excel"
"im not <propfemale>, so if u pinch me bc i purposely don't wear green im going to punch you bc i purposely don't like being pinched and im not <propfemale>! im black with a mixture i know but don't pinch me i am givin u a fair warning! disclosure: it is an invasion of personal spacethat you were not allowed to touch & i will take my rights as an individual in the country & use self defense towards anyone who violates that right!"
"pray: like you never have, like you should always, like its your last breath, like time is up, like the essence will end, like god the father desires it, like the passion of a football game, like the end is near, like the time is now, and like you love so dear    pray"
wow it has been a few days but it is all good the trip to mobile with <propfemale> went off very well very excited abt going down there to live starting fresh on my own  so keep the prayers coming i do greatly appreciate it also @ <propfirst> tims: good seeing you down there and can't wait to share some good stories !
"so excited about tomorrow!!! better yet, who wouldn't be excited about tomorrow  if tomorrow never happened     well then it did & i, me, this person typing this is thankful! its just as exciting as christmas if not more  it is true though you can't have easter without christmas, & christmas would be pointless without easter  he is alive!"
happy resurection day! i am so excited about this great day! i don't even wanna think if this day didn't happen  satan has no power over today or any day for that matter but i just wanted to concure to him that he was defeated on this day  i've got victory not because ofmy works but because of christ  take that satan and cry because christ is lord of lords and <propmale> of <propmale>s!
"so if the world ends today, or maybe tomorrow in australia's realm, what would you do? we all have problems but what would you do? i have problems but what would you do? she has problems but what woudl you do? he has problems but what you do? its gettting kinda catchy huh? almost like wwjd? ummmmmm   "
taking a stand because no one else seems to think that they should  i love doing the opposite of what ppl do  it makes you an individual and it makes you understand that god didn't call us to be like everyone else  look at yourself! there is only one person to resemble and that is jesus the christ!
"so there is this thing where god is big! like super big! like the kind of big that when words get in the way and a feeling of sorts that can only be felt steps in and makes the world go away! its that big that even the world has to get out of the way?! yeah he is that big  i can't even justify with that phrase really, but he is big i can most definately tell you that "
well the old beast has died  it lived to be a riping 5 years old before a virial infection took it over and completely destroyed it  but it didn't take long to get over it cause there is a new high roller in town and it involves a lot less work welcome home hp g71! welcome home!

"is in that mode of killing, its best if you are an able bodied being that has any sense of danger be greatly advised to steer clear  after you have seen what i have seen today and dealt with what i have dealt with amongst other people who have had the same e playful erience and willing to kill all the same victims you would wholeheartedly agree    you have been warned!"

"ok guys and gals i don't ask for help much or prayer often but i request help now  i am asking you (those that are born again believers whom believe in the power of prayer) to plz throw me on your altar & pray earnestly for me  i am stuck b t a rock 7 a serious hard place  i believe in the power of prayer plz pray for me the situation to be specific is school, job transfer & favortism in the finacial area also  thx!"

"well i still have a job! i don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing  either way, i still have that j-o-b  good news for those that are praying for me in my situation with school, work transfer, and financial stufs  i did get a call back from a store that is looking out for me in a ft position i mean seriously are working with me! oh how god works even when my faith waivers"

enjoyed the time with the church ladies tonight! there is something abt the big picture in it all  praying for someone & the thought of prayer does bring a closeness & a connection w  beings w n the body of christ  so many different ladies with so many different lives but yet all connect   interesting its almost like saying there is an ultimate being ruling us on this big stage called life   ummmm
less than an hr left @ da place every1 shops  i know this may sound stupid but i abt jumped 4 joy when i saw 6 o'clock  praise da lord!  its those little things when ur having a bad day dat makes it a little more bearable  oh so sweet!
2 b completely honest w  myself & every1 that knows me pretty well; i was so mad that i could pull a brick out of the side of a wall & crush a ton of ice with my butt! no lie  i seriously could have happened either that or i get a temporary job with the double agents 
seriously thinking abt going into law school later     its kinda interesting to argue for a living and make a good amt going it properly   ummm   food for thought
"individual goals: working out; purchasing a camera, book, movies, & a giant pillow! yeah that pillow is gonna rock!   i just realized that the thinks i enjoy most are slowly slipping from my life, drawing, photography, reading christian fiction, watching action, comedy, and drama movies    esp working out! man to be that strong looking woman w  the confidence i had then (tisk tisk) i let it all go  prayer plz!"
"what's on my mind?! what's on my mind?! i'll tell u what's on my mind! as soon as i figure it out, i'll tell you!"
"really wants to go swimming, but doesn't have a pool  sad  sad sad feeling  really wants to go to the beach but has no gas to get there    sad  double sad feeling  really hates this sad feeling    triple some kinda feeling!"
i am so grateful that i am not in a clique!
happier than happy to not be considered one of those people that leave people out  joyful in that people can come to me and talk to me because i don't come across as judgemental  over joyed because god chose me to stand out of that clique!
this disobedience is costing me
watching teen titans!
<propmale> and kyrie's wedding was beautiful i do wish the best for them  my favorite part of the wedding was the ceremony  so many priceless moments  even <propfemale> was included in it which just abt made me cry 
needs a better pain killer   anyone have a gun i can borrow?
"enjoyed the evening w  her awesome babe! it was worth the night on the town, random things we do but we enjoyed every minute of it, cant lie i think i rly like this guy   lol"
"i hate it when i'm trying to b nice to someone & include them n my life but, they continue to push me away  better yet, they give me reason to be pushed away  no more ms nice woman! i can tell u that  they only wanna talk when they wanna talk, do when they wanna do it  i have ppl that i see everyday that treat me w  more respect than they do   ugh so lame ppl can b so lame!"

enjoyed the night with the one and only <propfirst> greene! it was a great night i mean we had this unplanned date night that led to and amazing end  regardless of what people think & how they picture our lives  we have a bond that can't be compared with others  he said it best himself tonight !
"took those happy pills now about to play til they knock me out  if anything said, after this post, comes across amiss, or off-color plz disregard! it is the medicine talking and not me in my right state of mind  i repeat i am not responsible for anything said after this post you have been warned!"
so this is the first time i watched the twilight movie tonight w  <propfirst> greene  interesting enough he wanted to go see it  it wasn't a bad film less romance & more fighting scenes would have sufficed 
"some people are not worth my time  not stupidity, or the fact that i care for them any less, just they are not worth my time  energies for lack of a better term"
ready for the change guess it is time for that leap of faith that <propmale> <propfirst> is always telling me to take
searching again today 
"i want to publicly thank <propfemale> <propfirst>, <propfirst> greene, and <propfemale> fisher for supporting my dreams  thanks a lot you don't know how much this means to me that i do have those that have faith in god to tell me the right thing to do and not waiver from it  i love these people but i know that god put these people in my life for a reason  that reason is evident everyday  gotta love those that put you back on track "
what is the definition of work?
feels better fpr the most part better today than yesterday  always a good sign   
"is feeling weird, she is about to find solitude in cutting grass this evening  a dreaded feeling acrosses her face as the photos of green clippery wisk under and vanish, blade by blade the metal grass flows toward its rewared demise to once again grow   "

"the greatest man in the world talked to me today, even spent a large amount of the day w  me  we had so much fun, talking about old times, even discussing the future  i ? him, he ?s me  never have i had such a great connection w  such a wonderful man  he always knows, even when i don't say a single word "
"how about today went real well  i spent a lot of time at his house and we spent a lot of time together  he hugged me  i feel like a <propfemale> when we are together  i know he is my <propmale>  today was very special for me, he wiped tears from my face, kissed me on my forhead and told me he loved me  it made me cry even more  he smiled, & he grasped my hand  he never let go"
"so today was a trying day for me, but he understood  he still listened, held my hand, called me & even whispered little things in my ear  he saw my frustration, but pulled me to the side hugged me so tight that i know he never let go  kissed my hand & told me i was everything to him "
some family is so sorry  your mother should b assisted by you not your child  the children of their parents should take care of their parents not the grandchildren taking care of their grandparents  i should be taking care of my parents since they are still alive to take care of their parents
so i had very rough the last few days but guess who was beside me  that wonderful man! i cried so much yesterday and he still sat next to me and held me like it was the first time he had seen me cry  to the very moment when i was ready to give it all away  he told me not to worry about it and how i didn't have to ask him he loves me anyway  what a great and awesome man 
"the love of my life showed respect, honesty, & compassion  i was able to take that same gift & return it  i was mad, sad, & furious but he held me so tight  with a glimpse in his eyes, a kiss on the forehead, a smile to melt all worries away he captured my heart  in the stillness of the moment, we were the only ones there just bathing in the love b t 2 "
"it is something about talking to the one you love that makes all the difference in the world  even when all seems lost and things are up in the air, the love of my life still stands  strength like that 'newness' never wears off  that 'closeness' that can't be pulled apart  that 'awesomeness' that someone thinks about you all the time even when you are not thinking about them"
good job tigers! but now its time for bama to roll back into play  & i might say so my self for last week and this week: rooooolllll tide!

"it's not ironic that he found me, saw my value, & respected me  the  love  he gives to me no one can take away, not even the next man, there isn't any competition! i'm over joyed he sees me as his bride, the  love  of his life, the calm of my storms  peace, ?, & my ever living happiness  there isn't any man's ? is comparable to his "
"happy in his eyes i am everything  he understands my faults, he  love s me regardless  i cant seem to get over it  its a  love  that i <propfemale> & never want to go away  you see men will leave, make things hard, for you even, hurt you but the one that  love s me treats me like a <propfemale>  his precious <propfemale> "
