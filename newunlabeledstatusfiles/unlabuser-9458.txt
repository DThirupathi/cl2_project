"i am getting promoted to a trainer at my second job soon and i am up for another evalution at subway, which means more money   woot! i know kevi is starting up his summer classes in the beginning of june and he is trying to switch jobs to <propmale> millers or something that pays better than palladium so he can work less and focus more on school "
"kevi spent his day off spending time with his friends from work and we went out for dinner at pho's once i got home with them   i don't like opening at 5 in the morning, so sleepy   i am glad <propfirst> has people whom he can practice, train and work-out with since they share a common schedule   today they went swimming, how lucky!"

"well, what a strange week this will be   <propfirst> is heading up to <propfirst> for monday and tuesday and me, i'll be in <propfirst> for the weekend selling stuff, meeting the top sellers in the country   makes me nervous that my boss already has that much faith in me    surprise   best thing is though, i don't have to pay for my plane ticket, food and hotel!  and then a-con is the following weekend, so i'll be back up to <propfirst>!! lolz!"
it seems my trip to <propfirst> has been cancel due to my boss   >_>  pretty sure they fired her from the smart circle   so i am at lost on what is going on   but the owner of smart circle is helping me somewhat   it actually is okay b c i just got sick last night!  lol so i wouldn't have been able to work in the first place this weekend anyway
