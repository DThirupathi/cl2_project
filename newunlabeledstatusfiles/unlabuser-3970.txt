happy new year all! time for resolutions          mine is to not make resolutions  they never end well   smile 
"at math item writing in <propfemale> for the week, woke up with pink eye and my phone got ran over in parking lot last night! ugh  i need summer to start!"
"i hate being away from my family! i need to snuggle livi, hug <propfemale>, wrestle <propmale>, and kiss my wonderful husband! sigh              only 23 more hours til i am home "
"livi did a scary thing on saturday! two hours before her first birthday party she through a fit and as she sat on the floor crying because she couldn't chew on plastic (mean mom!) she turned blue, stopped breathing, and her eyes rolled back in her head  s"
"was a little dazed  i never knew that this is very common  i learned babies can have a fit and hold their breath until they pass out, but then wake back up and have no side effects  i think i lost four years off my life with this e playful erience  i am definite"
peaceful night at home with my husband and livi  we just did wii fit  started the 30-day challenge  it was fun and sweaty!
"exhausted      livi has been sick, so no rest for the weary! bed at 7 sounds good "
"it sucks    i get on here and read about all the fun people are having over the summer and i am jealous! work all week and classes all weekend  no helicopter rides, family trips, scrapbooks!  sad "
so relieved! the coworker we were worried about turned out to be just fine! wrong person in paper and wrong information given by the funeral home  one day of mourning for a stranger makes you fully appreciate the people in your life that you love and resp
"ahhh a great day! a 5 mile walk with livi and <propfemale>, found a new <propfemale> for our family  he is pitiful      missing his lower lip and was terribly dirty and hungry    but we gave him a bath    yes, a cat bath! and now he is shiny, happy, full, and quite handsome! even without all his lip  then had a great dinner with the in-laws and great grandma! now movie time and snuggles from the baby an husband      ahhhhh    "
the only vacation we had this summer due to summer school was our 40 hour trip to great wolf lodge (the indoor water park      aka germ heaven)  imagine 300 hundred strangers bathing together! yuck  the facilitities were remarkably clean considering and the kids had a blast  <propfirst> and i spent 40 hours chasing livi around on wet concrete! exhaustion     (i just needed to complain a bit!)
feeling sad that there are so many followers in the world      not enough people willing to take risks to make a difference!
have a mess to clean up     took kids school clothes shopping in seattle this weekend      have tons to unpack and laundry to do  i spent hours chasing livi all over the place  she is fast! thinking i should be super in shape with the baby aerobics! hah! life is cruel       but funny    very very funny     smile 
"wow! great first day of school! i have a wonderful paws class     already love them  things went smoothly, new vice principal seems very nice     "
"home now! open house was a great success! lots of happy students, parents, and teachers             go team!  smile "

livi got tubes in her ears today! hopefully this will mean an end to the 3-month-long ear infection  sleep be with us              
"had to work today (actually drive to t-town)! if i survive my principal intership, i think i should get a trip to hawaii! **hint, hint**"
"today was a great day! our m e l t  (math educational leadership team) met and we had a high output, emotionally satisifying, intellectually stimulating professional development session! my favorite  i love this job   smile  thank you <propfemale>, <propfirst>, and <propfemale> for all your dedication to our students and your professional, can-do winning attitudes! i am proud to be part of melt  <propfemale> parrish-frederiksen"
