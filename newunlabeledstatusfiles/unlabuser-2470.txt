"just finished eating pork chops with rice and gravy     can't make it like my mom but it was still good  <propmale> said it was delicious but then again, he is e playful ected to say that or else his spontaneous respirations would immediately cease!"

had a blast with my cute little patient last night!  we played and danced and sang! to see her go from being on a ventilator and every drip you can imagine to what she is now     it's like watching a butterfly emerge from a cocoon   *sigh*  i love my job!!!
"was on-call for <propfirst> last night and got called in for the whole shift!! thanks bitch, haha! on-call tonight for myself   i pray that the luck of the <propfemale> is on my side and i can stay home with my kiddos and my fireman but i don't think the er gods like me very much     "
"while driving home from taking my kids to school, a dipshit ran me off the freeway   i overcorrected, ran into another <propfirst> & almost spun out   luckily, my amazing \ricky-bobby\"" skills emerged & i fishtailed a few feet before maintaining control of my car   <propmale> just put new tires on it yesterday  i woulda died had he not done so because my old tires were warped balding   he is truly my knight in shining fireboots!"""
sitting at home on-call       dreading the moment that phone rings     i pray the e r  gods will have mercy on me   day shift called me in around 5 but then cancelled me around 5:45 so i was able to dodge the bullet once already      only 6 more hours to go and i am free!!!!
i am finally able to have some 'me' time!!!
"my cat is pregnant  she will soon be sent to live at dr  schwirtlich's ranch   if anybody wants free kittens, let me know   <propmale> claims to be allergic to the feline population so they can't stay here   yes miss elektra     i know i made a mistake but she was a misguided teen who slept with all the neighborhood boys   she snuck out on me before i could get her to the vet "
"my <propfemale> had 6 kittens   if nobody wants them, i am going to have to give them all to elektra so she can have them featured in \american curves   <propfemale> edition\""  hahaha!!  and then elektra will kick my butt for being such a smart-ass but she loves her bff and she will forgive me!"""
"<propfemale> has the worst fever!  the lowest i've gotten it is 100 4 from 103 8 despite all the tylenol motrin she's had for the past 2 days  through it all, she still has her spunk & charm  she demands i call <propmale> home from the station because he knows how to fix her better!  what am i chopped liver!  i barely slept for 2 days to ensure she's ok & she doesn't even want me!  pinche cabrona!   smile "
loving my boo and so happy he is healthy and vibrant as he celebrates his birthday today   i look forward to another 90 more   i couldn't have asked the lord for a better puto to spend the rest of my life with!   smile 
i have the most beautiful sister in the world!!
i don't understand why total strangers feel the need to converse with me while standing in line at the grocery store   i try to be polite but my facial e playful ressions just give me away     
"i had to give the \you're not supposed to give the dog a piggy-back ride\"" talk to <propfemale> today    i can't get that awful blood-curdling yelp out of my head  what to do    what to do! this daughter of mine is definitely a handful and i can't give her away because every time i try they just bring her right back! i guess i will keep her afterall   wink """
i miss my boo   i hope he is safe tonight    gotta be at work in a few hours and i find it hard to rest whenever he is saving lives and not cuddling with me     the void is horrible!
"gonna take the kids to seaworld tomorrow!!!  \please god     let them behave\""     """
"on our way to the land of the whales    wait, that's corpus!!  i meant seaworld!!  thanks <propfirst> for staying at our house so ashes doesn't freak while we're gone!  just stay out of our closet!  you might find pictures of you brother in a way you haven't seen since childhood!!  haha!!  except this time, things are bigger!!!   smile "
"my 3 little precious babies are in alaska for 2 weeks and i miss them so much my heart aches!!  they drove me nuts when they were home but i would give anything to have them here now   i miss all the little notes <propfemale> would scribble for me, the boys fighting over the playstation, the running in the hallway, their sticky kisses, drinks spilled on the table   *sigh*  this is awful!!!  just dreadful! :,-("
"had to stay home from work today   got bilateral flank pain, low grade temp, bladder spasms, feel like i have to pee but nothing happens when i try   i have never had a uti before so this must be it!  i may stop by work tonight and see what it's like to have to wait for 8 hours in the lobby   i'm gonna pace around and give the triage nurse dirty looks every time i pass by the desk!!!  hahahaha!!!!!"
"last night i had a sweet, precious lady who endured a mild stroke  i got to be the one who had the privilege of taking care of her   she was so thankful & emotional   it is patients like her who remind me how awesome my job is & how important my role can be in a strangers life   i finally feel like i made a difference & i'll never forget the warmth i felt as we cried together & prayed for a nice recovery "
"i thought i was getting better!  yesterday, i went to work feeling fine     highly medicated but felt better   today, i am crampy, n v, and hot flashes   i have taken 4 showers and still feel like shit!  i hate feeling like this when i have so many things i should be doing    like being at work!!!  i feel guilty for being home but i know i would be useless if i was there "
going nighty-night and cuddle with my sweety-pie!!  i love feeling his big lumpy muscular arms wrapped around me as i doze off into dreamyland     ahhhhh     this is the life!!!  only thing missing are the beautiful angels who we treasure with all of our hearts to come jump into bed with us and bring us back to reality   smile 
"so ready to go back to sleep but it is so difficult when my lil puto isn't home   so i am going to take a nice steamy shower, put some lotion on, floss and brush my chompers, comb my hair, put on some lip gloss, and then go to bed and drift off to dreamy-land and catch some zzzzzzz's        "
looking forward to going back to work tomorrow!  i have been fustrated all this week at home feeling sick and lousy!  this wedding planning is frustrating me!  i miss my kids!!  my stress level is beyond all comprehension     i am such a procrastinator and i can't get my shit together!  ugh!!!
