i'm scared and i hate when people don't answer their phones  it makes me sad 
i wish i could know what's going on  it's scaring me 
"while you scream at your woman, there's a man\wishing he could talk softly to her ear    while you humiliate,offend\and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how\wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he\could make love to her  while you make your women cry there's a man\stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence"

"1 every 10 people born are gay  that means 1 of every 10 people are instantly put down, given bad labels, left alone, put in a minority and so much more, all for something they didn't ask for  gay teens are committing suicide as a way of escaping  if you want to tell them life will get better and you respect them, copy and paste this  most of you wont, but let's see the 5% of you who will  stand up against bullying!"
