girls > boys
people have a serious problem of being faithful to each other anymore
as long as you got me you won't need nobody  smile 
"life kicks you around sometimes  it scares you and beats you up  but there is one day when you realize  youâ€™re not just a survivor  youâ€™re a fighter \youâ€™re tougher than anything life throws your way "
"this day sucks so much ass, it's unbelievable "
