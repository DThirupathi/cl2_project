"it has become obvious to me that people who have no business reading my posts are, and are reporting them to the guardian ad litem becuase of supposed slander   who here has heard me slander them?  that's what i thought "
"due to this it is obvious that i am going to have to keep posting just how i feel just to prove to them that they do not have control over my life and my writings   the writings i post here have nothing to do with what type of parent i am, and they must be desperate to resort to this petty shit "
"so, in continuance, i am asking all of my friends that know <propfirst> or his parents to please post exactly what they feel about them   here goes: <propfirst> is a child molester pervert wife beater that is so stupid he almost ran his daughter over   his parents are so controlling they probably time whem <propfemale> goes to the bathroom to make sure that she goes when they want her to go "
"and lets talk about how nosy they are   they have no business reading my facebook <propfemale>, my security is set to its highest level, and the only way they can be reading ths is if they are going through one of my friends   i feel that they had no right to take my daughter from me and have no intention of coming to any agreement on giving her back no matter what they say "
"they have wanted <propfemale> since the day i had <propfirst> arrested, and now they have the control over her life that they didn't have over me   don't you think it's strange that <propfirst> couldn't even go grocery shopping without calling his mother to verify the prices he was paying were good enough?  i was his wife i was right there "
"as you can tell they have made me beyond angry, and  i hope that they do read this, because maybe they will see how they are hurting my dausghter by keeping her away from her mother   thats where she belongs   i have done everything that they have asked of me and yet they just keep adding to the list instead of transitioning her home "
"i may not be a perfect parent, but they certainly are not perfect parents either   <propfirst> used to complain all of the time about how his father beaat him and the psychologist told his mother that <propfirst> would be better off if his father was out of his life   yet, they have <propfemale> "
"they may call this slander but this is nothing compared to what they spread about my parents and family   and they do not even know how my family has changed   they think because my family grew up with less mmoney than they did that we are not good enough   well, that is not true   we are better "
"we know how to tell the real depth of a person   we love our family, not control them   i will get my daughter back i promise you that   there are things i have in the works that are going to change everything "
"please people, post your comments about this, and how you feel i have dealt with all of thier under-handed bullshit without cracking yet   i think that i am dealing pretty well with the whole situation   i disagree that my postings attest to my instability, for they are simply the truth put out there for the workld to see   how do they like that?"
"please everyone, read all of these posts, starting at the bottom and post your comments   i want to know what everyone has to say   the evil grandfather wrote to the guardian ad litem about my facebook postings again, so i thought i would give them something to write about "
"no one has responded yet to my cry of outrage?  someone please tell me right on or something like that   i mean, i know its going to piss them off, but if i breathe wrong it pisses them off "
"happy birthday stef, i won't be on a computer til next week after right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
i am so happy   i have my baby until tuesday   i am so happy   so happy   so happy   did i mention how happy i am?
love my girl even though she is tired and cranky 
some situations are just out of our hands and when something happens that you think you would like you think again about the negative consequences for others   oh life what a mystery 
today we learned that mama was right when she said dont jump on the bed 
<propfemale> goes home today   i am not happy about that   we had a really great time    on another note i have  not gotten any messages from anyone in a long time   does no one want to talk to me?
the day is almost over and <propfemale> is going home soon   right now we are drawing with chalk on my front walkway   i am going to miss her so much   it was so great to have her all of this time 
the bad part is is that tomorrow i have to in back to the real world and that includes school and a test   so tonight i have to keep myself together enough to study   does anybody have any tips on how to stop the pain and go on with my normal life?
<propfemale> just left five minutes ago   no tears yet   have not gone into the house yet though   anyone whe sees this in the next half hour before i go veg out in front of the tv is welcome to call or text of to keep my mind off of things   thanks in advance 
on second thought call anytime   or text   i like to text 
having trouble sleeping   of course this is the first night without <propfemale> in four nights   and of course i have to be up in less than four hours and have school until nine thirty pm   figures 
oy vey   the drama of life seems to grow every day   what will happen to me next?
strange ways but things work out 
have my new student orientation today at the university!  good and bad   glad to be starting but a group full of college kids?  thank god for friends that wont make you go through that alone!
<propfemale>
pain sucks   broke a tooth   ouch as hell 
stressed the f out   the last three weeks of my associates degree are a killer   and no vacations for of to get away from it all 
i got my social security disability granted and my handicapped parking permit in the same day   coincidence? i think not   fate 
a friend is saying good bye after i said f you after being lied to twice   them i got threatened to never call or contact him again   oh the things his wife would want to know about him   
long day   some frustrations but mostly good day   got my baby way early even though she was sick   that was not too good but tylenol works wonders for little ones   hope she feels better tomorrow for the park 
its freaking hot out here 
is wondering why people do or say they will do things for you and say they are ok with them and then turn around and tell you they were not ok with it in a public venue such as facebook   he you thought it was wrong then tell of not the rest of the world   give of a <propmale> to work things out before it is out in front of all of you to see 
for example i have this friend that i really case about and he and i used to be close   circumstances and life choices have changed that   but if he said he was going to be somewhere he was always there   now it is like pulling teeth to get him to go through with one little thing he says her going to do   frustrating 
is really annoyed at all of the love obnoxious motorcycles driving by 
finally got to sleep with my cpap machine on an i feel pretty good   may be up early but do not feel like i have been hit by a train 
tomorrow starts a boatload of homework for the next three weeks   them a whole summer off   who is coming to my graduation june third call me

i only have three days of classes and one final to attend before i graduate!  look out eastern i an coming to get my bachelors 
still no messages from anyone   noone has anything to say to me?  just tell of how your life is going or about your kids or jobs or any or girl friends   its not like i see any of you on a daily basis   once i am done with school next week i am going to start writing long messages to everyone   you have been warned 
not one friend except <propfemale> has sent me a message in a long time   start writing people   i understand you have lives but two minutes to tell of you are doing well you have your job your dog pees in your slippers etc
