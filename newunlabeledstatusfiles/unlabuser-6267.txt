"all of this is changing, none of this seems real, i just keep on waiting, to see if i can feel, something like an angel watching over me, maybe that's exactly what's in front of me, 'cause i'm better off now, since you came around, you've gone and shown me, everything i needed just to see that i am, better off now, since you came around, all i had to do is see what i could be, so i could know i'm, better off now"
