let's see how creative my facebook friends are    leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name    it can only be 1 word    then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you    don't just post a word & not copy 'cause that's no fun 
happiness is something that comes into our lives through doors we don't even remember leaving open 
\it's so pathetic you care so much, about what other people think \35cef6ca090e0700f26cf56b4921aa33,"be yourself be werid be awsome be stupid be funny make mistakes be scared grow up don't get to caught in the past look forward to the future find your purpose in life  to be blunt, don't go out&get fucked up out of your mind on whatever the fuck all you do  don't do shit thats going to mess up your chances in life  but then again, why do i give a shit, be my guest&fuck up your life just dont drag me into it smile "
had an awesome weekend at nicoles dads house  now back to school in the a m 
i want to feel like&know im gonna have a steady future  but as of now i know nothing 
heros are made when you make a choice 
tell me i'm selfish  tell me i'm a bitch  tell me i'm a loser  tell me i'm a lier  tell me your better then me  tell me i'm not going anywhere in life  talk to me in 2 1 2 years&see where i am  watch how much better off i am than you  then try to tell me your better than me& that i'm not gonna go anywhere 
"'if it happens it happens and i'll be the same\can't hold back on the choices i made that day\i've come to accept\the things that i see\i've read every word, every line, everything\just say what you will\just tell me i'm scared'"
"'that's when she said i don't hate you boy\i just want to save you while there's still something left to save\that's when i told her i love you girl\but i'm not the answer to the questions that you still have'"
"'i lie here shaking on this bed, under the weight of my regrets \i hope that i will never let you down \i know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound \look around and you'll see that at times it feels like no one really cares '"
i realised i'm kinda like a really hateful person at times  but the hate i have towards most of humanity i don't share with many people 
people who act like someone their not bug the shit outta me 
anybody in track: are we supposed to wear the sweatshirt and the sweatpants tommarow? or can we just wear the sweatshirt?
i realised that i dont hate them  i hate what they did to me  i hate how i was treated  i hate what they called me and what they tried to say i did 
\i stare at our picture\,35cef6ca090e0700f26cf56b4921aa33,take me back to how it use to be  that's all i ask 
i know i always say i don't care what people say about me or think about me  but thats a lie  i do care&i hate when people feel like they have any right to judge me  i hate being stereotyped as something im not  someone i never was&never will be  im real  im not living a lie anymore  im being true to myself and im not gonna let anyone stop me from making myself happy and my life worth living 
\it kills me not to know this but i've all but just forgotten\,35cef6ca090e0700f26cf56b4921aa33,dear facebook: why do you close my chat boxs after i sign out? i'd like them to stay open please -__-
