"wow! last nite was crazy fun! im freaking hungover, i can still taste vodka in my mouth! now im stuck at my apartment with no phone and no vehicle   kinda curious to see how im gonna get to the westside to pick those items up!"
i really hope someone comes to pick me up so i can get my vehicle and phone! i hate being stranded!

gonna clean the house and wach some football!!
"some decsions in life need to be made by the heart, not the mind"
i need a hobby   
for being so cold  its actually pretty nice out this morning
i woke up on the complete wrong side of the bed today  i should go back to sleep and see if i wake up on the right side!
going to take a nice hot bath and relax!
went to bed really early last nite   had to get that day done and over with! today is going to be better! maybe i'll get some work   if not theres alot of work to do around the house!
"i hate sitting here in the dungeon  i wanna go to walmart so i can make some banana bread, but i have to stay here and face the music   so lady, hurry the hell up!!"
had one shift at work today  that was great! felt good to help someone! i love what i do for a living!

got out early and still got paid for the full 12 hours!! whoo who! plus i made time and a half for most of it! next week is gonna be big money  working 52 hours!
"i still have 30 mins before i have to leave for 2 hours   im not a big fan of home health care, its boring   but thats where the money's at!!"
i got a new <propfemale> today! hes <propfemale> cute  all black and really loveable! i hope he and hayleigh get along so they can keep eachother company while im at work   oh and he's fixed! thinking about naming him salem from hocus pocus!
"my new kitten, binx, and hayleigh are getting along pretty well, so i think its gonna work out!"
getting ready for my boring and pointless 12 hr shift   hopefully it goes by fast and i get out early again!!!
just a quick thought: why do people have to be so confusing?
so it turns out i was suppose to be in south haven this morning at 7   didnt get there until 9   ooops
"i dont even have to work today, but i still had to wake up early   gotta go turn in my time slips so i get paid!!"
"should i take a nap or not?   ehh, i\ll prolly just end up laying there and getting up in 20 mins anyway"""
wow! 5 o'clock is early!!!

last day in south haven for the week   it should go by pretty fast today   i hope  i think im gonna re-read the twlight books! i didnt get enough of <propfirst> the first time  wink 
"well i tried to nap, but that didnt work   i think im gonna take a nice hot shower and then maybe go to the westside?"
"no work tomorrow  yay!! but i do have to the office tomorrow and get some more training for harder cases, which is cool! and i dont have to wake up early  which is even better!  smile "
im up already! oh well i gotta a lot of shit to take care of today anyway   
"i\ll ask poliet if the the devil needs a ride bc the angel on my right aint hanging out with me tonite"""
"just talked to my angel  i miss him sooo much, i cant wait to see him in just a few more weeks!!"

i need to start working out  my new job has me sitting on my ass all day 
wow am i bored!!!
just got back from hanging out with <propfirst>!
why does 5am have to come soooo early!!
just got home from work  it went by surprising fast today; although i believe it was bc i was completely engrossed in <propfirst>!! (stupid books)
gotta go and turn in my time slips    i miss the days of just punching in and out   so much easier
why does it have to be crappy out on my day off! yesterday was <propfemale> nice!
the sun's out! yay!

"a positive attitude causes a chain reastion of positive thoughts, events, and outcomes  its a catalyst, a spark, that creates extraordinary results"
off to another lovely boring day in south haven! hope today goes by fast like sunday did 
just got home from work   it wasnt too boring today!
"i dont have a phone until friday when i get paid   no minutes  so if anyone wants to get a hold of me, i guess ur just gonna have to fb message me "
"nothing much going on today  im already done with work, so i think im gonna try and take a nap til later"
"wow! i actually ook a nap, a long one too! why the hell is all this underlined??"
another boring day at the house
sooo bored!!
"boy did i screw up  i guess that should have been e playful ected of me, i screw everything up!"
ok im suppose to be falling down my waterfall into my paradise   but i sometimes feel im really tetering at the top of a <propmale> <propmale> about to fall into huge crashing waves throwing me against the sharp rocks and sucking me under the water
"i forgot what it felt like to be up for 24 plus hours  i tried to take a nap, but my phone wont stop beeping!"
"when you depend too much on another person for your own happiness, then you are not really living your own life, are you?"
lets hope today is better than yesterday   bc wow!!
"sometimes you just need someone to remind you of the good things about you, for you to see that about yourself "
damn storm! i lost power and am now late to turn in my time slips!!
happy birthday <propfirst>!!!! i love you sooo much and i cant wait to see you!!!

i moved home knowing i wasnt going back to texas  it wasnt planned   it wasnt what i wanted for <propfirst>
i wanted it for me  and you wanted for you  we are both happier but at our baby's e playful ense   ?
