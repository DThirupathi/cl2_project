how can we set our hearts on heaven when we have an impoverished theology of heaven? - <propfirst> alcorn
"satan need not convince us that heaven doesn't exist, he need only convince us that heaven is a place of boring, unearthly existence  if we believe that lie we'll be robbed of our joy and anticipation, we'll set our minds on this life and not the next; and we won't be motivated to share our faith   - <propfirst> alcorn"

"the essence of grace is that god is not required to give it to us  if you ever feel like god owes it to you, let a light go off in your mind that reminds you that you have just mixed up grace and justice  the hand of god holds us over the pit of hell  and you can't give any reason for god to not drop you into that pit "
