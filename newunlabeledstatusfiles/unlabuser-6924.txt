"please put this on your status if you know, are related to or have been affected by someone who suffers from stupidity  people need to know that stupidity is real & should be taken seriously  there is still no known cure for stupidity, and sympathy does not help but we can raise awareness  93% won't copy and paste this, mainly because they are sufferers themselves and they don't know how to copy and paste "
"people\are often unreasonable, self-centered: forgive them anyway  if you are \honest, people may cheat you, but be honest anyway  what you spend years\to build, someone could destroy overnight  build anyway  the good you \do today, people will often forget tomorrow  do good anyway  you see, in\the final analysis it is    between you and god; it never was between \you and them anyway "
