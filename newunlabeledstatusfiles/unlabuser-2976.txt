a friend is a friend  no matter who their other friends are  no matter who talks down upon them  and a true friend would never try to make you choose or put you in a place where you have to  a friend will tell you when something is wrong and wouldnt want you to be harmed  a friend will take the blame for the other to save them  a friend is hard to find 
one of the hardest things is to get into a relationship  another hard one is keeping the relationship  then breaking up is the easiest thing  but ultimately if you have that special love for that person the hardest thing is being apart from them  we always seem to forgive and then weep for weeks  or months (whatever your thing is)  we hurt  we want them because now no one is filling that love space  you'll be alrite
