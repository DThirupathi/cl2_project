"finally found a way back on to facebook  exciting news, y'all! i gots a girlfuh-riend!!"
"more and more these past two months, i've realized that i should be thanking the inconsiderate bastards who made fun of me all these years ( you know who you are if you can read this ), because in the long run the way they treated me led me to where i am "
uuurgh  i'm really starting to hate not having a job
