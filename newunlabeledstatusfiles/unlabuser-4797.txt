"to live each day with only the memory of a a great feeling and to activley sustain your life for more of those moments is a constant search for \paradise\"" and will ultimatly leave you feeling like hell  i say: learn to enjoy and love life for what it is  """
"deperatly awaiting my demise or greatness     my \life only works when i do\"""""
i just wish    i could stop searching      a endless search for nothing  i just wish i found my spot on the puzzle box 
"you're all wierd, stop looking at me "
spend to much time thinking and the world keeps moving  be like water   just swallow everything   nothing can stop you 
"feels void, once again  where did it all go?"
bored   awake   and hungry         help 
my little sweets   i miss them   when i get hte apartment together and i am doing better i will send for them for 4 days    well go to the parks together    
it happens today and something will happen tomorrow  fight it     or flow with it    it still will happen    
daiqueries tonight     yay for me    
"says, the foggiest evening shall ascend upon you and leave you with thought of new beginings and you'll say feelings of never lasting peace and unrest of your heart and soul   the mist will spray and the people you know will be gone    "
if you're cold i'll keep you warm and if you're alone  just hold on because i'll just be your safety      i'll be your home
dear world   lights out    on kirkman    call me     if you need a net   a home   cheers
the needle makes a hole with a familiar stain    what have i become  sweetest friend?
"there is never any place for someone like me to be totally happy    i'm running out of clock, somethings never do change   "
sometimes it's ok to retreat    and sometimes it's fatal      sadly disappointed
thinks he doesn't want to work today and that it will be     depressing
eat my pouss bla lbah blah blah blaaaaaaaa
betterr
into the ocean;end it all 
i don't get it    i hate it    i wish it would all go away    the tears would turn to razors and it would be ok
good night   may the dark leave me behind and light blast me in the face   with burning sensations
head hurts      going work
striped and polish i'm brand new    whats your fantasy
home and tired  
drag     
g'night cruel world 
fault;blame not me but the maker for its' flaws 
<propmale> over and thinking       it hurts
has plenty to do and no one to do it with     watching the days go by   
boo work    and boo i have to be there at 7am tomorrow   
"tonight, a night of nights! awake and sleeping seem to fall in one hand and tarty stags in the other   "
believes daunting and grim lines are drawn to save the helpless not needy
"in all your daily love,seleflessness* breaks in  wholeness will forever <propmale> you   "
you're all that i've hoped to find in every single way and everything i would give is everything you couldn't take cause nothing feels like home you're a thousand <propmale> away and the hardest part of living is taking breathes to stay cause i know i'm good for something i just haven't found it yet but i need it 
"if i could cheer the whole i would  if i could ever make myself happy i would  left overs are all i have  everything i would give is nothing you will take    i've given all i have to bare    stripped and alone    (i'm fine, just food for thought ) leave me alone "
is sick    booo: sad 
i'm always blank 
just about to cook dinner     and finish laundry like a good house boy (sigh)
happy thanksgiving   
feels like crap ugh!
straight to the non-gayness of my homo erotic tendancies and love for the male body   jeeez i wish i was wasn't so gay straight acting
home from work 
"coooked breakfast, washed dishes and put up xmas decorations       now doing laundry and playing a video game"
it is my most thoughtful hope that my roommates make it home soon and safe  i'm thinking of you until you are home  be brave!
if you could be with someone who made the world seem more kind  if they made you feel love drunk of thoughtlessness  would you be willing to place your life on a board meant for long term suffering to prove you will not live without them?       sounds like crack to me  be free!
dill   nill    dookie bills    life is full of shit     so <propmale> in it for a while til you pass out from the smell and well    yea
on my way out for an evening of hopeful fun and no booty   
all <propmale> green does is sleep    10-15 hrs per day!!!
high rise flesh rips at the sight of your face!
going to school with <propfirst>
<propmale> is a dirty liar   and i hate it  fucking people!! why can't they all be like kene and just tell you like it is    ugh! f**ing stupid people!
getting sleepy    time to move and get some work around the apartment done 
through the high winds of the falling gravity;lost in my own mind
"ugh    woke up at 9am to clean the house while <propmale> sleeps    then woke him to pay rent, grocery shop, and hit the bank up so he can drop off his checks     but he insists that he sleep     dam fucking kid  plans all to ruins "

"with my one last dying breath i'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt  through and through my head hits the ground and it seems to bounce back up, just uglier than before"
ever see a pit? ever fall in one? one that echoes for <propmale> 
good night with <propfirst> and <propfemale>  thank you  awsome  wish it was longer    here i come miami baby!
disheartened
stalemate  the path isn't what it seems  run to the unknown and take what comes and what be will be 
i just want to >< $%$#%$ out of certin people     
i think most people acknowledge that they have problems to themselves  i find it more uncommon for us to share them with others as it is our instinctive nature to not show them  we are a dog eat dog world and problems can be associated with weakness and in our world the weak ones get left behind to the vultures  good luck getting those whom you call close to even share their most secret  issues   interesting    k yo
"it was a great night, <propmale> to all who made it happen    "
bored    hate me today     hate me tomorrow   hate me for all the things i didn't do for you

"it is a river, a razor, a hunger, a endless need, a flower, and it is for the lucky    what am i?      you can have it if you get it    "
the path leads no where; where you stop is some where    
"'tis without assumption that the steepness hangs me by a finger  whilst thy heart and mind stay true, their gaze draws to the dirt  leave it all alone and you will always be alone "
<propfemale> shots with rum and coke     oh the greatness at the bottom   
"war is a dleight to those who have had no e playful erience of it~ desiderius erasmus   and not only would it be my honor to die for you but i'd gladly suffer through it so long as my people can live in peace and free of tyranny  thank you, the unknown for your sacrifice"

i'm always watching the history and discovery channel  lame 
"i've just completed another day of work at a sub shop    and it was great  clock in, work, clock out and everyone is just as happy to see me leave as they are to see me arrive    outstanding "
you suck  you make me feel things that are not good  you're becoming  this pressure in my eye that wants to burst all over you whenever i know  you are not telling me the whole truth or a lie

"if there were ever a moment, a time, it is now  barren, stripped, awkward, vulnerable but resilient  now would be that time to shame me for my misdeeds  i accept all judgment for effects that i have caused  i am not without hope  dare i say, it is all i have left when all others have walked away  the world will not turn until i have suffered for as long as i should  it will get worse before it gets better "
"this will be the beginning of renewed hope should i make it through the \torment with a breath of air in my lungs  may i have mercy on myself "
"i want to party   who's got something going on tonight?\i'm up for about anything!!!!"
