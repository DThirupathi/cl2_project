the road to successis not straight  there is a curve called failure  loop called confusion  speed bumps called friends  red lights called enemies  caution light called family  you will have flat tires called jobs  but if you have a spare called determination  an engine called preservance  a driver called god  you will make it to a place called success 
"people need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness,so there is no cure & it's not contagious  they only want what we all want, to be accepted, 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this  will you be in the 7 % that will, and leave it on your status for least an hour  it's special education week"
