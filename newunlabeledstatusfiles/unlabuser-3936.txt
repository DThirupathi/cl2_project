"skipping teachers conferences, not calling your kids, and passing them off on the first available family member does not make you a dad  playing candyland, i spy, rock paper scissors (500x's), helping them with their homework, caring for them when they are sick or hurt, and being there for them does  i hope you know what your throwing away  lucky for me it's my gain!"

"tonight's agenda - <propfirst> oldham a k a  my \client\"" will subject himself to being interviewed for the sake of my passing grade!! <propfirst> i promise to erase the recording as soon as class is over so there will be no incriminating evidence hanging around for when you run for gov'na   maybe!  smile """
uuughhh this whole week can just die
"errands are finally done, now onward to homework and cleaning so the kids can go sledding tomorrow  (they've been threatened, no clean room   no sledding)"
all too often people tell me things in confidence  i never betray  (in fact i consider it good practice for when i will be bound by dr  patient confidentiality ) yet when i let down my own guard and confide in them they feel it necessary to let the world know    makes me want to start spilling their secrets   and damn do i have some good ones!!
"7 article reviews, a 5 <propfemale> paper, girl scout cookie orders collected & submitted, a girl scout meeting, 2 dr  appointments, a 4 hour drive to oneonta to drop the kids w their dad, and baking 2 pies for a ski patrol pot luck on saturday means i get to spend my birthday finishing my homework instead of snowboarding  sad  boo"
thank you everyone for all the birthday wishes!
thank you everyone so so much for all the birthday wishes!! i had a fantastic day that was only made better by all of you!!! xoxoxo

?????????? happy <propfirst>'s day ??????????
"heard today - \when you asked if you could go back to school    \"" ummm i didn\""t ask! i told! and the telling was done out of courtesy because once i get my degree     in a field that has nothing to do with insurance    i'm out! besides why would i need my managers (or bosses) approval for returning to school??? thats right!! i don't!!"""
gots myself some new boarding boots! would much rather be out breaking them in    but responsible me is at work  sad 
"hi ho hi ho   it's off to girl scouts i go, but hey it's world thinking day, get to teach my lil munchkins all about that!"
"my adorable man had me up so early this morning i actually had time to make waffles with mascarpone, fresh berries, and <propfemale> before work     he claims he just couldn't sleep     somehow i think getting me to make him waffles was the master plan!"
think of someone you know or love who has had cancer  my prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found  will you post it? just one hour  do it for all of us  there are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it  i hope to see this in the status of all my friends

i realize it is the law to stop for people in a crosswalk but it does not apply if they are crossing the crosswalk of a side street  so thank you mister for slamming on your brakes in the middle of a snow storm causing me to skid 10 ft into the back of your tailer hitch  i am so glad that your truck is fine but my bumber is not  had you moved 1 ft forward this could have never happened  <propmale>
