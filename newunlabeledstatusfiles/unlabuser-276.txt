"that peaceful night, tears in both our eyes, seperating truths and lies, sobbing silently, while i give my quiet plea, just to forget, all of my deepest regrets, taking the strands of time to twist, and resist, a fallen, broken heart, our words, now torn apart, writhe in the sunset's agony, tangling <propfemale>   "

someone tell me y i have chorus songs from 2 years ago stuck in my head!!!
"i woke up early, but now i'm sleeping in; my head aloft in the clouds, dark thundering clouds, sending a lightning bolt down to earth, striking the souls of every living beast, saving the worst fucked up soul for last, my own  crushing the skulls of the innocent, for the lies i tell have been thrown in my face, too many times  i've been abandoned, forgotten as if i were only a day of someone else's life   "
words hurt and hate   
life is at a standstill; i barely notice the days passing   
"i remain ignored, secluded from these strange beings    i always knew i was different, that i didn't belong  i don't mind not fitting in, just the resentment is a torch to my heart   "

"masked by who i once was, i wait around the corner, lurking  you pass by me, smiling at the friendly face you see  and yet, my diguise is wearing thin, and you begin to notice the change  i avoid you, in hopes to replace these chipping layers, but every coat of paint fades in the sun  so i reside in the shadows    love "
"the melancholic eyes of a traitor  looking down, avoidning reality's gaze  heavy fog around glassy stares  blank but longing looks out the window  waiting patiently    love "
"time passed and the skies darkened  the day came to a bitter end, bright in the fiery inferno of the setting sun  and i remembered just how tired i was  yawning, and trying to shake the sleep from my slowly closing eyes, i layed my head down for only a minute  i didn't want to doze off this early, and yet, i couldn't escape the sleep     love  zzzzzzzzz"
"everyone glances at me with intrigue and curiousity  but i'm not flattered  i'm alienated, and passed around from person to person  they can't see what i know  i know that every look is hateful, and that every word on their tongues will hurt if spoken  i'm not like everyone else  i just have to accept it    love "
