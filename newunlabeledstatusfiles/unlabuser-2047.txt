happy new year!
off for a walk
should be cleaning instead of checking fb
spent a cozy evening with the in-laws learning how to make wine 
had a fantastic first day of work
"snow storm, spa day, christmas, i like december     "
so many nice people in aspen     
back to cat hair and no magically appearing bedtime snack  reality can be so cruel 
snow day!!!!
"making real hot chocolate, with milk, and the stove  after that maybe i'll start recruiting for a pizza night     "
is wondering what possessed the flight attendant to try to convince me that orange juice is much better than coffee      i would have thought it would have been easy for him to see i'd been up all night and might snap without caffeine     
must study     
working     
i heard a 10 year old recite 49 digits of pi at the airport  groovy     
i love my new phone 
loving the belvedere's dollar kobe sliders
"hmmmm, people from a local church just brought their children to our door and forced us to take a bag of canned goods  i guess because i don't choose to live in the suburbs i'm starving and should be grateful for corn syrup laden food? i'm confused     "
loving my new ipad  best husband ever!
thank you do much for all the birthday wishes  you helped make it a fantastic day!
