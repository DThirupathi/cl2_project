"won't be on here for at least the next month   most of the phd programs i'm preparing applications for have acceptance rates between 2% and 6%   that, along with my regular class work, 2 research assistant jobs, and teaching assistant work, means no time for fb until dec  15th   if you want to talk, call or email me "
"why do people gossip & twist around things others say to sound more sinister and interesting?  and why do others believe it, then act passive aggressive & bitchy rather than confronting the person & asking what was actually said?  most of us past middle school are too busy to waste time maligning othersâ€™ character and talking shit   lifeâ€™s too short to waste it treating your own friends & family like crap "
"yay!  joyful  just got my first phd program interview, and it's to the most selective school i applied to (2% acceptance rate)   i wasn't even e playful ecting to hear anything from schools until feb  what a great sign!"
