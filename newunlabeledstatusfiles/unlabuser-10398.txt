"wouldn't be surprised if another ice storm popped up tonight and canceled school for the rest of the week  there are just some weeks you wish you could repeat over and over, last week, only having one day of school, was one of those weeks "

the world is full of idiots  prime example; as i was driving through the parking lot after school today some idiot kid (it was malaki stevens) thought he'd be 'funny' and pretended to jump in front of my car  then when i slammed the brakes and glared at him he flipped me off like it was all my fault to begin with
