"and we know its never simple, never easy, never a clean break, no one here to save me, i cant breathe without you, but i have to"
"the facebook trick: press up,up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, enter key, then right click then press up and down and magic crcles will appear  the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page   it will work! put this as your status if it works "

is coloring easter eggs  smile 
"a smile costs nothing but gives much  it en<propmale>es those who receive without making poorer those who give  it takes a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever  none is so <propmale> or mighty that he cannot get along without it and none is so poor that he cannot be made <propmale> by it  yet a smile cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away "
"often people attempt to live their lives backwards; they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so they will be happier  the way it actually works is the reverse  you must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want "
"nothing lasts forever so live it up, laugh it off, take chances, and never have regrets, because at one point everything you did was exactly what you wanted  love "
"   maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back,maybe, you have to let go of who you are to become who you will be  love "
"i've been walked on, used, and forgotten and i don't regret one moment of it, because in those moments, i've learned alot  i've learned how to tell when people are lying and when people are sincere  i've learned how to be a teenager, and how to grow up when i need to and i wont ever take what i have for granted  this is life, live it one day at a time  because you never know how many days you got left "
"fish are food, not friends  love "
"nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending "
skypeee  love 
"sometimes you just have to smile and pretend everything is okay, hold back your tears, and just walk away"
"there comes a point in your life when you realize who matters, who never did, who won't anymore, and who always will so don't worry about the people from your past because there's a reason they didnt make it into your future  love "

i love <propfemale> with all my heart love 
it breaks my heart; it makes me sad to think of all the times we had  you made me laugh and you made me cry  and all that i can do is sigh and wonder why  annoyed 
"remember all the times we've had together, what happened to being best friends forever?  sad  texxxt "
"we all lose friends   we lose them in death, to distance and over time  but even though they may be lost, hope is not  the key is to keep them in your heart, and when the time is right, you can pick up the friendship right where you left off "
a simple friend thinks the friendship over when you have an argument  a real friend knows that it's not a friendship until after you've had a fight  annoyed 
sometimes we need to be hurt in order to grow  we must fail in order to know we must lose in order to gain  some lessons are learned best through pain   annoyed
