crunch-a-tize me captain?
"i think i saw you in my sleep, darling,\i think i saw you in my dreams you were\stitching up the seams on every broken promise\that your body couldn't keep \i think i saw you in my sleep "
"i recall once on the church steps,\when i moved to kiss your chest,\how we paid such close attention\to each sweet and stuttered breath, \i shouldâ€™ve stopped to paint our picture,\captured honest pure affection,\just to document the difference \between attraction and connection "
"oh, how selfish of myself to always say that it was more than i could take,\like it was pain i could not shake, \like it could break me with its fingers, throw my body in the lake, \and i would slowly sink away, \but the truth is it was sorrow that i made and would not face "
"see, i keep falling for the future after tripping on the past \and i am always tearing sutures out to make the anguish last like it defines me \or reminds me i've found comfort in my suffering\and uncertainty in happiness and death, \because what's next is such a mystery to me \i am terrified of all the things i feel but cannot see "
"we held a match to keep our sight on the path\but the flame gave up and we lost it\and i've knelt for the last three years\trying to find it back with the blackened matchstick\today i'm not afraid of failure\the past is a flower\the future, the snow\i wasn't ever close to perfect\but i never let you go"
"we are the lovers, we are the last of our kind  \link your arms and keep your <propfemale> up \and i swear that we'll be fine \we are the lovers, we are the last of our kind  \though we're not sure who we are, though we're not sure where we're from, \though we're not sure when we'll leave, though we're not sure where we'll go,\we keep our heads up,\we keep our hearts up,\we keep our hopes up "
"<propmale> me the serenity \to accept the things i cannot change; \courage to change the things i can;\and the wisdom to know the difference "
"oh i like you so very much so much in fact i gotta wake you up\itâ€™s not that i have words to speak\i just wanna see you looking at me\in a way, that states\in an hour when the sun comes up\weâ€™re gonna put on our shoes weâ€™re gonna shake the dust"
"if you fall, iâ€™ll welcome you with open arms into the dark night\i might seem cold but underneath\i am just as scared and sad as you, and if you stay a while you'll find\that i just want to make you smile "
"pick a path though it shadows over mine\these city lights spread like cancer on the skyline\clear your sights of all the habits that are mine\when you get tired, you will never ever love again\or ever love again \so <propfemale> on   "
"i dont know why, i like you \i just know i cant stop thinking of you\oh wait!\its cause you make me smile,\you always make me smile  smile "
