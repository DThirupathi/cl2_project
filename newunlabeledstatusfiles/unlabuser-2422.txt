-- is it possible to know what you have when you have it?
imagine a future moment in your life where all your dreams come true  you know it's the greatest moment of your life and you get to e playful erience it with one person  who's standing next to you?
"happiness comes in many forms -- in the company of good friends, in the feeling you get when you make someone else's dream come true, or in the promise of hope renewed  it's okay to let yourself be happy because you never know how fleeting that happiness might be "
