hereâ€™s a little fact that came out today during the dispersants hearings in washington:   the idiots (noaa and fda) that are in charge of testing gulf seafood toxicity levels are only testing for oil and oil byproducts   presently they are not testing for dispersants or dispersant byproducts   the noaa assistant secretary thinks that testing for dispersant â€œwould be an excellent thing to consider â€�   hmmâ€¦ ya think?
sooo   we are on a road trip!  maybe itâ€™s just meâ€¦but a place named â€œdry creek water parkâ€� doesnâ€™t sound like much fun    surprise )
