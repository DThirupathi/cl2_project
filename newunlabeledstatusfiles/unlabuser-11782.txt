a few more days of olympics and then the sleep schedule is back to normal
why do i give tests? it only means i have to grade them    all 135 of them  however i did get some funny answers on the test
"no, i don't hate your child, no i don't play favorites, your child got a b c whatever because they earned it not because i felt like giving it to them, yes i have the proof in my gradebook, theyare not going to be perfect all the time no matter how intelligent they are  that is all!"
"is completely finished and spent  i hope it only goes up from here  to you all from work: i should have gotten a bigger hot fudge sundae, a much bigger hot fudge sundae "
ok maybe i'll get really lucky and everything that happened this week will magically be gone when i get to work on monday  that would make life so much easier! or i could just relieve saturday and sunday over and over again so monday doesn't have to come!
"much better day today! well, for the most part"

it's always a great day when you smell something burning in your classroom and you realize the funny sounds from the computer might mean something is wrong!
one more day until a fabulous but short spring break!
life is chaotic and beautiful!

"sore throat and ear ache but today was absolutely wonderful! gracias a ti mi amor, <propmale>!"
not being able to hear well because of stuffed up ears does have it's benefits  smile 
plugged up ears turn into a sore throat which turns into me losing my voice  why does this happen like 4 times a year? plus side: my class is really quiet because i told them every noise sounds like lots of people talking and it makes my head hurt  at least the students are sympathetic!
darn ear infections! another day home tomorrow  sad

finally time for a break! brownies in the oven and then it's off to eat dinner with mi amor  smile 
advice of the day don't send a text as you walk out the door  it can lead to you getting locked out of the house and your car
christmas song of the day: <propfemale> claus go straight to the ghetto by <propfirst> brown  that's all i have to say 
"making rolls, potatoes and succotash! then it's off to <propfemale>'s"
what are most people doing after eating today? sleeping  what am i doing? hanging out at wal mart waiting to buy stuff
"black friday was a success! i have everything to put on the tree, now i need the tree  smile "
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas!
is thinking tomorrow is a great time to start my tradition of reading the book of <propmale>  during the month of december! yay for december!!!
"done christmas shopping! well, except for one present  and did i grade the papers i planned to? nope of course not, i did a lot of reading though!"
ok i have all the pampered chef stuff people ordered  now it's a matter of getting it to everyone! let me know what's easiest for all of you please
should be at the gym but not up to it with the sneezing today  guess i'll have to buy things to make cookies instead  smile 
"is really wishing there would be snow on the ground so i have an excuse to eat brownies and cuddle up with a book, blanket and movie! too bad mi amor is sick or he could join me!"
"after an interesting weekend, it's off to bed in hopes to get through the next two weeks before the break!"
so i bought a grapefruit knife from pampered chef   it's now my new favorite kitchen tool ever!!
2 episodes of psych tonight! and life is still confusing  sad 
"\we are happiest when our lives are connected to others through unselfish love and service \"" elder wirthlin"""
happy that christmas is coming   not happy about the eye
loves pajama day at school! and the last day before break
i love reading <propmale>! just finished chapter 23! interesting reading about the crucifixion of christ right before we celebrate his birth and realizing that his birth is what makes our life and our joy possible! what a glorious season this is!
"<propfemale> christmas! busy getting the house ready! presents are all wrapped and ready to go, baking is being started!"
so the guys won the gingerbread house competition but they also used carrots and broccoli so i don't know if it counts!
"me: elf is on tv again this week and christmas is over \william: i know! it's great!\me: but you just told me that i couldn't watch any christmas movies \william: elf isn't a christmas movie!\when a movie is titled elf and <propfemale> claus is in it, then clearly it should be a christmas movie  but apparently that's just me"
so anyone on frontierville who can send gifts if you could send me hammers or hand drills or paint that would be great! thanks!
"dishes cleaned, kitchen clean now i can have fun the rest of the week!"
cannot believe how fast the break has gone or the year! good thing i have my resolutions; if only i can keep them!
hoping it's a wonderful new year!
do i really have to go back tomorrow? not that i don't love work but i want a little longer time to have a vacation 
"let's see how creative my facebook friends are    leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name    it can only be 1 word    then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you    don't just post a word & not copy, that's just lame!"
sending out hugs cause i sure need them myself! what an odd week it's been  that is all  annoyed 
very very sleepy and ready to curl up in bed with my book 
made grapefruit bars   now they need to cool so i can see how they taste!
grapefruit bars: good but need a way to get more grapefruit flavor into them   feeling happy today amidst pondering   
what a wonderful sunday! i love <propmale> conference!
helping someone who can't help themself is the hardest thing i've ever done but knowing i've done the best i can is wonderful
loving my snow day! almost time to head out and get the things i need for the day   
lovely evening con mi amor
confuzzled but it's going to be just fine
"ether 12:27: and if men come unto me i will show unto them their weakness  i give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will i make weak things become strong unto them \this is what i'm living by this week!"
saw tron tonight    good distraction but now the thoughts are still with me    
"pondering life at the moment and extremely exhausted, thank goodness i have tomorrow off!"
is wishing life were somehow easier although then we couldn't really be tested so that defeats the purpose   outwitted myself again  smile 
wondering why we hurt the people we care about the most
"ok time to play guess that song \simple really isn't it a word or two and then a lifetime of not knowing where or why or how or when\"""""

learning all kinds of cool things from my students by reading their biography projects! i now know lots about <propmale> cousteau and sacagawea
rainy gray day outside but it was a good one   
i wonder what life would be like    (finish the sentence)
"asked the primary during singing time today \cual es uno de los dones mas grande que dios nos dio?\"" first answer: \""jesucristo\"" second: \""la vida\"" what a great primary we have!"""
"why is it i have \me and <propfirst> down by the schoolyard\"" stuck in my head?"""
"if you'll be my bodyguard, i can be your long lost pal   "
