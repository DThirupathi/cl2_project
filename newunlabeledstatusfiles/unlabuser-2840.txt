"i absolutely, positively, verily, sincerely, truly love college so very, very much that i can not convey my love with mere words  how can i describe it then, being so beyond words   i feel like i could drift away on a cloud into eternal bliss  i am so very happy  i must stay grounded now, lest i swoon  why describe my love of college with such passion? why else, but for i am a man of great passion "
"7 more days   it didn't help that i was tired of break before it even started   i need to learn to live in the present   uggh, i don't like the present   i guess i can look toward the future   i truly am a rare specimen   how many people consider a school break torturous, anticipating the day school starts up again like it's christmas   oh no, not christmas break   i wish i could bring my friends with me on break "
"someone told me that going home isn't so bad, because you become a guest in your own home   since you're a guest, you don't have to do chores and things   guess what?!  i'm doing chores   i'm feeling a little too at home   i wanna go back to school   snap out of it dawson!!!  quit complaining!  you have a wonderful life   you're very loved  quit being selfish and enjoy your life!"

"i am thankful for everything that has happened in my life, be it good or bad, joyful or sorrowful, loving or hurtful, because everything that has happened to me has molded me into what i am today "
"perhaps it was the the enforcement of school uniforms and strict discipline of the private school that camouflaged my identity   no one knew my true love of discipline, my strict code of ethics, for my will and determination was masked by the obligations of others   now in my new life, i stand out, for i work just as hard to maintain my code of ethics "

"it's so simple   why is this not documented?  the meaning of life is love!  agape, philio, eros  love of the creator and creation; love of your brothers, your sisters, your family and friends; love of a dear one held close to your heart, your closest companion  why is this fact not taught in schools? why is it not taught to children as existential knowledge? listen up people! the meaning of life is love  case closed!"

"why does it seem like everyone is in such a big hurry? why am i always the last one out the door? i've always been labeled as being slow  but, i don't want to be in a constant rush  i want to take in every moment of every day; let it all sink in  maybe i don't do as many things in one day as others, but the things i do, are done far more efficiently  live life in its fullest; take note of the things around you "

"i am a great admirer of women, and i have found that there is far too much diversity between each one to ever hope placing them all into one simple definition outside of a homosapien built for bearing children   excuse me for the crude definition, but it is really only that and a difference in hormone production that separates men and women "

"why? why must a musician work so hard, and receive such little credit?  not only must i attend classes and do homework, but my free-time is consumed with practicing   not only do i love music, but i also love math--which also is very time consuming   why do i continue on in this way?  simple   mathematicians work hard to make life a little easier, musicians work hard to make life a little more pleasant "
"i don't want to hear anymore complaining about the snow   it's beautiful, you don't control the weather, enjoy it   it is still winter, spring does not start until the 20th   fine   go ahead, shake your fists at the sky   just don't dull the mood for the rest of us who are very much enjoying this lovely, white day "
"why am i so tenaciously passionate about learning?  now not only do i want to be a music math <propmale>, psychology and music performance minor, but now i want to be a philosophy and computer science minor too   that would leave me with 2 <propmale>s and 4 minors   maybe i should hold back a little until grad school   but i don't want to wait   life on earth can be cruel, on either side of the railroad tracks "
"the eye of a painter, the ear of a musician, the nose of a flourist, the tastebuds of a chef, the touch of a loving mother, all these things miraculous and lovely, these things, together, are what tie us to this world   they tie us to this world, but the ties to others, to those we hold dear, those ties are held by something beyond the 5 senses, something much deeper "
