my birthday is tomorrow  just thought i'd remind everyone  wink wink 
make christmas go away
"had to see both my doctor and dentist today  bad news from both  looks like the doctor won't sign a release for me to go back to work   which makes it damn hard to pay for the dentist  i have a toothache, no job, no money, no life   but at least i got some pain pills out of the deal, right?"
my anxiety is through the roof  there's not enough alcohol for this   
hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable 
"i hate being an adult  fortunately, i'm not mentally stable enough to qualify as a functioning adult  too bad these insurance people haven't figured that out yet "
"if i could close my eyes and make it end\i'd never open my eyes again"
tomorrow  get together  my house  wanna come? come!
wanna <propfemale> out?
i'm sorry 
"rip\three of the bunnies died today "
"the way i look is never going to change \so quit fucking staring and saying shit like you mean anything \teach your kids fucking respect \it's 2011, not 1950   as my mom shared today \this is how i look \deal with it "
"just when i don't think things could get any worse   they always do   \someone stole my identity \as if i wasn't screwed enough without having some cunt use my information to not just destroy my life, but to make hers better \playing on the railroad tracks sounds more appealing everyday "
please  make  it  stop 
i feel very alone right now   
it's like i don't even exist 
what's up tonight?
playing dress up today  who wants to play with me?
going on a picnic today 
"i know i've been bad with responding or even talking to anyone really  it's nothing personal   it's just me  i'm pretty much avoiding everyone at the moment  i have over 15 messages in my inbox, all of them unread  as i said, don't take it personal   it's my problem, not yours   "
the only reason i am sitting here watching celebrity apprentice because my childhood crush on meatloaf has never died 
<propfemale>'s next top model   i love the way it makes me hate myself 
"random fact of the day -- i undress with my window open everyday  even at night with my lights on, when everyone can clearly see me  i figure   if you don't want to see it, then don't look     at least i'm making some teenage boys dream come true   "
i'm all dressed up with nowhere to go   
"if anyone else wants to be lame with me, feel free to come over "
"i'm so green today, i should change my name to <propmale> the frog "
i need someone to take me to club tattoo as soon as possible  it's very important to me and i'd really appreciate it  please 
"i don't know what's going on with my job and i need some cash  if you know a way to get some quick, let me know "
asshole of the year award goes to ---- me 
"don't worry   soon enough, you won't have to deal with me   sooner than you think   "
"well, i guess it's time to play dirty  fortunately, i've always been good at being vindictive "
i'm sorry i've been crazier than usual 
anyone wanna come over tonight?
"i really, really, really hate myself right now  more than usual "
