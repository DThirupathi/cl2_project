"okay, i made the cookies  i found something out about myself in the process: i hate baking alone and i suck at baking all together! the funny thing is though    i found it oddly amusing! lololol"
i realized this morning when i tried a cookie i made last night    somehow the ending taste was like biting into a fish
i got books to read again! thanks aunt steph

"<propfirst> fixed my computer! i realized this moring however, that i enjoyed not having it! not needing to worry about updating and email checking and crap     being free was nice  but it's even nicer to be back online lol"
"<propmale> caught a mouse! we praised him for a little bit (like two minutes) then we all went to do something else  <propmale> caught it, but <propfirst> killed it with reynen's slipper- don't tell her, <propfemale>?"
killed a mouse  the girls screamed for me to just hit  i finally gave the death-blow with a promise of <propfemale> as a reward  i feel horrible!!!!!!!
going to dad's tomorrow  he's gonna flip out when he sees the girls' haircuts!
"four hours of mixing dirt in <propmale> and plastic pots, then spending thirty more minutes removing everything i put away just to properly clean out the greenhouse and the awesome-me part is that mom doesn't e playful ect a clean greenhouse, just mixed dirt  it was alright, until i found spider web in my hair "
opened the windows in the library the front door and <propmale> and i spent two hours outside while i read a book about cadavers and he napped  it's beautiful outside  i'll kick the girls outside when they get home 
"because of my 'caring' sisters, mom and <propfirst> had to drain the pond and refill it- what fun! <propfirst> had me remove the nails from the pieces of wood to keep the plastic on the greenhouse walls  then, because of the winter season, mom, <propfirst>, and i re-plasticed the greenhouse  the girls and i cleaned the kitchen and reynen helped me with the hammock for the front porch  now, we're eating popcorn and watching a movie "
"kicked off the shoes and climbed on top of the greenhouse to clear away the leaves  it was wobbly but interesting  got a couple looks from passer-by, lol  cleaned up the backyard best i could "
shocked the crap out of mom when she saw i cleaned up a pile of junk that had tipped over in the wheelburrow  made me laugh 
dayne and i might be bunking together tonight because she's afraid of the thunder and lightning  she better not hog the covers! reynen's mad at me and i don't know why she is this time

"in new orleans and <propmale> is hurting himself already! lol \we toured today and had dinner at a <propfemale> <propfemale> diner- my idea and it was proven a good one too \our hotel has two pools, haunted, and is beautiful and easy to find  we're by french market and the bugs don't come out because it's too freaking hot here for them! love it!"
"back home from new orleans and got the pics up finally after nearly two hours of uploading  family reunion this weekend  see you pupps saturday morning sometime, hopefully before noon lunch- don't want to miss that of course!"
