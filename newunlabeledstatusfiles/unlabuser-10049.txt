"i feel it's gonna rain like this for days, so let it rain down and wash everything away i hope that tomorrow the sun will shine, with every tomorrow comes another life   "
"so i speak to you in riddles because my words get in my way  i smoke the whole thing to my head and feel it wash away 'cause i can't take anymore, or this, i want to come apart or dig myself a little hole inside your precious heart   "
"in the full <propfemale>'s light i listen to the sea, and in between the silence, hear you calling me, but i don't know where i am, and i don't trust who i fear, but if i dont wanna, will i hear them leave?"
"a girl writes about the special bond between her and her sisters  they are not always together in place but they are always together in spirit  sometimes they fight, but nothing will ever break their special bond "
i guess i have been really sleep deprived because i physicaly turned off my alarm in my sleep     i havent done that in a long time    my body really wanted sleep and it wasnt taking no for an anwser   
"to the outside world we all grow old   but not to brothers and sisters   we know each other as we always were   we know each other's hearts   we share private family jokes   we remember family feuds and secrets, family griefs and joys   we live outside the touch of time   ~clara ortega beta psi <propfemale> now and forever!"

our brothers and sisters are there with us from the <propfemale> of our personal stories to the inevitable dusk  ~susan scarf merrell
"we all wish to re-live memories  but if we close our eyes, think hard enough, and imagine, the memory can become real once more   "
"i never thought that i had anymore to give, you're pushing me so far here i am without you, drink to all that we have lost, mistakes we have made, everything will change but,love remains the same     that is the hardest part"
is remembering when she still felt safe and protected    that nothin in the world could ever harm her
"the best type of love is beta love  smile  and nothing in the world can beat that    beta psi <propfemale> & beta sigma <propfemale>   we are one in the same, happy to say i'm beta made "
there's nothing you can make that can't be made  no one you can save that can't be saved  nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time - it's easy  all you need is love ~ to all my betas! ?
"put your faith in what you most believe in, two worlds, one family trust your heart, let fate decide, to guide these lives we see"
i give my whole heart to everythin i do and i jzt end up getting hurt   im done    im tired of the reappearing knife and my hands being numb    im done

"according to urbandictionary com this is wat my name means:  1) a person who is very hot and has the greatest personality ever! in hebrew <propfemale> means <propfemale>  there for you should treat her as if she was one! <propfemale> is also a very irresistable person  2) the best person you'll ever meet, not a slut or a hoe, but a gorgeous human being  well loved by many, feared by tons! she is positively gorgeous, fear her"
"had an amazing day with my sisters!!!! i really needed it     who ever came up with the saying \no pain no gain\"" was totally wrong    i had no pain today and gained do much    whereas when there is pain i don't gain anything but more pain     no pain is a good thing to feel    """
saw dear <propfirst> today with my sisters    it was a good movie   although they could have had a better ending    but overall    great movie     
people really need to grow up these days   i am so tired of immature people   
when it seems all your dreams come undone we will stand by your side filled with hope and filled with pride we are more than we are we are one!
i let the voices spill out from my veins onto the virgin canvas until nothing is left to drain

i've gotta fight today to live another day    i'm gonna fight for what's right today     i'm speaking my mind and if it kills me tonight    i will be ready to die
   all my life i prayed for someone like you and i thank god that i  that i finally found you    
a massive amount of energy radiates off your every fiber of being and absorbs my essence   
im falling down the rabbit hole into a dark ibis   i dont know which was is up and i cant hear the clock ticking anymore     temptation is knocking on the door and i want to let it in     do i dare?
i am just done with everything   im so fed up with this life and i need to escape    i dont care anymore     im jumping and where ever i land i land   if i dont make it then that is what was meant to be    
it's the moment of truth and the moment to lie the moment to live and the moment to die   this is war
jaming out to kareoke with my best friend in the world     nothin can stop us now!!!!!
"the thing we plague ourselves with is a thing of our own imagination  if we do not anticipate it, it is not there "
"you may think you see who i really am but you'll never know me   every day, is as if i play a part   now i see if i wear a mask i can fool the world   but i can not fool my heart"
celebrating my brother's birthday early and going for a bike ride with my lil sis while we enjoy the spring air     carpe diem!!!
you take my breath away every time   and u dont even know how fast i am falling    
when my world is falling apart   when there's no light to break up the dark    that's when i look at you    and you love me for who i am    you know who you are out there   
my heart is at peace     
the past is the past you know canâ€™t worry bout the past caz that was yesterday    itâ€™s a new day bro   imma put it on the line caz itâ€™s my time   my day     gotta do it now
"only surrender will help you now   i love you, please see and believe again    "
"i said i've seen paradise before, but last night showed me that paradise was only a pit stop on this journey   thank you to all who made that possible!"
wats the point in worrying?? everything happens for a reason right??? so if everything is meant to be y worry?? you jzt gotta live ur life like ur dying and go with the flow!
people say that the eyes are the gateway to a person's soul   the moment i looked into your eyes is the moment everything changed and now i cant live without you in my life    if only you knew    
i want to be another vital body part that you need to survive and not jzt another pretty face    so if all you want is jzt another face i'm sorry but your out of luck      
"*a warning to the people*: the good and the evil, the prophet, the liar, the honest, the messiah     i believe in nothing   not in satan, not in peace and not in war   i believe in nothing but the beating of our hearts"
*warning* im gonna be fucking people up real soon so stay outa my way!!
leave it all behind    your past and mind    let's go where we got to    our paths will cross again in time    it's never the same tomorrow   and tomorrow's never clear   so come on lets go   our time is here    
"my feelings for you are complicated, the only thing i know is you make me smile and i will continue to fight for that"
i loved the way you felt so strong and how you always made me smile   i never wanted to leave    i miss you!
"i dont know what this feeling is so maybe someone could help me       i feel like crying because i miss them so much, i would do anything for them in a heartbeat, they make me smile when no one else can, and jzt by saying hi all the clouds go away        help!"
so i finally  found the word i have been looking for and it scares me!
i wish the entire world would stand still so i could spend one more second with you   and i looked over knowing u were thinking the same thing     
"?? i am no <propmale>, i am no saint, i am not anyones wildest dream, but i will stand behind and be someone to fall back on  ill be the one who waits, and for as long as youll let me, i will be the one you need  ??"
"unified diversity, functioning as one body, every part encouraged by the other   no one independent of another, you're irreplaceable, indispensable, you're incredible!"
just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with everything they have
you are beautiful and special like sun and rain at the same time    
omg! as of 11:29am beta psi <propfemale> is offically an organization on the uw green bay campus!!!!! i am so happy!!!!
my heart is finally free from all the negativity   and now i can breath
"i won't justify the way i live my life 'cause i'm the one livin' it feelin' it, tastin' it and you're just wasting your time trying to throw me a line when you're the one drowning    i like where i'm at on my back floating down in my own riptide    the water is fine"
if anyone is trying to contact me im sorry to say my phone has deceased and i will be taking it to the mortician 2morow     very sad moment

dont forget to send me ur #s either txt or inbox   same #
i go against the odds and maybe thats wrong but i like where i'm going   
is this the way nice girls should play? i gotta say i don't care    what will it take to make you understand that i won't break and i don't give a damn   it's over you told me and you don't wanna know me   alone now   i know that you're never gonna get me down!
newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take you away    climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone    
you only see what i want you to and nothing else   i am in control   and if you're lucky   just maybe     you will get to see my heart   
i wait here in the silence until you come and sit awhile with me      there is no life without its hunger and each restless heart beats so imperfectly     but when you come i can glimpse eternity    
open your eyes with me    see paradise with me   awake and rise with me   i am the dawn   i'm the new day begun   
omg the bend and snap!     works eveytime!
"someday life will be fairer, need will be rarer, and greed will not pay    'til then, on days when the sun is gone, we'll <propfemale> on as we wish upon the <propfemale>   "
oh what tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive    
goin to test my asthmas breaking point    hope it doesnt get the best of me
my great grandma has helped me through another god awful night      thank you so much     missing you everyday    
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned    and one that knows martial arts is much worse!
"slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster, once i start its very hard to stop  faster, faster, it is so exciting   1,2,3,4,12341234     "
let the rain fall down and wake my dreams    let it wash away my sanity
the veil you had over my eyes has been blown away and now i see you for who you really are    and i dont like it    
happy birthday to my little brother <propfirst>! love you so much       hope you have an amazing day! party!

must try to hold on and keep my head above the water     but right now i just wanna let go    servo a periculum
"all you have to do is call my name no matter how close or far away   ask me once and  i'll come runnin   keep me in your heart and i'll appear   all you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside    i'm right here"

this is the world we live in   and these are the hands we're given   use them and let's start trying to make it a place worth living in   a place worth fighting for   
some times in our lives we all have pain   we all have sorrow   but if we are wise we know that theres always 2morrow   
im done    im fucking done    i give up    fuck everything    fuck this fucked up life    im just done    
can't you see that you're smothering me? holding too tightly afraid to lose control    cause everything that you thought i would be has fallen apart right in front of you    every step that i take is another mistake to you

"you'll wake up when i walk outâ€¦isn't that the way it plays? the leaver leaves, the stayer staysâ€¦you wouldn't make a move, so i made mineâ€¦ isn't it a pity?    i wish you were really in it for lifeâ€¦"

there are always the people in your life that are going to tell you that what you have is not good enough or that your stupid for trying    only keep the people in your life that encourage you to try   the rest can be forgotten   life is about discovery and making mistakes   so lets make them    
"the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in returned   "

forget about your worries and your strife   the bare necessities of life will come to you   
c'mon drift away through fundamental boundaries   to find ourselves surrounding the ones who've already gone and come back stronger  
"i love my sister week: if you have a sister who has made you laugh, wiped your tears, hugged you, watched you succeed, saw you stumble, cheered you on, kept you strong, prays for your happiness   then copy and paste this to your status     where all my sisters at???"

life is too short to worry   take advantage of all the opportunities in your life and look out for those signs that present themselves   they might just be the things that change your life   
"there are some days, dark and bitter  seems we haven't got a prayer   but a prayer for something better is the one thing we all share   someday our fight will be won, and we'll stand in the sun   one day, someday    soon"
"you dont believe me but the things i have are the things you need    you look at me like i dont make sense, like a waste of time, like it serves no purpose   "
"she loves her mama's lemonade, hates the sound that goodbyes make   she prays one day she'll find someone to need her   caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster   she just needs someone to take her home   "
turning out to be the worst day ever    why me?
im jzt a granade waiting to e playful lode    if anyone messes with me today   watch out!
never ask what worse things could happen    i just found out   
everything in the world must have balance    today was jzt one of those days   we can't live in yin without the <propfemale>    
had an amazing day yesterday! and all on a school night   lol
here it is   the last day of my life and i'm jumping in    one step into space and i'm falling in    and i ain't gotta parachute   
"my feet are on the ground, but im flying   i dont know where im going but i know its going fast    loves the only thing thats keeping us alive   this is my revelation   "
oh what tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive    fooling no one but yourself    hell has to notice your actions and motives    
likes it on the chair!
and i dont know where im going but i know its going fast   loves the only thing thats keeping us alive  this is my revelation  
we are all miracles wrapped up in chemicals   we are incredible   donâ€™t take it for granted    
"you alone can break my fall    i'm living again, awake and alive i'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies    "
is floating on a cloud!  laugh 
live and let live   hang on for the ride of your life its gonna be alright   just hold on tight   
i try to pay attention and the words just disappear    so i speak to you in riddles cuz my words get in my way forgetting all the things i should have said   
when i'm kissing you my senses come alive   almost like the puzzle piece i've been trying to find   falling right into place   
i am not the person to quit anything but if things keep going the way they are i might just have to get up and walk away from a beautiful idea    
"these fickle, fuddled words confuse me   look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster   the space between where you're smilin' high is where you'll find me   "
life is a song   love is music   all we have to do is listen   
"open your eyes   open up wide   i'm starting to trip, i'm losing my grip and i'm in this thing alone    "
you know i always stay up without sleeping   there's nothin' else better to do anyway when you're all alone in the lands of forever under the milky way   
having a deep connection with the earth   with animals   and with spirits is one of the most powerful and amazing feelings in this world   
this is war!   lets do this!
"when the world is full of pain and all that's left is love and hate give me love, let me feel it   "
i just dont know   im so very confused   lost in a beautiful idea   
screw the store pumpkins   me and my family march through the rain and mud to find the perfect ones!
this situation is turning out like every other one i have been through   i thought you said it would be different   you lied!
when lies become the truth   when things start to come undone   thats when i run to you   
25% of all men are unstable   25% of all men can't be faithful  30% of them don't mean what they say   and 10% of the remainin' 20 is gay   i hate statistics!
"whatever it takes to be what i was meant to be, i'm going to try cause i'm living the dream and i know it   i know it  and i know everything will be fine with me, myself and time   "
"put this as your status if you or someone you love has been eaten by a velociraptor  it's time to let silent victims everywhere know that there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for vicious sport  velociraptors are, after all, unstoppable "
"they say the beat of a butterflies wings, can set off a storm a world away   so come with me and seize the day   this world may never be the same   "
dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before    
"going to spend an amazing night with some awesome people! (cough) <propfemale> joy, sarabeth johnston, <propfirst> yehle, <propfemale> vogel, and cooper lafond!"
"hold fast to your dreams, for without them life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly    "
"i'm always, always, always late   and my hair's a mess, even when it's straight   but so what, i'm better off everyday in every way   so take that!"
to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment    
"remember remember the fifth of november   gunpowder, treason and plot   i see no reason why gunpowder, treason should ever be forgot   "
ive had an epiphany    now i must listen to it   
i've cleared you out of my head and tore you out of my heart   and now my life is so much better   
i am <propfemale> tempted to pick up the phone and send you a txt   not because i miss you   jzt so i can ask you one question   
"friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed    but i believe in it with every fiber of my being    "
"first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win    "
