is reading eclipse from the twilight series and i think the two main characters are douche bags!!!
thinks <propfirst> and <propfemale> are douche bags who try not to be douche bags but end up doing douche bag things which makes them even more douchier than what they already are 
"is reading book 4 of the twilight series  so far it's pretty good  obviously, i love <propmale>'s p o v  the best but why are his chapter titles so long???"
"has finished \breaking dawn\""!!!"""
thinks if i would've just read pt  3 of breaking <propfemale> that i wouldn't have had to read all that bella edward jacob nonsense  some say it's about the journey vs the destination but pt  3 of book 4 really does sum everything up w out anyone having to waste
