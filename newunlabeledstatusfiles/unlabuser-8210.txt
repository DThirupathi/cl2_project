i won a trip to iceland  awesome night 
stuck in connecticut for the weekend because my car crapped out and won't be fixed until next week 
getting all my ducks in a row for the move next week 
my last day at work today  then intense packing  then intense driving 
"eating the yummiest cookies made from local cookie dough  chocolate chip, oatmeal, granola, butterscotch chip, walnuts and coconut "
iowa has really bad pizza 
just dropped <propfirst> off at the airport  on my own until september 
"next time anyone orders dominos    order online  they have a tracking thing that lets you know exactly at what point your meal is, while its being prepped, baked, boxed and shipped  okay i am way to fascinated with the tracker thingy "
first day of orientation over  went pretty well i think  tired though 
first day of classes 
<propfirst> comes back tomorrow night!
missing my loves at home  a lot    all of a sudden 
i really wanted to skip class and sleep     but then i realized how much i am paying for this 
"i think i need to go buy some vit d supplements  i think everyone needs to go take a whole bunch of vit d     unless you are one of my sun-baking freak friends  and then at least this is one thing you do not have to worry about  you may have no skin in the future but you will have a lower <propmale> of breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia "
focusing after seven hours straight of lectures is giving me the shakes 
"i think it is interesting and rather e playful ected that the further class progresses, the larger percentage of my classmates are on facebook "
ready for this week to be over 
homemade dress a fail  possibly could be recovered    but not by tomorrow  shopping bright and early tomorrow 
"so i was violently ill yesterday  so no plane, no wedding    boo "
my brain feels like mush
still homesick 
discussion of frantically masturbating monkeys by professor  check 
why is it that no one on cash cab knows any basic science questions? jeez 
"there was about a cup of litter left in the <propfemale> litter bucket, and crow decided to forgo the box and go directly to the source  i really wish i had seen it "
thanks everyone for all the birthday wishes  25 is grown up isnt it? scary 
what a serendipitous night 
just played my new wii fit 
had a crazy new years in boston  saw two near <propmale> award recipients  now off to new hampshire for skiing  relaxing funness 
back in iowa  it is beyond ridiculously cold 
has no voice
"\ride out the wave\"""""
is full of show tunes
"question i never knew i needed to know the answer to  \why is poop brown\""  well now i know and knowing if half the battle """
"at foal icu until 7 smile 0am  i somehow thought last night, that setting my alarm for 2:45a would give me 45 <propfemale> to get dressed and get over here by 3a  i got here by 3a   "
the little rental car did not appreciate the surprise snow  at a hotel in <propfirst> mo 
5 weeks and i am done 
i was really hoping that i wasn't going to be called into foal icu at 3am tonight     oh well 
"\attack of the desmosomes\"" next on the dermatology horror fest"""
i cannot find my car key 
just over 2 weeks left 
"as of today, there is a new privacy setting called \instant personalization\"" that shares data with non-facebook websites and it is automatically set to \""allow \"" go to account > privacy settings > applications and websites > instant personalization and uncheck \""allow\""  please copy & repost """

"i was really hoping when i woke up this morning that today was daylight savings time    but no, have to wait another week to sleep for an extra hour "
got my ticket to go to <propfemale> from december 26- <propfirst> 8 
"my parasite notes actually contain the phrase \all cases of <propfemale> are fatal\"""""
"i just had a 15 minute conversation with a student from umass who was soliciting donations and alumni goodwill  i informed him that he needed to take advantage of his undergrad years because life will never again be so carefree and lovely  ever \\really having trouble studying "
thinking about getting a lab puppy

"why not annoyed change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon character from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same  until monday (december 6), there should be no human faces on facebook, but an invasion of memories  this is a campaign to stop violence against children"
