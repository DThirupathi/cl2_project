thank god this was the lastweek of going to school 5 days a week 9-3 and then working all weekend 9-3  been doing that shit since feburary
hmmm save my paycheck or spend it on the bike? toughy 
"fart machine, jorts, squirt guns, scooter, bicycles, silly string, and skate boards make for the best last day of school ever!"
the only way this night would be better is if i was next to you
no one even heard about it! damn it!
bored  need something to do   
"debt day is june 1st, right?"

it's hard to believe how far i've come on the bike  i think i can say i'm about half way done
holy shit    other than debt day this will be my last time setting foot in sahs   
2nd period exam started at 9:15 and i finished at 9 smile 7   
i hope i get to see you over summer   
so     what to do tomorrow?
i've waited over ten years and i can't stand the waiting anymore    i'm so ready to ride
i have no idea what to do tomorrow
so i just found a $50 check from my grandma for graduation  for some reason i don't feel like i should take the money
"i'm so tired of being told i can't, i'm not able, and i shouldn't when every fiber of my brain is telling me i can, i am able, and i should!"
"so myspace won't let me be friends with this girl i work with because of \age restrictions\"" what the hell? is myspace calling me a pedofile?"""
"you're so close, yet you're so far away   "
wrecked my mom cars tonight    anyone willing to help me get to and from work for a while? i'll probably need a ride to debt day and grad rehersals
"god my moms car is so fucked    there's this huge piece of metal that all the suspension, the engine, and tranny all bolts to it and just about every weld holding it together broke  it's surprising it didn't get ripped out from underneath it    i think once again i have to give up on the whole motorcycle dream   "
i need to get out of this place
so once again it has been proven to me that nice guys truly do finish last
couldn't i have just drove off a bridge or something instead?
has anyone been thru the k-mart parking lot lately?
"could of, should of, would of   "
why couldn't it of been my car?
"say what ya want, but i wish i just had someone to cuddle with"
so    who wants to give me a ride to debt day?
"i never knew this before, but air bags smell really bad   "
what's up with all these people i barely even know wanting to be my friends?
so when are we suppose to be at school for debt day tomorrow? can we just show up whenever?
"geez, i'm just letting everyone down   "
"i can't get the sight of that curb, the feeling of hitting that curb, and the smell of that damn airbag out of my head"
"why the hell not?\\if you \like\"" this staus i will post \",fb3fad8258292e5fe1c459e26923fad8,my dog is such a fatty    she's begging for pizza again!

"this entertained me for a bit so i'm posting it again\\if you \like\"" this staus i will post \",fb3fad8258292e5fe1c459e26923fad8,waiting on <propmale> to get here     i hope he didn't forget me
keep finding that everything really comes down to one night that happened before i was even born   
it's cold in here    wish there was somone to keep me warm
"\dedicated to! how i'm fucking you!\"" - master of puppets"""
so    getting to work today is gonna be fun!
i wonder if anyone is downtown    text or call 5402599
"had a fun day  rode around downtown, got some stuff for the bike, made some money    good day"
"alright, things are getting better  how can i tell? the bike is consuming my thoughts again and i'm getting excited about it!"
just found a letter from some lawyer about the citation i got over <propmale>'s jeep  all it said was i should go to court over all this  my boss said i should too if i know it wasn't my fault    maybe i should?
chillin at jeffs  this place is awesome!
"you make me smile, please stay for a while"
i think i just got locked in the freezer at ihop   
"gonna go <propfemale> with <propmale> before graduation    to think that 14 years ago when i first went to pre-k and met <propmale> i was thinking \i'm never getting out of this place   \"""""
so some chick that <propmale> likes just flashed me    not sure what i should do
time to party   
i have no idea whats going on    i kissed her infront of <propmale>  i feel like such a <propmale> but i still want to again    this is why i consider myself an asshole

takin a break from the bike and damn i'm filthy!
attempting to lay down some masking tape on the tank for the two tone paint job    this is a gonna be a little bit harder than i originally thought

"yeah, its dead at ihop could really use some customers"
i think it's time this bird flew the coop
it's a great feeling to be waking up at 12 surprise 0!
hmmm  sitting at home with nothing to do and my ride is rolling again    what to do?
"so my consisted of fixing my jeep, painting the bike, and getting slapped downtown     good day i say!"

well got a bit done on the bike tonight  tomorrow i'm gonna go shopping for more parts
"uhhhg  i doubt anyone on here is an e playful ert when it comes to titles and registration, right?"

"i have no interest in skating, but for some reason i really dig the movie \the lords of dogtown\"""""
"waiting, waiting, waiting"

i was gonna go to bed at a decent hour     what was i thinking?
"<propmale>, you need to go to bed    i don't wanna! go to bed! no! now mister!    you never let me have any fun"
so i was at <propfirst>'s and i felt the need to get up and start bussing their tables because their bus boys were so slow  i saw where they rol their silverware and felt compelled to roll  i'm always checking to make sure plates are clean no matter where i'm at  i keep  haveing dreams about ihop and it just feels plain wierd if i don't go to ihop once a day     i think this maybe a sign i work wayyyy too much
so i just flipped sammi
haha death! haven't got me yet you little bitch!
"death    you've been after me since the day i was born, but you ain't getting my ass, fuck you"
"so that <propfirst> ass didnt just fuck up sammi, i got pretty beat up too  just now started to really feel it"
