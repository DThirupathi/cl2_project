jerking is pointless  it'd be easier if bboying took over the world and made hiphop rule again  > smile  and i'm e playful ecting it to happen: it's just a matter of teaching the ignorant

dreaming of rain
"dreaming, just dreaming of light and crystals    the sound of breezes upon the waves, the rippling of still waters, and the sound of waves upon the still shores   "
tired beyond physical tiredness    mentally tired and worn out as well

stupid parents and their internet addiction  6+ hours on the computer internet addiction  6+ hours streaming korean dramas on the computer internet addiction  6+ hours streaming korean dramas that kill my internet internet addiction
listening to hours and hours of lectures and taking notes  laugh  i love it~
looking for specific books in my home is literally like trying to find a needle in a haystack
"i'm tired of the shadows  being in the dark is isolating and forbidding  knowing otherwise is the only way to survive and clearly live  i must be brought to light and bring to light what i do not understand  but how shall i attain, discover, such a position? we shall see in the times to come "
i'm tired of the way things are going  i feel like i'm only fighting an uphill war
"people, as a favor to me~ go through my most recent 2 notes and tell me what you think? good or bad, just as a favor- i find them interesting, and i want to know what you guys think"
"i feel like there's a wall between me and the people i want to talk to  the sad part is, they're not my walls  i'm being kept out "
i hate my life -_-
"first, do no harm "
sat's tomorrow    wish me luck!
"why on earth do grades even exist? education is for \pursuit of knowledge\"" since when did it become \""pit people against each other and see who survives through it?\"" there is a contradictory belief that exists there"""
how do i make a choice between different parts of self?
i need more books  more literature  more time on my hands to read
"caught mid-range between my two traditions, where one attitude often clashed with the other and one technique of playing was by the other opposed, i caused whole blocks of people to suffer \\-<propmale> ellison, living with music"
why is the southern california library branch connection's book collection so pathetic? it doesn't have more than enough books to satisfy my <propfemale> for more books to devour   
"everything happens for a reason  no matter what it is, when it is- everything, every single thing happens for a reason "
\there goes my pain\,2ca9383f3ec43c02fada1dcdec98bec5,analyzing english lit isn't that bad  surprise  it's more fun than i gave it credit for
"the more i <propmale> after something, the further away it gets from me   "
"i am the one who says over and over, \i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry\"" in a litany that almost never ends    when will that stop?"""
programming my calc is actually not that bad o___o
cavities d:
"don't disregard the weight of words  no matter how lighthearted they seem, there is thought behind them "
we all wonder what's wrong  with ourselves; with what we're doing; with other people; with life; with the universe  and time slows to a stop  we want to get it moving again  but how? and why? because the only life worth living is one lived 
i shut the door and closed the shutters  the only light that springs forth now is the sole candleflame from the attic    
"honestly, i would be proud to call myself quasimodo  odd name, indeed, but as with anything else, there's more to life than what meets the eye "
time to power-review  power-study? maybe a little bit of both -_-

donating blood is very tiring o__o
"the ability to compartmentalize    and the fact that i'm doing so now   \is that really healthy?"
dropping ib makes me feel relaxed and happy
"everyone has to say goodbye sometime  some don't mind the loss  some can't accept it  some try to deny it  as time passes, no one can go by without e playful eriencing it  we run to hold on while we can  eventually, we let go  because we're lost  because we can't go on  because we get pushed aside  the fact still remains- we all part ways  the only question is: how do i let go, knowing that those people are so dear to me?"
is it abnormal for me to be able to relate to holden from catcher in the rye? because that's how i feel  just like holden 
"something's wrong when i'm afraid to say hi to people \but i am\i can only wonder why"
"all the time i have left\is flooding away \where did it all go?\flying away on wings"
"<propfemale> dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis \<propfemale> dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis \<propfemale> dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, <propfemale> nobis pacem  \dominus deus exaudi nos et miserere exaudi, dominus\<propfemale> nobis pacem et salva nos a hostibus \salva nos, deus\sanctus, <propfemale>, kyrie, fons bonitatis \kyrie, ignis divine, eleison "
