"<propfirst> started school today, it's a little weird to have him gone in the morning, luckily this morning i'm feeling okay, tired and a slight stomache ache, but coherent and able to be a mom "
heavenly father certainly helps us when we need it  i have had more energy and been able to take better care of my child and home today than i have for more than a month  i guess he knew i needed the extra help today with <propfirst> at school 
"<propfemale> is napping, and i have a massive headache  i should be sleeping right now, but i can't get my mind to shut off"
went to bed an hour an a half ago  got up five minutes later because an arrangement in my head was screaming at me to be let out

"is really sad because she has looked everywhere she can think of to find the battery charger for her camera, i wanted to do better about pictures of me pregnant this baby, but i don't think i can afford a new charger and the old one hasn't been seen since we moved   maybe its just the pregnancy hormones, but it really makes me want to cry "
does anyone in the cedar city area have a battery charger for a nikon coolpix s220 i can borrow my charger has been missing since we changed apartments in june and i really wanted to put some preggo pictures in the next baby book i make
"trying to teach <propfemale> to say thank you i say \say thank you\"" her reply?\",a8769b5f9568b9e30e028b87db0b9ff6,hates saturday nights

"i think <propfemale> may be ready for a toddler bed  i asked her \do you want a nap?\""  and she walked to her crib and waited for me to put her in then took her binky and lay down """

the relief society broadcast was soooooooooo good 
doers it seem smoky today to anyone else in cedar?
sick again!! aaagh!!!
why are the days that i am sick and tired the ones that <propfemale> refuses to nap or behave like her normal sweet self?
"so today physical therapy made things feel a little worse, but i suppose that could be just because i am tired from being up all night coughing   "
"i do not seem to be getting better, and i'm not sure what to do, now in addition to the headache, sinus pressure, and chest congestion i can add vomiting and intense ear pain to the list, i went to the instacare clinic and the guy gave me stuff for what he said was wrong with me, but if this isn't better soon i may wind up going to the er for a  second oppinion    sad "
is grateful that conference will be in the ensign and on the internet for later perusal   my ear is so stuffy and swollen i cannot hear much  sad 
"couldn't finish therapy today, the pressure in my ear and head was too painful  "
"soooooo sick   i am under my midwife's instructions to rest, drink lots of fluids and sit by my humidifier 24 7"

"the most romantic date ever    our elder's quorum president chauffeuring us in the romantic glow of the hazard lights, as we are being towed home     sniff sniff"
i don't know what to do i just woke up realizing that without a car i may not be able to get to an important appointment this morning that i have been to sick to go to for several weeks    anyone willing to give me a ride to a studio around 10?
"feeling the effects of all the drinking i did last night (no it's not what you think jk)    i drank five 16 oz water-bottles between 8 and 10 last night, every time i finished one <propfemale> would hand me another and i just drank it, i needed the water, but my pregnant bladder could only take so much  i had to get up four or five times in the middle of the night to use the bathroom  the effects this morning? exhaustion"
i might just be getting past this rough patch  i had enough energy to clean my livingroom and my bathroom today  and i'm still feeling pretty good    i just might finish my checklist today that would feel really really good 
baby poll: boy or girl? what do you think?
nothing like an appendectomy to ruin your weekend plans   
"feeling better today  my incisions are still really sore, but i made it around the block today, and gave <propfemale> a bath "
feeling a little baheebie geebied tonight    got stuff going through my head i really would rather not think about
"so we missed the <propmale> halloween party because i had surgery, but i don't know of anything else to take <propfemale> to in her costume  even if i did know of something she's been coughing a lot at night so i don't know that i would want to take her outside for trunk or treating or trick or treating, anyway, maybe we'll just have to have a little family party on sunday night when <propfirst> is off i got hocus pocus   "
so it's not even three o'clock on the day before halloween and we just had our first trick-o-treaters lol 
i'm thankful that my baby is healthy and that <propfemale> is turning into a big talker 
"i can grow people, what's your superpower?"
"chris:that's what you get for thinking woman\<propfemale>: <propfirst> you are positively prime-evil\chris: why thank you <propfemale>, what say you to getting on <propfemale> craft and looking at my achievements\<propfemale>:maybe some other time\sound familiar? anybody? like that one disney movie right?"
"massive headache, tylenol is not cutting it  oh how i wish there was something else to take while your pregnant"
"i still don't understand daylight savings, but i think i get an extra hour before church tomorrow maybe we will make it on time to choir practice  lol"
"suddenly felt so sick that i lay down on the living room floor  i dozed off  when i woke up i found that <propfemale> had put on a movie, covered me with a blanket and answered her daddy on the phone    what a smart kid\now i am off to bed, but i just had to share"
it's a girl!!!!!!!
so we found out that the baby is a girl and <propfemale> said she loved me for the first time today     can a mother get any luckier?
has to brag about her amazing wonderful husband who surprised me by staying up after his shift ended at 1am to finish doing the dishes  i love you sweetie!!!
"woke up starving this morning, thank goodness for the leftover pizza i made last night "
"just found out that <propfirst> will probably have to work during a good chunk of the day and into the night on thanksgiving, i hate being so far away from family, if i was closer at least i wouldn't have to be alone on the holiday  sad  (sigh)"
"i had to pull <propfirst> out of class today  some guy had followed me from one store to another, and then he was following me around cedar in a car  by the time i got hold of <propfirst> and went to pick him up i had shaken the guy, but still i was a wreck "
"so i've been hearing a lot about these body scanner things, not sure how i feel about it  i've never been on a plane though, has any else had to deal with them? and if so was it as big a deal as they are making it?"
"i am so ready to go to bed, i'm tired enough    i should go to bed    okay  up    not working   "
"so the weird prego dreams i don't mind so much, but last night i kept waking up from very vivid nightmares    (shudder)"
just made the most beautiful gluten-free pumpkin pie ever     just hope it tastes as good as it looks
"although i'm sad that i've seen the last of my sweetie for the night, i'm grateful for the time i got to spend with him today "
i am sooooooooooo sick again  the baby really doesn't like all this coughing 
"is there anyone in the cedar city area who would be willing to watch <propfemale> on friday night  i have a concert in st  <propfirst> for my woman's choir, and <propfirst> has to work "
"so i'm all for the end of child abuse, but i don't see what changing my profile picture to a cartoon does to help that  i'd rather have the picture i have of me and my daughter smiling together "
<propfemale> is two today!!!!
i finished my cd wooohhooooo!!!
"so we just got a 200$ <propmale> from my surgery, granted that is a lot less than the surgery actually cost but i don't have an extra 200$ right now  besides i thought i was going to get full coverage from medicaid   "
i think saturdays are currently the bane of my existence   
my ipod touch has a crack in it sad  it's not super noticeable but it is concerning since i can't afford to replace it
"thank goodness for kind people, and mistakes that are easily fixed"

"<propfemale> is so tired i put her to bed without a bath, and without dinner (couldn't get her to eat anything) i just hope that she stays asleep for the night and doesn't wake up at  3am or something "
"heard the garbage truck coming up the street and looked out the door to realize that with school starting this morning my sweet husband forgot to put the can on the street, so i slipped on the first shoes i could ind and then went running out in the snow without a coat to lug the heavy can to the street  now i'm wheezing a little and i can't seem to stop  man i miss arizona at moments like this "
