"nothing like having some random person add you on skype, then they don't tell you who the hell they are "
"que sera sera, what happens happens   "
today is the best day of the week  for one it is friday and two it is payday  when they combine nothing can bring me down   smile 
isn't it fun when brain and mouth don't connect?
sometimes sleep doesn't do a body good   
"if you're brave  copy this status & see what people pick for you!\(1) crazy\(2) wish we went out\(3) talkative\(4) sarcastic\(5) lovable\(6) sexy\(7) strong\( smile  dumb\(9) dumb\(10) mouthy\(11) wild\(12) goofy\(13) awesomely awesome\(14) kiss \(15) beautiful\(16) weird\(17) love you\(1 smile  random\(19) best friend\(20) amazing  wink "

feeling like meh 
migraine making me feel like total crap  nauseated to the stomach  sipping peppermint tea hoping that it helps me 
"i see it on the horizon, i smell it in the air, it is almost here it's the weekend! and boy do i need it  two days to sleep in and try not to feel miserable "
"f my brain   family is watching \just desserts\"" and someone said \""whoopee pie\"" and i swear they said \""wookie pie\""   """
is it sad that sometimes i feel more of a man than a man? y'all might know who i am talking about  i've grown as a person in the past few months and i don't need people acting like children in my life 
took <propfemale>'s advice and now i feel like a human  hooray!
i got a feeling that a visit to the doctor might be in order on monday  not too excited but it has to be done 
got an idea on how to rearrange the house  laugh 
learned something awesome today thanks to terry   i am a damn good shot  laugh 
"dining room chair\sometimes the floor"
"aaaaahhhhh shooooooo ?    ifyou're allergic to bullshit, drama queens, head games, liars, two faced fake people, keep this sneeze going      i can't wait to see who reposts!!!"
ok this damn rain needs to stop  it makes me feel miserable and want to sleep all the time  plus i need to gather up the tomatoes that remain in the garden  and kidnap my aloe <propfemale> babies haha 
nothing like a flat tire to start off this beautiful day   
"a 13yr old boy in texas shot himself in the head after years of bullying for supposedly being gay  <propmale> walsh 13, <propmale> himself from a tree after relentless bullying for being gay <propfirst> clementi 18, a freshman at rutgers, jumped off the gw bridge after his roommate broadcasted a video of <propfirst> w  another guy  today, i stand up to those bullies in their honor  if you care to stand up with me, repost this as your status"
sneezing can be detrimental to your health    
ok why the hell the im on here isn't working?

finally figured out the issue with my computer monitor  i am looking into buying a new graphics card so it can take some of the strain off of the monitor  then maybe   just maybe it will stop freaking out on me 
ergh not feeling good
"put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice-people who are gay are not looking for a cure but, acceptance andequalrights    93% won't copy and paste this  will you   make it your status for at least one hour? promote love & acceptance! not hate!"
ok who invited a truck to run my ass over today? feeling like crap 
feels like curling into fetal position but i gotta do what i gotta do 
"stop!lookto your right whatever object you see there is your designated weapon in the upcoming zombie apocalypse! comment on this post to tell me what it is, then repost to spread the zombie virus "

"finally friday, now if i could only kick this nagging cough   "
has started to knit again  making a hat right now  at least it takes my mind off of this constant cough 
"interesting how certain things can make you think of people  it can be a smell, it can be a taste or a sound  feeling a little sentimental tonight "
"i am glad that i got the friends i do at work  let's just say someone just cannot keep my name out of their mouth  hate me, call me a bitch but get one thing right <propfemale> i am hbic  not my fault you are bitter and that i've moved on "

possibly heading out to phantom fright nights tonight with a couple of my buddies  can't wait to get the last roller-coaster ride of the season in 
well kennywood is out of the question now  one of the people i was going with ended up staying at work till late 
looked in my wallet to see if i could return today and get a friday or saturday instead  sadly there is no receipt to be found 
"i found my guardian angel  he is sitting in the corner with a cigarette dangling from his lips and watching the smoke rise to the air  caring less and less every day about trivial matters  i try to get his attention, motioning and beckoning him over yet he brushes me away like an errant child "
this new font on facebook is highly annoying and a little hard on the eyes 
finally tomorrow is friday and saturday is my bro's birthday  he already knows what he is getting from me for his b-day 
"1 go to google maps  2  go to directions 3  type japan as the start location  4  type <propfemale> as the end location  5  go todirection #43  6  laugh, and repost "
my dog acts like a child i swear  pay attention to someone or something else for a moment and she sulks
saw toy story 3 today   disney and pixar did a good job of making me miss my childhood toys 
tomorrow is the best day of the month    payday
knows that tomorrow will be spent cleaning seeing as i got home with only an hr to spare then back to the yellow box that nobody can see 
thank you to all the veterans out there 
am i the only one who is getting sick and tired of hearing about poor defenseless dogs and cats being left in abandoned houses as the owners make up miserable excuses as to why they could not take care of said pets? one excuse was from a cop (who should know better) saying that the dogs were his wives   
wow got some wild winds here today
has found out that 200 is the <propmale> allowed for a youtube playlist
thanks a ton <propfirst> for coming over  tv works wonderful and the living room looks great   smile

"going shopping around christmas time is the bane of my existence  i absolutely hate doing it  it's not all the christmas music, just the sheer fact that people about run you over when they are shopping "

"let me get this straight: <propfirst> <propmale> is getting his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for a 9th time, <propfemale> spears had a 55-hour marriage, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods are screwing everything, yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage? really?! \feel free to repost to your <propfemale> if you agree  proud to support equal rights for all!"
had enough of this frozen wasteland which is outdoors  just because my ancestors came from where it was cold does not mean i enjoy it 
everyone in my house is sick with the exception of me for now  i don't want to get a cold especially with christmas right around the corner 
feeling adventurous in my cooking foray  going to make some fudge with pieces of fireballs in it will let everyone knows how it turns out once i make it  and whoot for christmas break 
well today started off with a bang *literally*
well time to get my bake and cook on  have safe travels tonight for those who are going out 
<propfemale> christmas!

cell phone dead   fml

ok some asshole needs to stop spreading hate on my bro or else i'd bring some hate to them  don't tread on my family 
"every time i hear a kamelot song, the more i love <propfirst> khan "
back to the daily grind going back to work was made easier thanks to my friends  smile 
hip hurting feeling like dr  house
there are very few human comforts that make me happy but having a good cup of tea and having <propfirst> khan sing is two of my favorite things  oh yeah and today being friday makes it three  smile 
"[poke] me if you've ever had a crush on me or still do   smile \[like] this status if you think i'm a good friend   smile \[message] me if you ever wanted a relationship with me   smile \[comment] on this if we have had good memories   smile \[copy & paste to your status] if you're brave  smile "
nothing like going outside in your pjs with a dog in the snow 
"i'm not superstitious, but this year july has 5 fridays, 5 saturdays and 5 sundays  this happens once every 823 years  this is called money bags  so copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days  based on chinese feng shui  the one who does not copy,    will be without money"
guess i have to make some phone calls tomorrow to get something settled  hate when things get complicated 
"whiteness blinding everywhere\going by without care\dark of night embraces all"

found some interesting music on youtube  techno of all things and i am laughing because it is so funny yet serious at the same time   
wrestled my neighbor's trashcans then grabbed mine and slid all the way down to my house  oh what joy  no idea what the wind speed is but if i wanted to fly i could just stick my arms out and flap lol 
<propfemale> is sick going to take her to the vet after work  i feel bad because there is no way for me to help her out poor thing is snotty 
come on steelers bring 7 home!
my cat loves our toilet  she sits in front of it yowling  ><
happy <propfirst>'s day everyone
feeling like i am on cloud 9!
got to love when a cat has catnip and attacks the dog
first off who ordered snow and two i swear i might have saw a dog sled team on my way home tonight   
"cat is doing a whole lot better, she's gained a pound and a 1 2 and is now very active "
remember you do not own the cat   the cat owns you
<propfemale>   
got some songs stuck in my head  happy that the sun is finally out for once  can't wait till it warms up and i can finally enjoy the outdoors again 
today someone asked me if i was going to wear all green on st  <propfirst>'s day  now don't get me wrong i like green yet the idea of wearing green from head to toe does not appeal to me 
was just getting use to seeing the ground again but apparently nature had other ideas 
the girl you just called fat? she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs  the boy you just called stupid? he has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night  the girl you just called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her  the boy you just tripped? he is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  put this as your status if you're against bullying
finally installed a tension <propmale> in the shower  would have been easier if the cat was not trying to imitate me 
"omg! i just realized    we sit and stare at a screen, we have imaginary farms, cities and fake animals  we poke people and its ok  omg we even write on walls  think about it   facebook is a mental hospital   and we are all patients \no wonder we are all so happy here!\feel free to steal  i did! lol"
i just love the rain and watching my hair poof out 
"put this dog on\   ^ ^\\\\ your status\( (_â€¢_)\\) to show\ _ ''*''\\_ that you are\(,,,)^(,,,) against animal cruelty"
tgif!! let this weekend not go as fast as the others 
got into a rare mood to work on a short story  hopefully i will be able to end this one  and does anyone know any good <propfemale> rock bands? in the mood for <propfemale> rock & roll 
strange isn't it how we can look to where we were at a year ago and see how much we've changed? how much one can grow within that time span?
might have had too much coffee this a m but then again it is never too much
"guess buying the cat toys is useless, she much rather play with bottle caps "
i did the macarena with a fireman sliding down a hill because that's how i roll
"went out to eat dinner tonight and let me tell you the service sucked horribly  the man completely ignored my table and forgot the other part of my order  and to top it all off when i went to pay the <propmale> he looked at me like i had 2 heads and said \wow you look different standing up\"" seriously dude are you that big of an idiot? smh """
