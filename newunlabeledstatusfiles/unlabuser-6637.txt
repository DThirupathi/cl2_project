when you love someone u have to be willing to give them everything and e playful ect nothing in return!!
ur the one thing i cant stand to loose    the inspiration for my smile     the warmth in my soul
i have had a totally amazing day!!!!!! im so excited and totally hyper!!!
"all those thoughts in my head, all those misconseptions, everything i thought i believed all changed the day i met you"
my mind is full of a roller coaster of thoughts      just hope everything will work out in the end
let us cast ourselves into a world of wonder and peace and find exactly who we want to be 
let us cast ourselves into a world of wonder and peace and find exactly who we want to be 
Ã¸wishes that life could go back to the days when the biggest decison was whether to jump on the trampoline or play in the dirt        life sure is a rolle
Ã¸r coaster we all just have to learn to hold on
i just want to say thank you to everyone and anyone who has ever been there for me!!!! i love you all!!!
"those who are weak, those who are thirsty come to the fountain and dip your heart into the stream of life"
totally a happy face moment  laugh  <propfemale> understands  smile 
i wonder will i ever break free from the shadows that consume me
tired of all the deception and games people play lets go back to the good old days why cant we just all be honest with people and show the respect we want and deserve
wants to crawl within herself and reclaim the essence of who she really is  wants to find the light that shines within her heart
pain strikes the heart with a disease   a disease that spreads throughout shattering all thoughts of hope all thoughts of happiness    why cant pain loose its path to me
is trying not to believe in something she knows will never happen      sigh      im so tired of this reocurring cycle of emotions
lets skip the reminising and drown ourselves in the good of the day   consume ourselves in anything that makes us smile   surround ourselves with happiness
"i wanna break the boundaries set infront of me\destroy the hatred that attempts to consume me \envoke the love that resides in me \all in hopes to become what i know i can\achieve the dreams i picture in my head"
"why is it that just one little message can destroy ur whole day \and its always from someone who could care less if they hurt you or not \\i really just need to work on seeing the hurt in people instead of their cruelness\to see the reason behind the action instead of just the action itself\\i need to learn to love with more compassion and respect without judgement\i need to become less selfish"
will someday find what she hopes for but until  then honestly im done trying
i wish people could just see whats infront of them and go after them   realise that if u think someone is amazing u might want to grab them b4 someone else does
just dance    def-an embarrassing blast of fun  laugh  thanks to the awesome donation    god def loves us all  laugh
