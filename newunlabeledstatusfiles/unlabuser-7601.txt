"to isengard!though isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone; through isengard be strong and hard,as cold as stone and bare as bone, we go,we go,we go to war,to hew the stone and break the door; for bole and bough are are burning now,the furnace roars-we go to war! to land of glood with tramp of doom,with roll of drum,we come,we come; to isengard with doom we come! with doom we come, with doom we come!"
"ere iron was found or tree was hewn, when young was mountian under <propfemale>; ere ring was made, or wrought was woe, it walked the forests long ago "
all state auditions are killing me       makes me angry
anger      is it a good thing or a bad thing? generally speaking
ahhhh!!! why do i have to play piccolo??  sad  -sigh-
is suffering from a severe pain in his right ear  conclution: the piccolo is bad for your ear's health  result: need earplugs to practice piccolo 
closed off from love i didn't need the pain once or twice was enough and it was all in vain time starts to pass before you know it you're frozen but something happened for the very first time with you my heart melts into the ground found something true and everyone's looking round thinking i'm going crazy
"it's not a silly little moment, it's not the storm before the calm  this is the deep and dying breath of this love that we've been working on  can't seem to hold you like i want to so i can feel you in my arms  nobody's gonna come and save you, we pulled too many false alarms  we're going down, and you can see it too  we're going down, and you know that we're doomed  my dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room "
"would you know my name  if i saw you in heaven  will it be the same  if i saw you in heaven  i must be strong, and <propfemale> on  cause i know i don't belong  here in heaven"
"if i could reach the stars, id pull one down for you  shine it on my heart so you could see the truth  that this love i have inside, is everthing it seems  but for now i find, its only in my dreams, that i can change the world  i would be the sunlight in your universe you would think my love was really something good  baby, if i could change the world "
don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for  you can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for  you know it's true  everything i do - i do it for you
to really love a woman  to understand her  you've got to know what deep inside  hear every thought see every dream  and give her wings when she wants to fly  and when you find yourself lying helpless in her arms  you know you really love a woman
"<propfemale> bottom blues, you made me cry  i don?t want to lose this feeling  and if i could choose a place to die it would be in your arms  do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?  do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?  i'd gladly do it because i don't want to fade away  give me one more day, please  i don?t want to fade away  in your heart i want to stay "
has the top gun anthem stuck in his head and listening to it didnt get rid of it    so he is watching the movie now
j'arrÃªterai seu<propfemale>ment de faire l'amour Ã  votre corps quand <propmale> Ã©toi<propmale> tombent du ciel et <propmale> accidents de lune dans <propfemale> so<propfemale>il

"\the phantom of the opera is here\"""""
settled in silence             amazing band  laugh 
the end of all things
"guitar recitial tomorrow, band practice sunday, and band concert monday  i cant wait!!! music, here i come!!!"
beethoven's 5th keeps playing in my head without a pause  ever 
hates the prospect of having to go to school tomorrow  yet has to because of the band concert  and a docters appointment  oh the joy        
music has taken over what little mind i had 
bored     first thing that comes to mind     listen to beethoven's 5th!!!! i am truely hooked    
"sadness   for no reason                  what light through yonder window breaks? it is the east, and julliet is the sun  arise fair sun and kill the envious <propfemale>, which is already sick and pale with grief                      dont ask where that came from because i dont know"
first time i've practiced all state music today whahoo! actually it doesnt seem too difficult which probably means that im missing a lot of simple things that i could do better  playful 
say hello to a world of music  where you walk on notes that cresendo and decresendo and you swim in waves of sound that make you wish you could drown and still live just to drown again and all the while there isnt a moment that is meaningless 
feel the sting of memories long gone return to torment you
i had a great idea for my song! then i forgot it     then i remembered it!!!      i remembered that it was not mine    it was spring from the four seasons by vivaldi      no wonder it sounded so good    
damn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
all alone
the end is near
"soft music   a flowing saxophone solo with a gentle piano for colour    the only light is a few scattered candles that create a warm haze in the room   you are there   just like my dreams told me you would   i reach out to pull you close to me   and just as my eyes close for the perfect kiss   i wake up i suddenly feel cold,and i pull my blankets closer around me   but it doesnt help   because youre not there "
do you know what makes a piccolo sound better? earplugs!
"yay for beethoven\s 9th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
: the loner
being a romantic is not good for your sanity

love is a many splended thing  love lifts us up where we belong  or it lets us fall into the depths of loneliness 
all you need is love- to make you happy for life or to destroy it and make it into ruins of shattered wishes 
"the greatest thing, you will ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return  the second greatest thing is to love and not be loved in return (it is also one of the harshest lessons of life)  such is the power of love "
"yes   i felt her tears flow on my forehead   on mine, mine!   they were soft   they were sweet!   they trickled under my mask   they mingled with my tears in my eyes   they flowed between my lips   i tore off my mask so as not to lose one of her tears   and she did not run away!   and she did not die!    she remained alive,weeping over me,with me  we cried together!i have tasted all the happiness the world can offer!"
la plus grande chose est juste d'aimer et Ãªtre aimÃ©e en Ã©change>
"all by myself, dont want to be all by myself, anymore   "
loneliness and music  any ideas? any (except stupid ones  laugh )
suffer in silence

"i would like to hear everyones opinion on this  if you could change one thing in the world, what would it be?"
another question for everyone  whats your fantasy? your number one fantasy?
call it a feeling   a feeling that i cant stop and i cant e playful lain  it just is and i am at its mercy 
ha  time can not kill life for life must live forever  if it didnt we would all be dead the moment life died  life never dies 
thats the shortened way to put it  the only simple way to say it  thats why the poets and the writters came up with the word love because it was to complex to fit in a story or a poem otherwise 
concert tonight  smile  and tomorrow  smile  and my solo and a quintet the day after that  smile

"i just saw you, but i miss you already  sad "
