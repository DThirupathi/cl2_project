"life is strange, i must say i like it tho"
feeling so good that it hurts my skin
why do i try? why do i fucking try?
"so lie like a waste by the side as everything just falls apart 'cause everything just fell apart for me i cracked my head and broke my i cracked my head and broke my i cracked my head and broke my heart and i don't feel the need to go on i was happier singing along the way i had things, i need to say but now it's like a swallowed tape that holds up my face from inside as everything just falls apart"
"wow i too worked security for the town hall meeting, they invited <propmale> obey, but he must have gotten lost since he didnt show up, but im sure he will find his way to the ground breaking ceremony at uw marathon tomorrow lol"
it's friday and i'm home wtf?
"bury all your secrets in my skin come away with innocence and leave me with my sins the air around me still feels like a cage and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again so if you love me let me go and run away before i know my heart is just too dark to care i can't destroy what isn't there deliver me into my fate if i?m alone i cannot hate i don?t deserve to have you ooh, my smile was taken long ago"
i have such sights to show you 
"shallow skin, i can paint with pain i <propfirst> the trails on my arms with your disdain everyday it's the same - i love, you hate but i guess i don't care any more    fix my problems with the blade while my eyes turn from blue to gray god, the worst thing happened to me today but i guess i don't care anymore   "
sometimes u have to kill part of urself to get what u want
"with this one i needed to feel you so much, i wantingly longed for your touch, but now i'm ignored and i'm feeling bored 'till something is happening  cause once i thought you were right here with me, so maybe i'll take two or three until i believe what i have seen is really happening "
the more i feel the more i die nothing to give nothing inside everything i touch i break everything i touch i break everything i touch i break i scratch and tear until it bleeds i do not want i only need i only need i only need
just finished the 1 lb burger at victory <propfirst> i think i might die now lol
"as wicked as you are, you're beautiful to me you're the darkest burning <propfemale>, you're my perfect disease"
"and i won't listen to your shame you ran away, you're all the same angels lie to keep control ooh, my love was punished long ago if you still care don't ever let me know if you still care don't ever let me know"
i hurt myself today to see if i still feel i focus on the pain the only thing that's real the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting try to kill it all away but i remember everything
y is it that anytime i put lyrics on here because i think they say what im thinking ppl anyways have to say who or what they r? if i wanted that i would say name it or something  if u want to comment on it ask me y i put it y i feel that way  mayb ask y my life is shit at the time 
wow i got a job im scared lol its been a almost a year
a darkness grows inside me in fading shades of gray  all the colors of the world are slowly sucked away  i'm sinking ever deeper to a place that's cold and black  i can't believe i've lost you and you're never coming back  these lies have torn my world apart
"they say i should be happy why, just cos i am alive is that all there is what if just being is not enough  what if i want more i have tried god knows i have tried but i cannot have anything i am stuck in this vortex a vortex of dark self-hatred and loathing  a vortex that e playful ands with each passing night nights where i feel abandoned and dead inside"
abandoned by a world that is cruel and unforgiving all i want is that someone that makes me feel alive alive and able to face the dark vortex they say i should be happy i ask how

i can't escape this hell so many times i've tried but i'm still caged inside somebody get me through this nightmare i can't control myself so what if you can see the darkest side of me? no one will ever change this animal i have become help me believe it's not the real me somebody help me tame this animal

"so gas prices r going up again  last time everyone blamed bush, who r they going to blame this time?"
all the world loves things of beauty and intrigue these 2 things i've never had one born in this old skin  i'm too sick i can't win i've lived with this damage 2 long my eyes can't behold it i cannot control this this feeling that's left in my heart i've never done no wrong  i don't deserve these bones please burn up this sin when i'm gone and i said that this is ugly to me the world is ugly to me
"i push my fingers into my eyes it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache but it's made of all the things i have to take jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it!"
"some say the end is near   some say we'll see armageddon soon   i certainly hope we will   i sure could use a vacation from this  bull-shit three ring circus sideshow of  freaks here in this, hopeless fucking, hole we call la   the only way to fix it is to flush it all away   any fucking time   any fucking day   learn to swim, i'll see you down in arizona bay "
"blood like rain come down pound on grave and ground part vampire part warrior carnivore and voyeur stare at the transmittal sing to the death rattle credulous at best your <propfemale> to believe in angels in the hearts of men pull your head out your hippie haze and give a listen shouldn't have to say it all again the universe is hostile so impersonal devour to survive, so it is so it's always been we all feed on tragedy"
"â€œwhenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends life, <propfemale>, and the pursuit of happiness it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government   â€� <propfirst> <propmale> quote"
"the darkness encircles  it pulls me it wants me  the thing that scares me  is that part of me wants  wants the darkness to take  take all that i am  to consume my soul  at times, i fight it i try to stay me  but the darkness it calls to me  it sings to me and i like the songâ€¦"
do you feel the way you hate :: do you hate the way you feel                    :: always closest to the flame :: ever closer to the blade
"so if you love me, let me go  and run away before i know  my heart is just too dark to care  i can't destroy what isn't there  deliver me into my fate - if i'm alone i cannot hate i don't deserve to have you    my smile was taken long ago   if i can change i hope i never know"
"[the bullet smile  \i've got a crush on a pretty pistol should i tell her that i feel this way? father told us to be faithful i've got a crush on a pretty pistol  should i tell her that i feel this way i've got love songs in my head that are killing us away\"" [the father smile  \""do you love your guns?\"" (yeah) \""god?\"" (yeah) \""your government?\"""""
overcome by your moving <propfemale> overcome by this holiest of altars so pure so rare to witness such an earthly goddess that i've lost my self control beyond compelled to throw this dollar down before your holiest of altars i'd sell my soul my self-esteem a dollar at a time one <propmale> one kiss one taste of you my <propfemale>
i said don't go away   turned off the lights and then you   said please don't follow me   and you cared   you kept your feelings hidden   like a psycho   burned it all down   take me with you   won't you let me go   so sick of man
"pain, without love pain, i can't get enough pain, i like it rough 'cause i'd rather feel pain than nothing at all anger and agony are better than misery trust me i've got a plan when the lights go off you will understand pain, without love pain, i can't get enough pain, i like it rough 'cause i'd rather feel pain than nothing at all"
your loaded smiles :: pretty just desserts :: wish it all for you :: so much it never hurts :: you have soul machine :: stone at me :: all your mental armor drags me down :: we can't breathe when you come around :: all your mental armor drags me down :: nothing hurts like your mouth
drink life as it comes :: straight no chaser :: drink life as it comes :: straight no chaser
as for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself as for my own concern i had as think to think as keep on thinking not so hard as for the brain to burn and at the salad bar a man he stares into the croutons hypnotized by powers of the bac-o-bits and i e playful ose myself to stimuli unfit for people outside the controls of an e playful eriment 
"sunken-eyed girl in the sandwich shop ladle my soup from the kettle pot, so swoony my self with the smolder looks parsing that gaze for the right intention sunken-eyed girl don't let me go you're the whole world and you barely know so you are the drinks i drink and keep drinking and fall down stumble all of the things i think and keep thinking and lay down tremble"
and then <propfemale> staked <propfirst> the end!
"though these wounds have seen no wars except for the scars i have ignored and this endless crutch, well it's never enough it's been the worst day since yesterday hell says hello, well it's time to i should go to pastures green, that i've yet to see hurry back to me, my wild <propfemale> it's been the worst day since yesterday"
i think i have come to the sad realization that the only reason i post on here is so more than 2 people know i'm still alive 
oh how i wish for soothing rain all i wish is to dream again my loving heart lost in the dark for hope i'd give my everything oh how i wish for soothing rain oh how i wish to dream again once and for all and all for once nemo my name forevermore
"well i remember, i remember don't worry how could i ever forget, it's the first time, the last time we ever met but i know the reason why you keep your silence up, no you don't fool me the hurt doesn't show; but the pain still grows it's no stranger to you or me and i can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord i've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord"
