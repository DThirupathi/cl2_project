"i like your lips like i like my coca cola yeahhh oh how it pops and fizzes, you like my shirt like i like it when you hold my hand, the way it fits its got me feeling lucky"
"he's a, good time, cowboy casanova leaning up against the record machine  he looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery  he's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes, and he only comes out at night, gives you feeling that you don't want to fight, you better run for your life"
and i know that we can be so amazing   and baby your love is gonna change me   and now i can see every possibility
<propfemale> christmas!!!!  smile 
"all that i'm after is a life full of laughter, as long as i'm laughing with you  and i think that all that still matters is the love and the laughter, after the life we've been through 'cause i know there's no life after you"
hello sunshine  smile 
"in my wildest dreams, you always play the hero  in my darkest hour of night, you rescue me, you save my life "
starting to pack   movies   then back to <propmale> tomorrow  smile

"life with me was a fairytale love, i was head over heels till you threw away us, and it's just too bad you already had the best days, the best days of your life"
"i'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on, learn how to face my fears  love with all of my heart, make my <propfirst>, i wanna leave somethin' here  go out on a ledge, without any net, that's what i'm gonna be about  yeah, i wanna be runnin' when the sand runs out "

i wanna be the only one for <propmale> and <propmale>   except for maybe you and you're simple smile
medically speaking you're adorable   
"in my opinion, we don't devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks "
"for a kiss to be really good, you want it to mean something  you want it to be with someone you can't get out of your head, so that when your lips finally touch you feel it everywhere  a kiss so hot and so deep you never want to come up for air  you can't cheat your first kiss  trust me, you don't want to  cause when you find that right person for a first kiss, it's everything "
it's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you    
"at the end of the day, when it comes down to it, all we really want is to be close to somebody  so this thing, where we all keep our distance and pretend not to care about each other, is usually a load of bull "
weekends don't count unless you spend them doing something completely pointless 
ughhh ksjlikjhsiduoifu! grrr   shity
time to start studying for sociology   woohoo
"yes, you can hold my hand if you want to   cause i wanna hold yours too"
"if you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown, <propfemale>, i'm still free  take a <propmale> on me, gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie  if you put me to the test, if you let me try "
"there's something to be said about a glass half full  about knowing when to say when  i think it's a floating line  a barometer of need and <propfemale>  it's entirely up to the individual  and depends on what's being poured  sometimes all we want is a taste  other times there's no such thing as enough, the glass is bottomless  and all we want, is more "
boo you <propmale> state!!! exhausted and going to bed!   can't wait to go visit <propmale> copfer at wooster!!!!  smile 
today is going fantastically! hopefully my night will be just as great!  smile 
and it takes my breath away   everytime
"but can you feel this magic in the air? it must have been the way you kissed me  fell in love when i saw you standing there, it must have been the way   today was a fairytale "
movie night!  smile 
my heart is blind but i don't care 'cause when i'm with you everything has disappeared and every time i hold you near i never wanna let you go
"no matter how much we hurt them, the people that are still with you at the end of the day - those are the ones worth keeping "
"there's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind, callin' out my name like a long lost friend  oh, i miss those days as the years go by  oh, nothing's sweeter than summertime and american <propfemale> "
watching desperate housewives and studying for child psych the rest of the night

"i learned to give love and get love unconditionally  you just have to accept people for what they are, and i learned the greatest gift of all  the saddest thing in life is wasted talent, and the choices that you make will shape your life forever "
"now you don't wanna let go and i don't wanna let you know, there might be something real between us two  who knew? now we don't wanna fall but we're tripping in our hearts  and it's reckless and clumsy cause i know you can't love me here "

in texas until saturday   loving this weather  smile 
"lookin' back at the moments, black white, i wouldn't change a thing that changed my life  for the worse, for the better, man, i was gone, gone forever "
blisters on the balls of your feet = big ouchy  sad 
do you know when to walk away? do you know when not to take less than you deserve?
"no matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dream that you wish will come true "
"there's a dream that i've been chasing   want so bad for it to be reality  and when you hold my hand, then i understand that   it's meant to be   love "
fyi: turning the light on to use the bathroom in the middle of the night may cause cancer    thanks for that little bit of info <propfemale> gertsma
"he comes on with his big, innocent farm boy routine, but i could see through that in a peloponnesian minute "
home for a little bit then bg to visit cassee collins!
"we met it seems, such a short time ago  you looked at me, needing me so  yet from your sadness, our happiness grew  then i found out, i need you, too  i remember how we used to play  i recall those rainy days, the fires glowed, that kept us warm  and now i find, we're both alone  goodbye may seem forever, farewell is like the end  but in my heart's a memory, and there you'll always be "
"just like a dream, you are not what you seem"

"somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight, someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight   love "
i'll be the wings that keep your heart in the clouds
"\why does it have to be follow the spiders? why can't it be follow the butterflies!\"""""
"and i need you now tonight, and i need you more than ever, and if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever  and we'll only be making it right, cause we'll never be wrong  together we can take it to the end of the line"
"â€œif ever there is tomorrow when we're not together   there is something you must always remember: you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think  but the most important thing is, even if we're apart   i'll always be with you â€�"

"let's sail away, where no problems can find us  we've got 90 days, to watch that ole <propfemale> sun rise and leave all our troubles behind us  it's gonna be another flip flop summer  love "
"â€œi think we dream so we don't have to be apart so long  if we're in each other's dreams, we can be together all the time â€�"
"i hope it rains on the stupid guy working on the siding of my house, right outside my bedroom window, who keeps hammering and banging on stuff, so i can go back to sleep since he woke me up with all this ruckus! plus it's giving me a headache  sad "
