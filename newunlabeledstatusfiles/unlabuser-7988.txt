"i made honor guard today  i guess my luck is turning \                                                                   - staff sargant c w  mcginnis"
friday was the first time i broke down and cried for 2 hours striaght 
why is it that god put me on this earth just to be screamed at by those i care about?
each day is a test that reveals more about me that i didn't even know 
today we live in a world of hatered and violence  tomorow  well don't e playful ect a tomorow with the way we live 
the day we all get along will be the day we lose our humanity   
i have had it with theses people making me the bad guy!
from what i've learned in this recent conflict i've had is that there is a time to fight and stand up for yourself and theres also a time to just give up when you know you will lose  i'm giving up for good 
well time for me to leave  das vadanya
hey whats up people i'm out for 24 hours and i feel great!!!!
i'll be back home for good soon       peace out -c m
