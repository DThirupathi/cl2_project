"what if i stumble, what if i fall? what if i lose my step and i make fools of us all? will the love continue when my walk becomes a crawl? what if i stumble, and what if i fall?"
"but if we are the body, why aren't his arms reaching? why aren't his hands healing? why aren't his words teaching?    and if we are the body, why aren't his feet going? why is his love not showing them there is a way? there is a way   "
"i am free to run, i am free to dance, i am free to live for you, i am free, yes i am free "
