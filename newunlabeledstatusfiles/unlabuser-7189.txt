"working late tonight, getting ready for a festival in vernonia oregon, this weekend  for those of my friends who are local; come and visit our booth and join the activities "
what caused the crash is that someone was impatient  they were in a big hurry to get somewhere  it cost them and it cost me  i wonder if they think that it was worth the risk  my truck was not just any truck  it was my truck  it was given to me by my late father  while i am truly greatful that everyone escaped serious lifethreatning ijuries and that we are all alive  i feel that part of me has died as well 
"just got home from the tillamook county fair where we watched <propmale> engvall  had some fun, hurts to laugh because of the bruises i recived in sundays accident  impatience can get you hurt, or may result in getting someone else hurt maybe even killed  instead of driving faster to reach your destination leave earlier  because if you drive faster and have an accident in the process did you really gain anything?"
"<propfemale> had her birthday party tonight had a lot of fun, pizza,cake and yes ice cream  now i am surrounded by girls,girls and mor girls  and the drama that goes with it  all  part of being a dad wouldn't change it for anything "
if anyone in the portland metro area knows anyone who rents 3 4 ton or one ton trucks that can be used for pulling a travel trailer please let me know  need one for family camp

it was a good day yesterday  went to church then attended a birthday party that my wife and some of my friends had planned  today was also a good day did not get a whole lot done though  i hope tomorrow is more productive 
had a great evening with friends  we watched the game between university of oregon (ducks)  and ucla  that is if you can call it a game  ucla did not even score a touch down until the middle of the fourth quarter  the final score was 60 to 13 the only way that ucla would have had a <propmale> catch up is if the ducks had sat on the bench and let ucla have the field to themselves 
"had a good day, made a trip to the west side of salem to talk to a perspective client made a few cold calls  the weather was good had a nice drive "
i spent the day working at home today  my back bothered me all night last night and a good part of today  took some meds so i thought i should stay off the road today 
rough night can not sleep  some discomfort  busy day tomorrow so i am going to bed and fall asleep when ever i do 
"my wife and a friend are planning on dying their hair  i asked her what color? her reply was i don't know  i made a couple of suggestions, i thought would look nice  since halloween is tomorrow the civil war game is coming up  i told her she should go with black and orange highlights since she likes the beavers  she glared at me  i knew that was not a consideration  so i suggested she try yellow and green "
"it finally happened i now realize that i must be getting old  i say this because i am having a hard time getting behind the whole halloween thing  i used to love it when i was a kid  we would go down middleton, back around crestwood, stratford, hampton, candlewick, <propmale>  then we would go home put our <propfemale> away and do it again  what fun!"
"inspite of my feelings about halloween we spent time with members of our church family tonight  it included dinner, then we attended a harvest event at a baptist church  we returned to their home, took the kids trick or treating  a ferry, a zombie footbal player, one <propmale> miss vampire  a baby two dogs five adults  i was not surprised about 1 out of 6 houses were handing out <propfemale>  but the kids all had a good time "
"today went by to quick  i slept longer than i should have, then i had an appointment at 2 surprise 0pm that ran until 3 smile 0  stopped by the hospitol to pick up a friend at the emergency room and then on to the house  and now i feel tired again not sure what is going on just seem to not have a lot of energy these days "
"it is wonderful day that our lord has made for us  it is also going to be a busy day  i hope that all my facebook friends and family have a super great day, today  fall is wonderful, so many colors as the leaves change colors  it is cool but not bitter cold "
another great day that our lord has made  i am up and ready for a day of travel and prospecting  meeting new people is only one of the many things i enjoy about this line of work  i hope that all of my facebook friends and family have a wonderful day today

"i don't believe it, the ducks lost  that's just wrong!"
i am looking forward to visiting my cousin this weekend 
"sometimes, no matter how much you believe in something  no matter how much planning you put into it  no matter how hard you work to make it come together, it becomes an up hill battle, time starts to run down, and the clock is ticking  your project becomes a constant struggle  financially you can't afford to quit but he stress builds  when do you throw in the towl?"
what an interesting day on the west coast 
"why do i feel that i am not getting anywhere in life  one short coming after another  they say that when life gives you lemons  then make lemonade, so what do you do with 5,000,000 gallons of this crap?"
"i am feeling really down right now  the home show did not particularly well  i wish that i could have been in arkansas this week, my youngest son is home on leave from afghanistan  would have been nice to spend sometime with him and my daughter-inlaw"
