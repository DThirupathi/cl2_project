i dropped my coffee all over the counter at 7eleven   not cool
"i just realized again for the first time in a long time, that i'm better off alone   "
your the smoke in the air making everone choke   
who's ready to do an all-nighter?  smile 
dude i'm not a <propmale> but the juniors lip-sync was beast!  smile 
ok ok im brutally bored  annoyed 
who knew movies would be such a big deal?!  surprise 
let's hope i don't pee this time   gaby you know what i mean  smile 
"wouldn't it be nice if we were older, then we wouldn't have to wait so long  and wouldn't it be nice to live together, in the kind of world where we belong  smile "
"yesterday i walked home barefoot with my bestfriend, i have blisters but fuck it! i had fun  smile "
"i admit, i miss seeing your face babe   "
this is one of those days where you need your bestfriend  smile

"starlight, <propfemale> bright  birthday candles  11:11  pennies in fountains  dandelions  eyelashes  same wish  same result  nothing "
"that may be all i need\in darkness she is all i see\come and rest your bones with me\driving slow on sunday morning\and i never want to leave"
"someone told me i needed to smile more   \ smile  there happy?"
life is a sexually transmitted disease 
i settle down a twisted up frown disguised as a smile 
i spent my morning running away from a pedophile with a creepy eye 
"i wait for eyelids to touch so i can commence my rest, but instead i just lay there waiting "
who wants to go down memory <propfirst> with me?
are we denying a crisis or are we scared of admitting it?
my tummy hurts and my eyes burn ):
i am so entertained     smile 
mmmmm coffee     smile 
"walked around for an hour outside in the rain, listening to music  smile "
you will hate that i never gave more to you than half of my heart 
such pretty weather today  smile 
"and if i was scared, then i would be glad to tell you and walk away "
say goodbye to my heart tonight;
you can choke on your misery 
tomorrow = torture
you can't kill your father with a toy gun 
"cemetery, mcdonalds, bestbuy, toys r us, fist pumping, west   smile "
"i was blind to the things i did, and deaf to what was said "
"your losing me in that smile \your gonna make it worth my while; lets hope you make it worth my while  smile "
"with my head in the clouds, its hard to see whats going on the floor "
dont you turn my nightmares into dreams again 
"with my instincts along with some bad advice, i'm ready "
"as i strolled down the street the wind knocked some sense into me \\what the hell am i doing with my life?\"""""
i want you in the most unromantic ways 
i like getting high   on swings  smile 
sunday morning rain is falling     smile 
"let's just stop, drop everything, forget each other's names, and just walk away "
"i'm tired of holding up your backup plans \go down your list and be satisfied it's all you have "
"excorcist  stuffed animal fight  failed smores  fire alarm  little campfire  alcoholic smores  cartwheels  \made my day   smile "
wouldn't you say that the world has spit on you enough 
"remember when you were a madman, thought you was batman!"
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  laugh 
stupid blizzard   
 smile 
"i can't believe i did it, but i'm glad i did  smile "
i hate stupid facebook apps    > annoyed 
"damn  i'm going crazy, but insanity sounds better than reality  for those white padded walls might add some light into my life "
now the rain is just washing you out of my hair 
it'll be like it never happened once i leave these memories behind 
"i can't believe the drama that i'm in, the flood is getting closer\i don't think they know that i know how to swim "
"so now i drown my pity, in a pool of sorrow and shame \until the day i forget your name "
"we act as if nothing happened, but we both know whats killing us inside "
"i really need to stop over analyzing stuff,\its starting to give me nightmares "
"i took one big step and i looked away\and then i thought of all the things that i wanted to say\i'm always too late\you never got your story straight \i'm always up late\i think i'm everything you hate"
"you can't wear your mask for too long, for you forgot to cut the holes to breathe "
"let's shed this unclean skin and start to feel again, cause all the shoulders on which to cry are gone "
i said all the right things at all the wrong times 
"yoana avelar, <propmale> de avila, <propfirst> <propmale>, <propmale> cervantes, and <propfirst>  thank's for a fun day  smile "
