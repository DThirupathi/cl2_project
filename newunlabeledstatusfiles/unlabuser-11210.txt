"went out to chevys for my parent's 28th anniversary last night  following in the tradition of attempting to embarrass the person who is celebrating their birthday anniversary special occasion, i managed to successfully sneak away and get the waiters to give them both sombrero hats in the loudest, most obnoxious way possible  total success "
"thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday! i had a wonderful day, and all the comments on here made it even better   smile "
heading to see <propmale>'s play  he's playing sherlock holms  he even has a musical number

<propmale> (our dog) got attacked last night  he's pretty badly beaten up- poor puppy  it was either a really big dog or the local bear that's been hanging around the area  took him to the vet today and got his wounds all taken care of  he's currently resting in the family room and doing well  he's such a good boy! he didn't even yelp when he was getting fixed up 
"amazing migraine news! my tilt-table test went really well! i got a positive result, (i passed out), which is defiantly not normal  this means that weâ€™re finally on the right track in terms of a diagnoses and finding a cure  essentially, what the doctor thinks i have is a condition where my autonomic nervous system, my brain, and my heart do not function properly in relation to my blood flow  (continued in next post)"
"this causes severe, and in some patients constant, migraines  (as well as passing out and a number of other symptoms ) so! we finally seem to be on the right track as far as a diagnoses goes  the best part? itâ€™s treatable!!! iâ€™ve already started this new medicine that treats this condition, and itâ€™s possible that i could start to actually feel better in a few weeks! good news huh? (continued in next post)"
"**crosses fingers** i donâ€™t want to get my hopes up too too much, but the doctor says that the other three patients that heâ€™s had with this condition have responded really well to the medicine and were back to normal in a matter of months  (thatâ€™s the other thing, this is apparently a really rare condition ) iâ€™m feeling pretty optimistic for the first time in awhile   smile "
is about as happy as happy gets 
went from relatively happy to really sad in about three seconds  rest in peace <propfirst> butler  you will be missed greatly 
boise state rules! that fumble into the endzone was awesome 
my mind is becoming one long pink <propmale> song 
"grass valley, california started to cool down    and today it's hot again  when will the wheather\coperate with the fact that it's fall already? anyone else wish it\would cool off?"

"still trying to get back to everyone, but the migraines have been really bad lately  so bear with me guys, i'll get to ya  hopefully sometime soon   smile  also currently working on the wedding pics  after i get back to everyone i'll start posting them "
wanted to go to the game tonight but no one seems to be going  hmmm    guess i might as well get some work done 
"today i talked to my friend about money  she asked if i had bought anything cute with my last check  i told her that no, i put it in the bank for college but am planning on investing in a mutual fund- so did that count? after laughing at me for five straight minutes i was â€œofficially the nerdiest person she knew â€�"
"\the shining\"" is a great book  can't believe i didn't get into <propfirst> <propmale> earlier  now i'm just easting it up  good thing he's written about a billion books """

feeling pretty depressed    death so hard to deal with  sorry to all the people who i need to respond to both on facebook and in email    i just haven't felt like even getting on the computer or doing anything  mayo clinic in minnesota next week and i'm pretty excited nervous impatient  just praying that this will be my big break health wise and that i will start to feel a little happier soon 
just landed in the twin cities! lots and lots of snow here- doesn't seem to be freezing though  (que sigh of relief )
touched down in minneapolis  one flight down- one to go  next stop rochester 
"landed in rochester, minnesota safe and sound- can't wait to get to the hotel! guh  it's been a long day "
"feeling jet lagged but happy  the hotel and mayo clinic are so huge that i feel like such a country girl in the big city  people keep smiling indulgently at me as i point out all the tall buildings- or maybe it's the sweatshirt that has \oregon\"" written on it in big white letters """
"i'm busting at the seams the pain level here is practically nonexistent- or at least by my standards  it's so nice to finally have a break from it, and yet i am so tired i've barely left the hotel room  resolved: i'm going to get off the computer and take a nap, then, i'm going to paint the town red  anybody know of some fun stuff to do in rochester, mn?"
snowing hard here- all flights have been canceled  decided to postpone departure until tomorrow and pray for better weather then  mayo clinic stuff went really well- i'm too tired to elaborate but thanks so much for all of the comments   smile  should have plenty of time to answer them in the airport tomorrow  yikes 
"minnesota is getting hit hard with winter warnings and blizzard conditions, and our flights have been canceled again  (sigh) the earliest we can get out is wednesday, so that's when we'll be departing  at least we managed to watch the news and check our flights online before we left the hotel this morning, other wise we'd be stuck at the airport tonight "
"sitting in the rochester, mn airport  after a week of being thwarted by the weather and my migraines, we're finally on our way home!"
now boarding first flight to minneapolis! wish us luck!
"home safe and sound  attempting to catch up on two weeks of work, but failing miserably "
"ugh  grief is such a fickle thing  one minute you're relatively okay, just skipping along in blissful ignorance, then it hits you all over again  i have to say, music of choice right now is pink <propmale>, the entire dark side of the <propfemale> album  fits the mood "
"<propmale> and his friend are having a sleep-over and, naturally, i'm hiding out in my room  question: why is it that boys sound like drunken monkeys when they get into a group?"
thoughts and prayers go out to japan  help japan by texting redcross 90999  $10 will be added to your phone <propmale>  please re-post and re-tweet!
