great sermon this morning  it is very humbling to think that it was you and me that made jesus want to stay on the cross  he took our sins on himself; imagine the pain of being separated by the heavenly father while on the cross  that pain hurt way more than the physical pain  what will we do for him?

praise the lord for the great week we had at camp  i was challenged in many ways to live for god more and to really get to know him better  i wish that all my friends could have heard the evangelist speak  he was an amazing guy who loved the lord and had a passion for teens  the lord used him in a powerful way  many teens got saved and others dedicated their life to god and to full time ministry
