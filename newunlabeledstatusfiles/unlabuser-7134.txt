"conformar-se Ã© submeter-se e vencer Ã© conformar-se, ser vencido  por isso toda a vitÃ³ria Ã© uma grosseria  os vencedores perdem sempre todas as qualidades de desalento co o presente que os levaram Ã  luta que lhes deu a vitÃ³ria  ficam satisfeitos, e satisfeito sÃ³ pode estar aquele que se conforma, que nÃ£o tem a mentalidade do vencedor  vence sÃ³ quem nunca consegue "
