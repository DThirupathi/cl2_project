why is it when i start to like someone and i mean really like someone something happens and i have to end up leaving  it sucks and it hurts and i hate it 
"hmmm idk anymore  whats the point in getting your hopes up to have them destroyed, opening your heart up to just have it ripped out and trampled on in front of you? i'm done with it all  not going to take the pain anymore i am giving up on you and there ever being an us  i have held on to my feelings long enough  im letting them go and setting myself free "
what to do? idk about this anymore  maybe i should give up and not even try 
"its funny how u can luv some1 so much & they have no clue  its funny how u can look in2 their eyes & get butterflies  u wish u had the courage 2 say something, 2 let them no u care  that will always b there 4 them even in the darkest times  there comes a point when they will disappear  they will find some1 new cuz the whole time u were waiting 4 them   they were waiting 4 u "
