everyone needs to message the runners of facebook and tell them they need to add an unlike button! that would most magnificent!!!
sometimes i wonder why i stopped drinking   i slept so good today   it was amazing!!! might pick up drinking again!!!!
what is it with all these websites changing their mobile pages on people   new iphone   page! wtf
"no work for me tonight, going to take it easy   rip to my uncle <propmale> drenning, you will be missed!"
"is it like a law that if you have family on fb they think you must be their friends? well if i don't know you, even if you have the same last name    i will not add you!!!"
i hate being here when you are not! i feel as though i am not complete unless you are here with me! i couldn't imagine my life with out now that i have found you! i can't wait till you are here beside me where you belong!
"feeling pretty crappy   forgot to take my allergy pill yesterday, and now i'm feeling the affects!!! wish they kick in quick before i lose my mind   definitely allergic to everything right now!"
i just had a horrible night mare! and now i can't stop worrying   argh   scared to go back to sleep   dont want to be alone so i wish i could go back to sleep!
i love drinking!!!!
"gonna sleep like a baby, i love storms!!!"
let me just say this!!!! i don't care if you weigh 100lbs or 1000lbs wear some freaking clothes honestly no one really wants to see that much of you   men may like it but guess what once you get a bf or whatever he won't want to see you wearing shit like that in public! and ffs   it's 39degrees!!!!!!
so for those of you that care   at&t fucking rocks!!! so i'm slowly waiting for upgrade   not till july   i got an email from them telling me they are giving me early upgrade!!! because i'm an awesome customer!!! woot woot i rock too apparently!!!
"ever have a day that you wish could just start over? my knee is killing me, i had to climb into the compactor at work, and then well was having a great morning and then it turned sour   and now it's better than it was "
"can things really get any worse??? and as i write this my fan in my room started making a horrible noise, so yes <propfemale> it could! just great!!!"
so hopefully this dark cloud that has decided to <propfemale> out with me is gone! because if not i don't know how much more i can handle before i lose my mind!
so this is so exciting!!!! no more hell fridays!!! this fuc*ing rocks!!!
<propmale> is the best!! just saying   and i don't feel well    crying 
working easter <propfemale> tonight   there is so much   i think 56 total!!!! now that's just <propfemale> not the plastic eggs and stuff of that nature    gonna be a long night   
i'm so over this night already   too much <propfemale> not enough room   there is <propfemale> everywhere ohh my   well i get to see those cute little step kids of mine in the morning!!!! whoop whoop!!
so our government is f'ed up!!!! just saying   let's keep our troops over seas spending more money   putting us deeper in debt   for a country that doesn't want us there   and let's cut allowances to bull crap things   like a health care project that doesn't go into affect until 2014   umm it shouldn't have money if it doesn't exist yet!
in an odd mood right now   don't know why but i am   just one of those days i guess   and i am so off on everything right now   argh it's only wednesday                 2more nights till my glorious 2nights off!
"its amazing when you think of it i swear   5 years ago i would have been in class   sitting there waiting to go home and <propfemale> out with some friends   now i'm at home, getting ready to go to bed till my fiancee comes home   omg time does really fly!!!"
nothing scares me more than losing the only one i want   
did you know that only 42% of americans have jobs???? that's insane!!!
"so exactly a year ago, i found out that my mother had passed away   doesn't seem like it has been that long, r i p  <propfemale> <propfemale> drenning!"
"warning, please read - i don't usually re-post these but    if someone comes to your front door, and asks you to remove your clothes, and dance in your front yard with your arms in the air   do not do this, it is a scam!! they just want to see you naked  please copy and post this to your status -- i wish i had received this yesterday     i feel so stupid now  "
so how crazy is it that i'm seriously wondering if walmart would let us get married at walmart? i mean hell i practically live there and sometimes i think about work more than i do my house   would seem fitting to get married there!
so have i mentioned how great <propmale> is??? started us on registering   woot woot   i'll let you all know when we actual start putting things on there   and we just had an amazing time together!!!!
so   i want to go do some yoga   but the storms have me stressing   so i think i'll wait until the bad part has passed   
some days i just wish i could go to an alternate reality of some sort   just me and <propmale> no one else   in the middle of nowhere   where we can do as we please   that would be the life! of course we would come back    eventually
well that was a great 5 <propfemale> nap   let's try that again some other time   
having a great easter morning with the boys   love mornings when i have all my favorite males in the same house!
i'm already ready for this night to be over

feeling a bit irritated   don't know why   just do   wish it was 7 so we can leave here   
"having an ok night, still can't wait till 7 so we can leave  i hope the school is still flooded so <propmale> can go back to the house with us  would be great if julien wouldn't have school too but that probably won't happen!"

omg since i got rid of some of my likes that i had on here   i can see people's status'  i'm so geeked! just thought that everyone should know this 
after this last week i am really going to enjoy my two nights off! the only thing that could make it better would be if <propmale> was off too 
making <propmale> watch striptease   i think he's enjoying it!
i'm so geeked   i'm getting the boys over night on saturday night!!! woot woot!!! i can't wait!!!

now i'm happier   got rid of a person i forgot to delete off my friends list! i hate being treated as though i don't exist but only when they want me there! fuck it   i can delete you out of my life just like that! i'm not a rug   hopefully she gets the hint and doesn't try and talk to me   i'm done! just like that!
i feel like shit   i hope i start feeling better soon! i don't feel like i'm going to get anything done tonight with the way i feel!
i hate my insurance company!!! i just woke up in pain because my tooth is throbbing and guess what i was supposed to have my surgery yesterday morning at 9 and because i haven't been with my insurance company for a year yet (even though i swear i have) i couldn't have the surgery today!!! i'm so upset all i want to do is cry!
