<propmale> potter and the half-blood <propmale>'s rating makes me think that it's going to be less actiony when it's supposed to be darker and scarier as it gets closer to to 2-part deathly hallows   i don't like that fact
going to get a digital camera on saturday and then hopefully i can get a laptop in a few months
