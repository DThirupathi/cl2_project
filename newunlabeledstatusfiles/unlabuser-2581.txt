dont talk to me in that tone of voice    
i will never do anything to hurt or harm you  and no matter how many times you try to give up i wont let you down  because i will always be underneath you to lift your head above the water  thats my one promise to you 
"sitting here six in tha mornin, after talking to you for what damn near ten hours  just watching the sunrise thinking about how every inch it moves brings me one step closer to you "
how can i sit here and be mad at you when every minute i rage i waste sixty seconds in which i could have told you how much i love you 
the easiest solution is to just walk away forever 
can i just say that when i come to a fork in my trail i get scared run and create my own new path 
freakin bruise on the side of my face  yay for brawlin it out
"i try and forget, everything i know, everything you told me, and even the things you haven't, because they are in the past, and because you are my present and my future "
