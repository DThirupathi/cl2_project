don't let someone elses opinion of you decide your opinion of yourself!
"face value depreciates over time ,but a true heart is forever"
"got home from work at 5 smile 0 ,i get out of the car and a b-17 w w 2 bomber flies right over the house, had to be only 500 ft  high, wow!!!!!!"
sat out in the yard tonight listening to the frogs and the crickets the stars were beautiful 
"face value depreciates over time ,but a true heart is forever!"
it doesn't matter if the glass is half empty or half full as long as it doesn't go to waste!
never give up  even if you fall flat on your face your still going in a forward motion 
"<propfemale>, true friends will understand don't feel bad for something that is beyond your control "
how do you get the courage out of discourage 
nurture your mind with great thoughts for you will never go higher than you think
