"the baby is sleeping sound but i cant seem to fall asleep and stay alseep     i knew having a baby would be hard work (but worth it) - what i didnt e playful ect is how a <propfemale>, new person can keep you busy, busy, busy!"

i just posted 3 new pictures of <propmale>!  they are so damn cute its awful!
"i don't get it!  how can such a relatively small amount (formula and or breast milk) go into a baby and such a large amount (talkin' about baby poop!) come out of the same baby?  \\'what goes up must come down' i learned in school   'what goes in must come out' i learned well within days of my sons birth   both make sense     but how can 6 ounces go in and a whole lot more end up coming out?"
<propfirst> has refused to eat several times which is nothet him at all! he got 3 shots on mon and i was e playful ecting some of whats going on but he is feeling far more miserable than i had e playful ected 
"anyone with more 'mommy e playful erience' than my 13 weeks know how long i can e playful ect this to go on?  any recommendations (or warnings) about bangor area pediatricians? i havent liked his current dr since just minutes into meeting for the first time     no disrespect meant but i need to feel comfortable with and have overall generally positive visits, interactions, etc and the current one is     well, not those things "
"<propmale> bear lyrics â€œi love to rub his chubby tummy\and hug his rolly <propfemale> body\when <propmale> cuddles close beside me\we always make each other happy\and when i toss him high above me\and catch him gently as a feather\i can almost hear his laughter\so glad that we can be togetherâ€�"
something i would never have imagined ever saying in my lifetime: â€œplease donâ€™t suck on your dirty diaper!â€� my little man is 15 weeks old today - where has the time gone?
"i am 100% sure that <propmale> said his first real word today! lately i have thought his babbles have sounded like '<propfemale>' and sometimes '<propfemale>-<propfemale>' but its early for that so i couldnâ€™t fully believe it was really more than a coincidence but he said â€œ<propfemale>-<propfemale>â€� for sure today â€¦ and more than once! i wasnâ€™t the only one to hear it so i really know it isnâ€™t just the i<propfemale>gination of an overly proud, in love head-over-heels mom!!"
"*warning: insomniac venting* i donâ€™t understand how a man could know they fathered a child & not care the slightest bit  never wanting to meet or know about the child â€¦ not even being curious enough to want a picture  putting effort into denying and avoiding everything  anyone, especially the guys reading this, have any thoughts or insights or anything on this?"
going on 4am and i havent been able to sleep 'cuz of a horrible toothache - if i had a pair of pliers i think i might just be capable of using them to pull the damned tooth!
can anyone help me? there are codes on all coke product caps which iâ€™ve been collecting but am running out of time to get what id like to be my nanas xmas present  i would be really grateful if anyone sends me even one codeâ€¦please!
i had an appointment in bangor so i got <propmale> all bundled up and in his infant car seat carrier then locked up and headed outside  the minute <propmale> saw the snow that was covering everything (and still coming down) he started crying  a kid after my own heart!
must be genetic!  my little man dislikes mornings as much as i do!
"ok, i am not too great with computers and the like so i could use some suggestions   i have a lot of movies, full seasons of several tv series, etc video files which are 95% avi format & a good amount of audio files mostly in mp3 format     i want to transfer them onto a storage 'whatever' so i can delete off my laptop   what would be best to use?  dvd? flash drive?  suggestions anyone?  thanks"
"another milestone!  i had <propfirst> in my lap while sittiing on the floor infront of the coffee table when he reached out with both hands and stood up using his hands for the minimal amount on balance he neeed   shocked!  6 months old today, too!"
"anyone else seen 'the black swan'?  hollywood, media, etc made such commotion about the film being deserving of an <propfirst> (or whatever award) that i watched it  maybe its just me but i dont understand how its supposed to be so great "
"anyone have e playful erience or knowledge about consumer cellular??  i am contemplating getting service through them - plans, price, etc great fit for me but i am hesitant given that i know nothing about consumer cellular other than what is on their website "

"i know!  i know i know i know what <propfirst> and <propfemale> are having and while it was worth waiting up this late i am now off to bed     ha, 9pm was never 'late' before my crash course into motherhood!"
anyone want to do something nice and help make my day?  i have been collecting the codes from coke products caps but still am short of the total i need to get the reward i have been working towards but i still need a good amount to points to get the reward (prize) i want from mycokerewards com     prettly please?
"anyone with e playful erience have a suggestion?  <propmale> is 8 months & has recently taken to making 'poop <propmale>' at night  i end up with a stinky, messy, couldnâ€™t-be-too-healthy mess in the morning   only thing that worked a little has been putting the bugger to bed in 1 piece sleep-n-plays so he doesnâ€™t have easy diaper access  getting him into them not easy and hasnâ€™t even fully stopped him "
"i am not seeing things!  a few nights lately i had told myself that being tired, etc was the e playful lanation for the movement i *thought* i saw out of the corner of my eye   makes sense and what could really make such brief, fast, etc appurtenances and be gone before i could really get a look?  well, a mouse!  that is what it was and i got proof tonight   i need to get back to looking for a kitten young cat to adopt!"
so ready for spring    
any of you out there with small children still in diapers use pampers brand (both the diapers themselves and also wipes) not use the codes for gifts to grow?  if so would you be kind enough to send any you might have around my way??  smile 
"an idea: contribute outgrown clothes toys to be added to outgrown items from other parents   sizes, etc currently needed for baby child would be sent in return for items you donate to the â€˜collectionâ€™   if there were enough parents interested in doing this then i think it could work wonderfully and save a lot of money   feedback?  interested in participating?"
"does anyone know if, here in the state of maine, a person must posses a valid (not e playful ired) license in order to (re)register their vehicle?"
