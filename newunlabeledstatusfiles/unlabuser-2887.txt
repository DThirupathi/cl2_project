"enjoying this week (though i didn't get that flat), glad i've got work lined up again on monday   i'm only teaching a pm class this week, but yesterday i ran errands downtown first thing and then went to the school to camp out: managed to land 2 extra hours of relief work for being in the right place at the right time   this morning i was able to see <propmale> off properly to school for the first time in months "
up early so did a bit of editing work   looking forward to the weekend--it's a christoph one and we'll be 'hanging out' (i believe that's the proper term) with <propmale> and taking him along to a games night on saturday:  a <propmale> to play alhambra (one of christoph's birthday gifts) with more than two players

"after one false start when he got called away to see some ceo in wellington, the ex met me at family court yesterday, which was the 20th at about 4 pm   we were both aware of the symbolism of the date and time  our marriage should be 'dissolved' in about a month's time "
"a week of milestones:  filed to dissolve my marriage to <propfirst> and i've just now signed a lease for a new place, the first time in my life i've rented a place by myself, at the tender age of almost 39   (but my students thought i was much younger, 25-35, ha ha!)"
"if i didn't already feel lucky:  today i'm looking & feeling like death warmed over & who has just departed, enthusiastically, into the rain for dinner provisions? so christoph even ticks the 'takes care of me when i'm sick' button    smile   earlier we scored a couple of things for my new place at the labour day sales & i was in need of supervision b c amusingly (?) i keep turning into the giggling girl "
"+ the doctor thinks it's probably a virus and didn't urge me to buy life insurance!   -  i have to miss quiz tonight  + i got a lot of arrangements made for my upcoming move    -  i have to miss work at least until thursday and no work, no pay on these short term contracts + the ex came through with a significant amount of overdue support "

"back to work today, though still not operating at 100% capacity:  had a couple of fits of giggles and now i'm so tired   in a week's time i'll be getting the key to my new place and thanks to some help packing boxes this weekend  love , trade me and the pink bag people, i'm feeling more and more like this move is do-able "
"i've got a little trademe bidding war going on over a small lockable filing cabinet   today it's gone from $5 up to $27 and from $0 50 to $1 00 increments   and i think i've realized why:  i described it as having \attractive blond wood with silver handles \""  do i have a way with words or what?  lol"""
"today is significant in two ways:  it marks nine years for me in new zealand (and i think it's safe to say i've come a long way) and i get the keys to my new flat   have a great week, everyone "
"glad i went to quiz tonight and contributed to our second place finish   i so needed a break from the move   the thing that sucks, normally i'd be jazzed by all these logistical challenges, but since i'm still battling remnants of the 'man flu' i'm frazzled instead "
"got a lot done today which is all good since the movers are coming *tomorrow*   please everyone, cross your fingers for no rain "
"thank you, auckland, for a warm <propfemale> day   and the movers managed to get all my stuff into my new place, despite access being tricky--they had to remove my screen door and i think my entertainment center was rotated 360 degrees   now i've got to deal with all the stuff lying around the old place still   first a wee lie down   "
"i've survived the move!  christoph (and the ex, credit where credit is due) were a huge help, as was my friend <propfemale>   i'm off to relief teach today then it's back to unpacking, but the new place isn't looking half bad and i'm feeling quite house proud actually "
"it's the little things:  i was looking at my car lighter cell phone charger and realized if i took the part that goes into the lighter off, the rest would interface with my computer   and lo and behold, my cell phone is now charging off my computer!"
"looking forward to quizzing tonight at the reef with christoph and our friends  just as well we should write our answers down though; i'm still not sounding good   happy not working today:  slept in, ran errands and am continuing the settling in process   still loving my new flat!"
"christoph is having his knee surgery today and he's completely blase about it, but i will be having a nervous breakdown while it's happening   please send some good thoughts our way this afternoon "
"i made a stuffed chicken and all the trimmings for dinner yesterday and with christoph watching live feeds of american football games, including the broncos, it did feel like thanksgiving   i told him this year i'm most thankful for having him in my life as it's the difference between surviving and living    love "
christoph's fine but his recuperation seems like it's going to take longer than e playful ected   tomorrow i'm teaching a trial lesson; if the school likes me they may offer me some work in january   otherwise (yawn) nothing much happening 
"omg:  forgot to mention that i'm now officially divorced (or as they say in nz, my marriage has been dissolved)   the papers arrived yesterday "
"from the news:  \the grandmother of <propfirst> wood's russian girlfriend has called the rocker 'a nightmare'\""   no doubt because he spurned her more age-appropriate advances on his way to robbing the cradle?"""
"curiously, i've become quite adept at making schnitzel   "
"christoph had his follow-up with the surgeon, who was pleased with his progress   no need for physio and he can even go back to the gym if he takes it easy   we'll see some of you at quiz on tuesday i e playful ect    meanwhile, my 'little boy' has his graduation from primary school today, and he's got stage fright because he's got a large speaking part in the assembly "
"today marks exactly one year that i noticed a new guy signed up to go to an fso <propfemale>nt and i sent him a short, friendly message   the rest, as they say, is history   i'd have to say this was the best birthday gift to myself <propfemale>r, easily surpassing the dream i'd had on the <propfemale> of my birthday the year before, in which my mil succumbed to fumes from cleaning products (which wouldn't be out of character, lol)!"
"thanks for the birthday wishes   it was a nice one, capped by victory at the pub quiz   i'm actually having a part two   my parents arrive tomorrow and on friday evening i'll have dinner out with them, christoph and <propmale> and then we're going to the trotting track "
"my parents got in safely yesterday and are ensconced at the metropolis on the 30th floor, harbour view--i like to say they're spending my inheritance   and tonight the dad meets the boyfriend   "
"looking forward to quiz tonight   bringing my dad   last night christoph and i played as a team of two at the dogs bollix and came in 4th out of 10    christmas?  oh yeah, damn, i guess i should keep making preparations   so hard to believe it's around the corner, even with the tree ensconced in my living room "
"cookies, check   pumpkin pie, check (in oven even as i type)   next up, scallops florentine (eat your heart out, <propfemale>) and finishing touches on my homemade christmas dress   <propfemale> christmas everyone, whether you're buried under east coast snow or enjoying california or kiwi sun "
"with three weeks' work lined up from january 5 to keep the wolf at bay, i'm enjoying each lazy summer day "
"teaching again, at a school where the classes are really small "
"quizzing again now too   came third with christoph, enough for bar credit, yesterday!  only one point off second   and tonight it's back to the reef   dad is coming along again too   wonder if he'll be able to find pub quizzes back in the states   "
"what's on my mind?  the usual   oh, and i ran over a goat in my bathroom because i'm not crazy "
still acclimating to having a <propmale> as my computer   anyone know what software program might be on here for editing pictures?  eliminating red eye was so easy on the old pc:  you could just click and drag a box over the area containing the red <propfemale> and the computer replaced red with black   
"auckland friends:  dad and i are going to the trotting track (<propfemale> park) tonight, if anyone wants to join to win lose some money    smile   we'll be hanging out near the lyell creek area on the 2nd floor, as usual "
"poor <propmale>!  he was eating an ice cream cone and walking in the city with dad and me when we were accosted by six teenage girls, who asked him where he got his cone   before the poor kid could get a word out, my father took over and directed them to the place   he is now moaning that grandpa stole his women!"
started yet another new teaching gig today and it went better than i'd feared it might   a bit of turmoil on the personal front though   
"nice weekend, even though dad went back    and slipped me $150 and a bus card with $24 on it   is this the man i grew up with?  invested some of that dosh in a nice anniversary dinner with my darling at tabou in kingsland   also got to see some buskers and most of the murray-federer match   poor <propmale>!"
snow days   had a laugh with my colleague's swedish wife about this concept yesterday   do any of my baltimore friends remember the time schools were cancelled on threat of snow the next day?  i think we were middle-school-aged at the time 
going to the reef quiz with bookworm tonight; here's hoping there are science and geography rounds   getting observed at work tomorrow   oh and my flat is looking really sharp now  over the weekend i got the last odds and ends in the living room put away   and today i bought houseplants (note the plural)   i haven't bought houseplants since i moved to nz   what does this mean?
"i'm having a quiet night in, painting my toenails, grading tests, reading a novel and watching tv   simultaneously of course!"
"just found out i have to be let go a week before my contract's up   i could see it coming, enrollments have been falling and next week i'll only have five students in my class    but still     sad "
"i haven't been out of nz for nearly 3 5 years now   the one vow i made to myself this year (well, there's one other but it's not for pubic declaration on fb) is that i'm getting out for a while, even if it's a long weekend package deal to a pacific island that uses (sigh) nz currency   so today it's to the consulate to drop off my passport renewal form "
made a mature decision today   hopefully next time she can do it without preceding it with a temper tantrum and trawling for cyber-pats on the head via fb afterward!
yesterday was so bad* today can only be better   right?  right? *of course i mean bad in kind of a coddled middle class sort of way   it's not like i got swept away in a flood or came down with malaria   still   
is indeed regaining her equilibrium   which means i'll be above water when the next wave hits me 
"we are the (pub quiz) champions, my friend!  100 points tonight, out of 110 possible   yours truly contributed much, including recognizing a childhood mug shot of <propfirst> duchovny and knowing the yo yo was invented in the philippines   i wish my knowledge of trivia was a heavily paid marketable skill!"
"hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back in town    smile   time for a happier profile pic again "
"ten years ago today was my 8th wedding anniversary  i was a stay-at-home mom living in california, wholly financially dependent on my husband  today i live in new zealand, i'm divorced, my son is 13, i have a lease in my own name for the first time, i'm a breadwinner and i'm in a relationship with a wonderful man   what was your life like 10 years ago?"

"finished up with the beginners yesterday; they still need a separate class, but sadly their <propfirst> do not warrant it   today and possibly tomorrow i've got substitute work   ho hum   we're finally getting rain and now that we've had daylight savings, i think i need to begin work on my plan to spring myself from nz for a short, hopefully tropical break, perhaps ca  september   suggestions?"

"remember needing intermediaries to deal with the opposite sex?  <propmale>' girlfriend broke up with him and gave her dear <propfirst> to his friend to deliver  fortunately it was met with hilarity and not heartbreak   the little vixen is clearly a professional--even gives him the old, 'it's not you, it's me' "
"today someone else's student had an epileptic seizure   i didn't remember everything you're supposed to do, but i got her into recovery position, talked to the emergency operator and stayed with her until help came   after it was all over, i went through a brief period of shock:  after all i'm quite squeamish, but apparently not too much in a pinch "
