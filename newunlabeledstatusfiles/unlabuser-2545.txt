"okay, so there's a cosmic jewish zombie who was his own father and can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because some rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree    yep, christianity makes sense "
listening to siouxie and the banshees!  love 
"please put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons  dragons are nearly unstoppable, and in case you didn't know, they can breathe fire  60% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons  38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers  the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this  please share-knowledge is power"
when you have feelings for someone things will always work out even if it seems the universe puts obstacles in your way to prevent you from seeing them  love
