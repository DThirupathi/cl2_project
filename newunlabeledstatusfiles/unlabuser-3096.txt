we're trying just to convince the world we're something that we can't be we are not afraid of being alone of being caught by oursselves with only our own thoughts
"to die is to know that you're alive and my river of blood won't run dry i never wanted to lose you, no but a cold heart is a dead heart and it feels like i've been buried alive by love"
love's icy tomb dug open for you lies in a cemetery that bears my name love's violent tune from me to you rips your heart out and leaves you bleeding with a smile on your face kill me i begged and love said no leave me for dead and let me go kill me i cri

all the things you've done wrong rebellious at heart all along is your leader a voice? somehow you replaced all your game with a debt now the payback's a sin why owe your life to a sin? absolutely pathetic and regret it when told you are made of mistakes 
"is the blood stainless? enjoy the pain with accepting your grief are you finished? dumb  question, don't let yourself fall asleep ressurect the intention once your vision is now mass-produced, imagine the insults a blessing imagine accepting the truth"
"put me away again every now and then your bottle spinning my fate as i hold my breath and you say you don't want any part of this now where did it go so wrongi guess i'm finally finding out it's got me tripping now the little things, everywhere i go it's "
"those things i never thought you'd do you got the best of me you got the best of me, when you said you didn't love me anymore and i know, this will be the last time you've got me, running in circles like a freak so why do you try, to kick me when i'm down"

"how to break a heart it is not difficult anyone can do it so could you, if you tried just find a light and switch it off as easy as blinking that's what i was taught when i was too young to ask by ladies in white nightgowns in dripping weeds and black rib"
"you're everything that's why i cling to you when i emerge my thoughts converge to you to you the world is so small compared to you and everybody's wrong compared to you to you i begin to see through your eyes all the former mysteries are no su rprise so now, you listen cuz i'm omniscient hey look at me lady i'm just a little baby you're lucky to have me i'm cute and sweet as <propfemale> as charming as a fable i'm innocent"

there's a flame that leads our souls astray no one's safe from its tender touch of pain and every day it's looking for new slaves to celebrate the beauty of the grave we are like the living dead sacrificing all we have for a frozen heart and a soul on fire we are like the living dead craving for deliverance with a frozen heart and a soul on fire
i wake up in the basement i must be here sleepwalking mustn't i? getting up from my easy chair looking for my wife following a trail of crimson spots that lead into the night suddenly i realize i see it all through real eyes these crimson spots are dripping from my hand and ooh it makes me feel like a man
"i don't want to see you go, i don't even want to be there  i will cover up my eyes and pray it goes away  you've only lived a minute of your life i must be dreaming, please stop screaming  i don't like to hear you cry  you just don't know how deep that cuts me  so i will cover up my eyes and it will go away  you've only lived a minute of your life i must be dreaming, please stop screaming "

"ready yourself for the end ready yourself cause you cannot pretend ready yourself for the late, for the great the destroyerâ€™s surrounded and cannot defend the lives that you thought that were yours to devour destroyer, the tables have turned in this hour the plagues you unleashed, every vice that you fed shall be visited here tenfold on your head let go cause you know in the end all you were was a pawn in the show"
"why can't i sleep and i don't understand what keeps me breathing i'm waiting for you, i know your leaving i'll still adore you you'll never need me to hold on, i found another way to let you go   you found another way to bleed my soul  "
i believed in nothing but you believe in me i thought that life was worthless but you told me i'm a <propfemale>
i have never felt i had a home even in a crowd i felt alone i'd almost given up on life i'm fully determined now and never thought i'd ever feel again
i've never been loved by an angel until tonight your heaven filled my room she showed me love could lift me higher with a kiss she reparied these broken wings she revived my fading spirit restored my faith in everything
i find love humilating sick and desperate need that drains me god i hope i never feel again but i've never been loved by an angel i've never felt anything so pure
"i believed that love was sacred as i dove blindly into her sea you see, that warm embrace felt more like drowning as endless waves crashed over me she was an insatiable black hole feeding off my mind and off my soul"
"those haunting rhymes are keeping the time, but they'll never get through to me  it's my party, but i'm waiting for someone to start it  it's my party, there's no one but me in the corner  gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't i?"

we have to prove that our love is real over and over again but let them think what they want i know it will never end because i know where it began and my heart still heart still pounds twice as fast whenever you walk by cause i still love you
so i think ill stay caught up in a silent prayer i believe in silence our hearts speak the same word so why dont we just walk along the shoreline with a silent song cause i believe in silence our hearts speak the same word
its common knowledge that youve been dead for a while its well known that the cross is only a burden with pains and trials but then again how come my shoes are so light how come i can walk for <propmale> and still just love you
they wont see the fire you have lit inside of me they look up to the stars and wonder where you might be they look up without realizing that theyre standing right there in the palm of your hand i cant e playful lain or understand i just love you
convinced of my deception i've always been a fool i fear this love reaction just like you said i would a <propfemale> could never lie about the love it brings and i could never promise to be any of those things if i was not so weak if i was not so cold if i was not so scared of being broken growing old i would be    frail
"i never thought that you  who would believe that i wasn't good enough? those things i never thought you'd do you got the best of me you got the best of me, when you said you didn't love me anymore  "
might shave my head out of  a bitter rage!  wink  ha ha!

"remember me when you're the one who's silver screened, remember me when you're the one you always dreamed, remember me whenever noses start to bleed, remember me, special needs,remember me when you clinch your movie deal, and think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels, remember me through flash photography and screams, remember me, special dreams  "
time to take my way threw the arkham asylum again  !!
"no matter what i do it's never good enough  i give all that is me; still it's never enough  so, why try? i give up   what does it feel like to be in your shoes  and walk over everyone like you do? take me down again, i want you to   you're lovely, so beautiful and you're perfect in every way  your interior rusted and i'm so disgusted  can't trust it "
"so much to say so little time for me, to e playful lain the way i feel  you only see, things the way you want to see them it makes sense to you all these things you do  youâ€™ve got it all figured out while everyone is confused  how do you do it?  in your mind i'm just blind  you're right all of the time  if i think for myself, i guess i'm way out of line  i'm not who you are  i'm so sorry"

a prey she was for the cruelty of love while its serpent inside crawled straight towards her heart the coldest kiss love ceased to exist while we grew apart like never before and love wants us dead   just for her and love's heart is death  the fire in her eyes grew dim and then died as the poison inside reached her heart and the coldest bliss faith ceased to exist
the world was on fire no one could save me but you  strange what <propfemale> will make foolish people do i never dreamed that i'd meet somebody like you and i never dreamed that i'd lose somebody like you what a wicked game you play to make me feel this way what a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you what a wicked thing to say you never felt this way what a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
