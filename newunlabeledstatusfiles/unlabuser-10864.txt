"when i was with <propfirst>, \my heart had returned home to where it truly belonged and still does  it\ does not where she is, but as long as i am with her, i am home"
"if any man could stand in my place, they would be able to feel just how lucky i am and know that i am possibly the luckiest man alive to this very day and farther than that "
i wish i could be with <propfirst> in this moment  to just sit with her without a single word is like a moment in heaven 
so much warmth fills my heart as i read and remember the words i have written and spoken about <propfirst>  the love that swells in my heart is such a blessing 
"everything i do, everwhere i look, everything reminds me of <propfirst>  there is never a moment of the day that i do not think of her "
i love <propfirst>
i have finally started writing newer compositions on cello and now piano in my collection called: 'the songs of a lovebird ' each song is about <propfirst> and i  i hope that one day i can play them for her 
<propfirst> makes me feel like i'm the luckiest man ever born  i love her so much and through out and past all time i will still love her more and more 
i have begun writing new songs for <propfirst> and i think they are really good for the first  though why should i e playful ect any less- it's for <propfirst>  she is the reason for everything good in me 
"i miss <propfirst>, but i will make it through anything just to be with her again "
