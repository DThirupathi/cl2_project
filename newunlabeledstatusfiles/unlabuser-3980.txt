"dislikes vampire weekend  except for that one song that keeps getting stuck in her head  also is considering opening up her facebook  oh, the horror!"

thinks she missed something 
"dude  i guess i'm here now, since i'm moving on from wsu and more than half of you buggers don't have phones, or something-somesuch  what the hell is this facebook and why am i giving into the trend?!"
i shouldn't put so much stock into shit that really won't matter in the long run 
"my cellphone is lost dead maimed crucified somewhere out there, so don't bother texting me  trying to get a hold of people is hard!"
"got my new phone, but i have no contacts anymore  if you still have my number, text me and i'll save you~"
"one 85 down with heroic gear, one more to go! fuu, leveling is so slow when you only have regular flying "
"i've got to start getting to the gym! new year's resolution, here i come~ (abiet late)"
"so, lazy day games (the new <propfemale> center in wichita) calls  apparently they had seen me at the halo reach tourny and want me to work there, going through the wti console <propfemale> files, calling my mom just to get my number, then calling me  \\guess i'm the only gamer female they know that's above a 4  lol "
"man, couldn't go to work today  <propfemale> was buried in snow  snowmobile!"
trying to give a shit about other games when i really don't  all that's left is rift!
dance away the hate!
why be sad when things are gonna be okay?
"ohoho, last night was a bad idea   love "
"myan, this too shall pass~"
