tired of working but i am goimg to make that money  some people don't have a job so i will try not to complain
why is it the more you try to do what is right the more shit you have to put up with  now i see why people do what they do tired of all the bullshit
try to live life to the fullest and make a better me
today just relaxing thanking god for the strength he gives me to do what i have to do to do and for give me the strength to belive in me
i was talking to a friend today and she let me know that an  old friend has passed away  death is not a bad thing it is the one thing that we were promise  it is only sad when we go so early in life  to all my friends and family know yourself become who you are meant to be and live life like it is you last  love you all and stay blessed
my grandmother is 81 that is such a blessing happy b day granny love you
in life we take things for granted not knowing how long we have with each other  intil you are face with your own time running out only then do you truly understand life itself and how little time we actually have so love one another 
so much darkness but that is ok i will just trying to wait for the breaking <propfemale> so then i may shine again  like the fire bird from the ashes i will rise
hey fb fam just chilling today trying to relax and not let life get to me  i cant really complain because i am blessed i have a wonderful family and friends and a good job that pays the bills and some  so i am more then blessed i am charmed
up early this morning about to take care of some biz  hope everybody has a blessed and wonderful day
hello fb up and ready to roll with today  cant belive i am going to say that i am ready to go back to work kind of miss lol something is wrong with me lol
at work working a double well the whole 3 shift is lol trying to enjoy what i can
just got off from working my 2nd double in a row but it is all good going to make that money lol
get ready to prepare for another long night at work and trying to figure out were to take a good long nice vacaction after all is said and done
just happy and thankful that everything turned out the way i hoped and want to say thanks to me support team it is so nice to know that you are loved no matter what the odds are and if youare reading this then you know what i am talking about thanks again for getting me throught these last 3 weeks
in a great mood today everything is looking up  and things are finally starting to make sense life is like a book just when you think think it cant get any better it do
its funny how people come around when they need you but when you are in need its you against the world  dame its a good thing that i am growing stronger each day and starting to learn to stand on my own or i would be lost  like some other sad souls
its hard sometimes to deal with life and its suprise as well as it let downs  i just try to remeber that the mission is the only thing that matters  what  i do to get were i need to be  and if i can still stomach how i got their
you know it is hard to know which path is the right path to be taking  just like in life the roads are hard with a lot o twist and turns  sometimes you can see clear as day and same times the rain can be too much  lol thats life i guess
in life we have choices  some hard and some real easy to make  yet we tend to stress over things that don't matter  i am finally making the choice to let the world solve its on problems and start to make sure my own back yard is clean before i run off and play superman with other people life (help others fix their issues) you can't save the world only yourself 
thanks for all the happy b day my twin and i  had agood time and i hope everyone has a happy labor day
