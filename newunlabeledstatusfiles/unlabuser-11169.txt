<propfirst> rice needs to trademark that dance
it's so heartbreaking to be a fan  no excuses or blame to put on anyone but ourselves  at least true ravens fans can keep their heads up knowing we played a great game against a great team and we're not bandwagon fans  i'm sticking true with my team and can't wait for next year  oh btw any steelers fans that grew up in maryland     fuck you!
5 hours to make a giant snow dick         completely worth it
two words steelers fans: suck it
