surviving the school year of '10
life is like a nut you can't crack   
"senior tag status: <propfemale>    that was fun, they should have another one during the summer "
"germany    week 1 is now complete  have a better idea on what to do these next two weeks \ps  everything in germany is smaller    and the computer keyboard is odd "
just the other day i went wakeboarding in germany    face planted into the water 5 times before finally staying up  until i face planted again about 5 minutes later  all i have to say    missioned accomplished 
paintballing    taste like ear wax  hopefully snowboarding will taste better 
paintball    taste like ear wax  snowboarding should taste better today 
"i just got from berlin today    so many cool things   so i check internet when i get back and i find out something    there may have been a manga convention going on, and on a different note it was freaking hot "
so    today is my last day here in germany  i know for sure that a certain person will be glad that iÂ´m coming back  <propfirst> your going to have to get use to this 
in a london airport waiting is long but not as long the final leg of this trip
"guess who's back! that's right i've returned from germany, and i'm glad to be back baby  but now i'll need to get ready for <propfirst>'s arrival "
i picked up on a crack crazy idea    and it's totally legal  jumpstyle dancing    i will try to master this mad skillz dance 
so the sad truth is upon me now    tomorrow i will be leaving for the infamous corp hell week and i will lose my hair    literally  so if you have any final words for my hair go ahead and say them 
well today we opened the gates and walked    tomorrow hell gives it to us 
"this fish feels like shit!\had myself a good cry a few minutes ago    upperclassman helped me out and e playful lained it all  arms are sore, but beside that i should be fine  their just breaking us down to build us up  i hate to admit it but i miss you guys "
"note to self    purchase the following items   \sore throat medicine, advil, icehot, more granola bars and more time \i could really use more time    the aches are just getting worse "
"-<propfemale> company    fall out!\devil rays we've got guts!\we're not afraid to nut to butt!\eeeeeeehhhhhhhh!"
"<propfemale> company sheild is finished    two letters    b   a   \finally was able to wash some clothes    still need to do whites but will do that when i get back from salt camp \final words    maroon head   better known as sunburn "
"i have returned from salt camp    need to finish laundry and puttin stuff away  anyways salt camp was except it was hot    so this thursday is 'club night' where we get to see all the local clubs and organization, at salt we learned and cool dance and i'm goin to bust a move when the song comes on    oh and join a few clubs while i'm at it  p s  talked to a cute girl at salt camp, i feel accomplished "
finished my first two classes    lawhon is a freaking awesome teacher to have    one of the best comedians there is  college life isn't that bad right now    a lot more relaxed than a set day to day schedule like in high school 
cadet's log 002: finished eating breakfast and recorded intake    checking howdy to make sure i don't make a mistake on finding my classrooms  today should be good at least thats the idea 
so i here sitting with <propmale> b  having a chat while we wait for political science to start 
"so i just realized right now that i am officially going to be hating thursdays right    3 hours of ship maintenace without a <propmale> to get lunch, my friend i do - i do declare that this bites really bad "
the midnight yell was pretty good   
guess who's back in town   thats right    this guy   
returning to galveston sometime later today    and straight back into the business of things    school during labor day    seriously what
"well it started raining now    how depressing and not to mention really cold when walking into a building, freakin chills you like crazy"
"the uniforms a little hard to work with, but i'll figure it out evenutally   "
"this weekend is going to be a pain in the butt for me    white shoe polish, iron steamer, haircut    have no idea what else there is to get beside a game that had reserved earlier, i seriously hope its still there or else a certain person's head is going to roll, but only after he pays me $60 for the lost "
"all i have to say is that thank goodness <propmale> is driving today, because eye need a much need rest from the contacts too much "
well this morning was better bad but this afternoon should be better    maybe 
okay so yesterday i was given a compliment for studying during cq when even though we didn't have anyone to keep an eye on us  so today i should get some stuff for the uniform and i maybe okay afterward
so the day of reckoning is almost upon me    thursday i have watch on the ship from 8 to midnight and finally on saturday i march in at <propfirst> field    man this is going to be a pain 
on the way back to galveston my care blew    no correction shred it's back right tire    someone must really be out there to get me    anyways changing my tire with <propmale>'s help  i thought i was going to be late for study hour and get chewed out for it but by some saving grace i made it 5 <propfemale>  before    seriously what just happened here?
"gone with wind for at least an hour, then later captured and throw into the hole    story of my life right now    its just great "
it's raining and pouring    great way to start the day   
weekend is finally here and i'm still missin stuff for the room    *sigh* time to go back into town   
"phantom of the opera you've just been reaped by the repo man \repo the genetic opera, is freaking amazing    so dark, so satire, so beautiful \why can't all opera's be this amazing? i didn't love <propfemale> vega as <propfirst> from spy kids but now i love her as the ill shilo, and <propfemale> brightman is definately a beautiful singer i was sad when sh   e hit those <propfemale> gates    hard "
a bit of a flu and losing my voice    it seem so weird not being able to talk like i normally do  i hate it when my voice cracks at key points 
"well last night i checked the weather channel website and it saying it was going to be <propfemale> all this week    and i thought oh great hot weather, but this morning it was chilly and i thought oh great chills with a <propmale> of warmth "
so weather is starting to cool down    i'm not sure if i should be happy or not 
so the weather is dropping now but it still not there yet    just really chilly mostly because of the wind though 
"chilly just a wee bit, but nothing big to say that is of great concern "
"well this day is going to bite pretty hard, two exams for the day    what more can i guy ask for? oh wait, i'm going to need a haircut for inspection tommorrow, freaking tastic  i could get a $8 haircut easy but guess what    no cash  out freaking standing, this day couldn't get any better "
so tomorrow at 0400 to 0700 i'll be on watch and then later in the afternoon i'll be mirroring the morning again  this would be mean i'd be late coming home but who cares after this i have no watch for the rest of the month 
"sentry's log 0400-0700, nothing of great importants happen besides the usual  standing watch, protecting the cape gibson from the ball-ping pirates and most importantly keeping an eye out for my arch-enemy    wait is that?    *gasp* squirrel! you're mine!!"
"history is cancelled today so must mean only one thing    mr  lawhon is going to be a grandfather of twins  congrats to him, and good luck to his daughter "
so this weekend we have our last march-in for the year    and we have to be at the quads before 0845    seriously    what the heck?
"outstanding march-in    not so outstanding game    not really a shocker but who cares  kind-of wish it could've been better again, but whatever what's done is done  i'm still proud to be loudest and proudest member of the fightin' texas aggies' class of '14!! eh!"
"not exactly sure what to do this morning    eye is still stinging but it should go away eventually  with no formation this morning it was pretty good waking up at my own time, even though i did wake up at 0630, i was just lying in bed enjoying the moment  well whatever there may or may not be history today but that will have to be seen "
twic card here i come and hello +2 on the final <propfemale> grade  not really much else i can say but that my printer just isn't working with me right now so those chapter 7 notes i typed for poli  sci  have been for nothing seeing as i can't print    *sigh*
"can anyone really e playful lain why politicians are so idiotic, and not just politicians but people in general    not really something i should be bothering with but i've been reading a conflict between <propfemale> and japan, and it all started with a fishing boat   "
i think i'll rub the anchor for luck seeing as i have a test in business math today  man i really going to hate this test for sure   
"so everything for my schedule was a little amissed but it wasn't hard to fix    anyways long story short, class is canceled today, and now i can take care of some other business   "
so i find out that my polis test that would be on wed  is not happening    yes!
today may be a bad day to go fly a kite    very <propfemale> out there   
"midnight yell was fun    so now the plan for tommorow is to take of my lab then grab my stuff and try to get up to college station  on a different note, the ever lovely first lady of aggieland is taking resident on the second floor of abatross    in short, she is on my floor  oh yeah    and then there's oh no    with the way my company acts i knew we were going to look bad in front of her "
"we win our football game, we went to go see a red a very good movie, so now we'll be goin a little bar hoppin'"
"heads up: anybody who wants to talk to me today or the next few days here on facebook should not bother    if you want a reason, go bug the living crap out of my parents   "
"it rained, it poured, it blew, it gust and guess what? it sucked    but on a different note, the forecast that it should just be <propfemale> tommorrow    well that's going to blow   "
iama-be    staying in galveston this weekend and taking care of personal business   
feels like a good morning    except during formation there was mosquitoe about as long as both of my thumb nails end to end    i that was pretty weird   
the zombie v  human game begins tonight at 00 surprise 0    good luck to the four members of <propfemale> and everyone else    may the game lord have mercy on our game souls   
day one    i survived the first day    little nervous but that was to be e playful ected with someone who can't stand watching something really scary    anyways    day two is just on the horizon and bullets are going to fly    god speed to the survivors 
"so i forgot to say this but i had to get my number moved to a different phone  to get to the point, i just need people to send me a text just saying that this is your and and be sure to include your name "
