"mom got to come home today  she still has to keep up \her breathing excercises to get her lung inflated properly  we got her \home and gave her medicine to her and she went to sleep for a bit  she \is doing well and just needs to keep resting "
"mom had chest x-ray yesterday and blood work and they told her that the lung is still not inflating like they would like but it is improving  grandma is doing well, she is doing a little bit more walking around the house  i rescheduled my ankle appt for next week, so not sure what i will be looking at in that aspect yet  thank-you all for your thoughts and prayers, they are greatly appreciated "
