enjoying time w the family today
trying to get to the taste of buffalo this weekend   bastards scheduled me for the weekend again   
i've come to the conclusion that sometimes rather than reaching out to those we don't understand perhaps we should just duct tape them to a train headed for a brick wall 
homework is giving me a headache    ouch :-9
"looking for a new job, something related to i t  in some way    i'd be elated to land a tech support position let alone anything higher up "
trying to get in touch with old friends and acquaintances from high school and itt
getting really sick of people who would rather burn bridges than accept that they were wrong 
"loving this storm, though the lightning is too far beyond the horizon to get any good shots  sad "
finishing up my homework and prepping for my final exams next week
got so much work to do    getting nervous now   just quit smoking and it's not helping   
trying to get my schedule worked out for next semester so i can call my new employer and get my schedule worked out there   this is a nightmare *_* so yeah on that note i picked up a better job making better money from a chair rather than doing a crazy amount of work for <propfemale> wage at ihop 
just finished up my exams   glad to be done with school; gonna enjoy my week long vacation by starting at my new job  laugh 
thinking about setting a date with <propfemale>    want to give everyone that wants to attend time to set aside a day but we're pretty well ready to roll  smile 
training for my job is going well   i've taken a couple of tests and gone over an obscene amount of material in the past couple days    tomorrow is the last written test that i'm aware of and from there out it's all practical hands-on stuff  smile 
sorry if it seems like i'm getting out of touch; i'm working 6 days a week now and school is starting next week taking up a total of 26 hours of additional time in my week    i'm pretty loaded down -_-
"<propfemale>'s coming home today   makes going to work so much nicer, knowing that i get to see her later on "
"grandma grande's b-day party was today, had a lot of fun chillin w the family    laugh "
"quit my job so i could do my schoolwork, just getting caught up now    way too much trying to hold down that schedule  looking for a part time gig now   if anyone knows of any openings for a <propmale> network admin or a help desk position give me a shout  smile "
wow    i got called back in??? odd  umm  awkward  apparently i'm still looking for a job but currently employed  laugh 
wow i feel sick    f****** flu season  sad 
i'm trying to install a new os on a 64-bit machine that shipped with windows 7    i'd prefer a linux distro which will host vmware; i need to run a domain controller on that box as it's the only machine i have access to with the specs to support a network  any comments or suggestions from the peanut gallery would be really useful right about now -_-
"wow what an exciting life    the highlight of my day was coming home and flipping out because my laptop wasn't working    taking all the modules off, cleaning everything and reassembling it    only to realize it was an id 10t error; my power supply, buried under a pile of laundry, became detached between the wall and the unit iself    pos    (subsequently cleaned floor)"
"caught up in 2 3 classes, carrying an a in both; i need to catch up in math though   god willing some of the material will sink in this week or i'm gonna be sailing a sinking vessel "
"hiring managers look at three things when reviewing candidates for i t  positions: e playful erience, education and certifications   given my work history and grades thus far i need to start adding alphabet soup to my name    any advice on what certs to focus on?  i have about six months to obtain at least one cert beyond an a+, although i plan on going for that asap "
was enjoying sleeping in    now gotta get up and go to school 
"i did some heavy research and decided on which career path to take after i finish out at itt tech   i plan on going for my cissp, which for me is a hefty exam, and then parading around trying to get a job within a year so i can avoid taking it again -_-"
found a really great set of videos on assembly programming using asm on linux  enjoying this greatly but i need to sleep    need to learn    need to sleep    smoke?
had my interview for school today; i think i did well  smile 
"next time you feel like your life sucks, talk to someone with problems worse than yours and i assure you the combined reality check and feeling of helping another human being will lift your spirits  smile "
wow it's a saturday night and i have absolutely nothing to do    this is depressing 
"well, i've got all day to study for my final    i'll be happy just to pass this class "
"bored    can't wait for this quarter to be over   i'm going to lasertron btw, if anyone's interested   they put out overnight deals oriented towards adults and every thursday there's a 4 hour session for $20 so let me know if you're interested "

"good times, noodle salad "
"never shopping on black friday    ever    again    stood in line for four hours waiting with <propfemale> to buy some pony thing for her niece, which when we finally got around to buying wouldn't fit in the car boxed and had no easy way to open it so i ended up sawing away at the box with keys    ugh "
bored as hell  sad   i need a life outside of school   
first day of teaching done   first day of stressing out over tomorrow; never done 
congrats to all of the graduates at itt tech; you guys earned it 
"well, well, what to say    currently mapping the rest of my course using bloom's taxonomy as a guideline   great tool, but this is taking forever "

"grading papers, looking forward to tomorrow "
"wow   just found an emulator for gameboy games, n64 games, snes nes games    ugh   now how am i supposed to sleep ever?"
"attending school on a night you i'm not scheduled    pure fail   on an up note, though, my home pc now has a functioning copy of windows 7 and my laptop finally came in from work so i can use office 2007 for my lesson plans  laugh "

wow   really good nights make for really sore mornings   
i often wonder to myself what the future of our country looks like   will we be speaking chinese in the next 50 years?  will we revert to a monarchy to remedy our current socialist   aristocratic state?  where can i find other people with similar interests outside of universities?  i want to talk to people about this stuff but i have so much to say i could write a book
