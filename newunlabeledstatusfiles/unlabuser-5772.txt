"the man who hit us while we were outside the vehicle on oct  5th was arrested on friday at 3:20 p m  he bonded out that night, but at least he has been charged  his blood alcohol content was approx  4x over the legal limit  our attorney should be letting us know what happens next  since it's his third dui and he is being charged with felony charges he should be going to prison "
mornin'  i don't know why but i feel like this is going to be a good day and i hope it is for everyone  getting better with the <propmale>  today i'm going to go to wal-mart with <propfemale> and my neice <propfemale>  any trip out is great
