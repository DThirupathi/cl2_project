facebook is becoming crappy  too complicated  i yearn for the simplicity i first joined for 
is pretty sure you are supposed to aim for the cars when playing golf  it's a lot easier to hit off of pavement 
so it wasn't a turning <propfirst>  whatever  the lady didn't have to be that mad  right?
"got off work a little while ago  it took forever to close tonight, yet i am not tired at all "
"lost voice  feels like crap  shearing sheep tomorrow and perhaps baling hay, then work afterward  fml "
tired and thanking god for the day off 
"just woke up from a nap, getting to bet might be a little difficult now "
forgot how much energy it takes to ski  i'm exhausted 
sore all over  work better not be busy tonight 
skiing    because belly flops don't hurt enough when you aren't going 30 mph 
it seems like i never have time to do anything anymore  two more weeks and everything should cool down 
needs motivation 
needs this sheep thing to be over  pronto 
joining a fraternity 
heading to work soon  i smell like sheep  go figure 
"audiobooks, you can do anything while you listen  go for a run, mow the lawn, walk sheep    anything, except read    the irony "
<propmale> potter 6- one thumb up 
wants fair to get here quickly 
"sheep show went great  not as well as last year, but still great  now time to relax and have fun instead of worry "
"is dry  after about 40 water balloons, two buckets and many other miscellaneous wettening items later "
sad that tomorrow is the last day of fair 
"my last fair come and gone  very sad, but it was a pretty great fair "
finally home for a few a little while 
is in a very good mood  i wish i felt like this every day 
has still got it  ran 4 <propmale>  first run since cross country season  no stops  i feel good tired 
"playing cards with the family  nice night in, but the cards seem to hate me tonight "
hasn't gone fourwheeling for a while  looking for something to do tonight 
gonna go weed eat  o boy 
going to a barnstormers game for my dad's birthday 
back home  leave tomorrow for chicago 
in chicago til thursday 
still in chicago  back on thursday  having a pretty good time 
"i don't like hotdogs, but i have to admit the chicago hotdog is pretty good "
"i like traveling, but being home feels good  leave on sunday for college "
off to college today 
"tired, and sore  overall, good time "
has to go sing to a bunch of people i don't know  o boy 
feels like i'm getting it  one step at a time 
i can't figure out why i'm tired  shouldn't be 
needs to run more  tonight felt good 
just spent like 3 5 hours working on design  turns out they were telling the truth when they said it would be a very busy class  o boy!!!!
saved a girl from certain death with <propfirst> 
going to an <propmale> museum  hooray!
is with <propfemale> planning to take over liechtenstien 
"my voice hurts  damn you \yell like hell!\"""""
<propfemale> pong feels sooo good  haven't played in forever 
"cleaned the house, ate brunch, now i have to shower and shave then go work on a design project, then hopefully make it to supper, then yell like hell, then homework, sleep, and a full day of classes tomorrow  o boy!"
sometimes i feel frustrated 
sitting around studying and doing laundry  i feel pretty good 
how hard is it to spell <propfirst>? my name is not brain    jk i'm used to it    for now 
doing laundry and homework  they seem to go hand and hand 
in a good mood  need to go to bed soon  feeling like something big is going to happen this week 
"i think i'll put my homework off til later tonight  it's a bad idea and i will regret it later, but that's still not a good enough reason "
"the hallways are painted, kinda crappily, but painted at least  gonna take a shower then go to bed  i like college life "
"i wish i could have made it back for homecoming, but tonight was probably more fun  i do miss my creston friends tho  lots of love "
such a bad mood and it's all because of the attitudes people have 
"donated blood today  it took forever, stupid    veins  now just studio left for the day and then an open night to enjoy "
so i think lightning just hit in our parking lot  loudest thing ever  i found myself on the floor and there was a huge flash that made everything look like daylight 
i love rainy stay-in-and-relax days 
design 102 project  so stupid 
stuck in the same situation looking for a change 
angry that the new the office episode isn't online yet 
"had a good weekend at home  now, back to college life "
made it on to wednesday for yell like hell!
"i need to get some things done, then i will be able to have a good weekend, hopefully "
so i was planning on having a good night  then i got all sick and stuff  hope tomorrow is better 
sick on homecoming  great 
"still sick, blah "
"making a hammer out of paper  this definitely feels like a college class  actually, it is une playful ectedly hard and i will never make another paper tool ever "
trying to figure out what classes to take next semester  should probably figure out what mojor to do first  one step at a time? nope 
this design program is kicking my butt  i don't think like this  crazy designers 
a pretty decent night  some go your way and some go the other way  i would say that tonight was inbetween  nothing to complain about but nothing to celebrate  i guess we have to be thankful for these nights though  g'night 
has to work on design today  eventually 
"not enjoying working on design, once again "
about to start initiation week  might be out of touch for a while 
a new active member of pi kappa phi 
this week is gonna take forever  i know it 
thanks for the birthday wishes  mucho appreciato 
i wish i could just skip my classes tomorrow and start break early  stupid mandatory classes 
this feels weird  in my pajamas at 10 smile 0 and eating homemade food  being home feels good 
"windows 7, yes sir  only $9, yes sir "
"people in ames keep leaving status updates like \yay snow\"" and stuff and i don't see any snow  quit getting my hopes up """
snow  'nough said 
pretty much a four day weekend  then three days of tests  i'm gonna ignore that last part though 
phones broken 
loaner phone  yep 
its weird  lots of guys are leaving the house and i'm not even halfway done with my finals 
two more finals tomorrow  in tests from 7 smile 0- 12:45  at east i can get it over with 
going to spirit lake to visit my grandma 
back in ames  couple days of getting some stuff in order 
actually looking forward to classes starting on monday  tomorrow should be pretty relaxed 
looking forward to actually getting into this semester  i have a feeling it should be a good one 
looks like i'm gonna be pretty busy this semester 
actually getting a lot done today  success 
it bothers me when people put the emphasis on the wrong parts of sentances 
i wish i could <propmale> in wasting money  i would be very good at that  maybe i should look into something about working with the government 
"its beginning to look a lot like christmas, which is dissapointing because its still like 10 months away "
can't wait for opening ceremonies for the olympics 
watching me some olympic opening cerimony  my favorite part 
and life goes on 
awkward night so far  time to study for test tomorrow 
"the sun is high, we're moving on "
this weekend is going by too fast  unacceptable 
"a good weekend  <propfemale> in wonderland, the arc casino night, a new phone and hoodie, and all the spaghetti i could ever eat "
should probably pack  leaving for texas in about 4 and a half hours 
because even when the pavement ends i'm gonna keep on walking 
kansas state!!
i hate online homework  it is useless 
swam in a swim meet for the first time since 7th grade or so  i    didn't die 
my psych teacher referred to family guy in one of our practice tests  i now dislike him slightly less 
not exactly what i had planned  sadly 
first final tomorrow  alright   
"today i felt like the richest man in the world of college, but then it all went away "
this studying has been surprisingly peaceful  almost relaxing 
finally done with finals  looking forward to the summer  i think it is going to be a good one 
"just bought actual groceries for the first time  like, bread milk and eggs, legit groceries  i feel all grown up and stuff    and hungry "
i don't know why i'm still hungry 
booked my flight to charleston  getting a little more excited now  just a couple more weeks 
"\like\"" this\",601b4b31e09b29c3f1232011d32f1e52,today seemed to fly by 
watching all my old design friends getting accepted into programs and wondering what would have happened if i had stayed in the <propmale> 
being pretty productive for only four hours of sleep  kinda pround of myself 
"i always swore i would never get a twitter account, but now i have to for pi kapp college  my bet is my account lasts for less than a week "
"back home in iowa, but i hope to never forget all of the things i learned and all of the people i met in charleston, south <propfemale>  pi kapp college 2010 "
chatting with the hp support guy online  surprisingly friendly 
pretty great weekend 
i wish i could just have groceries delivered  i hate shopping for food 
i'm such a handyman 
still don't feel like school has started  as of right now i still don't have any homework and have yet to buy any books  am i technically even a student?
just dropped $515 on books    it's a good thing i didn't get to use that money for something fun like skydiving  instead i can enjoy the good company of boring books for four months only to return them for $20  hooray   
today i found out you get a lot of strange stares if you walk around town carrying a watermelon  who would have thought   
<propfirst> kavalier is possibly the coolest man alive!
it takes fedex a week to deliver a package? that's kind of ridiculous  why does my package have to go from wisconsin to kansas? i believe iowa is found somewhere on that route 
curse you homework 
i love having a light homework load this semester! on the bad side    most of my classes are heavily exam weighted 
i guess not everybody can be logical   
i should really go to sleep soon  saturday seems like it might be pretty busy 
is employed  hooray!
busy busy busy weekend  which is a good sign 
really should have put aside more time to do everything i have to tonight  my bad 
tired  just watched twenty minutes of <propmale> potter before i realized it was on the spanish channel 
thank you everyone for the birthday wishes! they are very appreciated 
"in less than 12 hours, i will be done with finals  i cannot e playful ress the excitement that i feel when i think of this idea "
"sometimes, life is just plain exhausting "
"sometimes its good to just let things go and just go along with the flow  life takes you to a lot of interesting places and some of the most valuable moments aren't listed in your itinerary  the good times and the bad times, as long as it gives you a story to tell "
i'm so happy i actually have a job i enjoy now  kinda helps to want to go to work every day 
getting ready for a 17 hour drive  i love road trips!
why do i have to spend an hour researching something when i could make up my own perfectly good facts?
one speech and three tests this week  might as well be finals week
