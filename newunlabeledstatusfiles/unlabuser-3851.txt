"i went to tn and i had a little fun, but was really bored "
a thousand deaths wont  one life can mean more then another   it depends upon the person   i wish it was a lie 
to many hours to wait for another time and date  crying always never clear what the moment will reveal 
though the world is never clear  i shall always stand and fight the fear  i'm ever enduring the pain of the day to day life we have
"alone is just a word, i'm afraid that i i'm to gone to now   the pain the probably goes with it "
i've changed myself a bit   see if you notice next time you see me
"the world shall never take me alive, i shall not allow my own darkness to take me down no matter what happens "
