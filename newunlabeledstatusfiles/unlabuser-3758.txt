well  i made a facebook  because <propmale> practically forced me into it 
it's almost funny to see people 'liking' things on facebook that are negative 
i've never been more confused before in my entire life 
it's about time i got to sleep  today was the longest day of my life 
i have this feeling today's going to be very    busy 
"well   as i thought, the day was eventful  hanging out with <propmale> portsman tonight    who knows what tomorrow holds, hmm?"
i wish things weren't so damn confusing these days  i thought i knew who i was 
"i can truthfully say, i'm glad this day is over  staying over at <propmale> portsman's house    hope i can sleep "
i was told today that i act like a pet rather than a partner around <propmale> portsman  i disagree 
"i'm so tired, but i can't get to sleep  this is the first night in a few that i've actually been alone in my apartment "
"finally, a day that wasn't insane for once  probably because i avoided <propmale> portsman for most of it    i don't think i can face him "
"ugh   i'm so tired  i didn't sleep well at all  *sigh, rubs at eyes*"
    i feel more happy right now than i've been for the past    i don't know  the past year 
hungry for some noodles  taking <propfirst> out tonight to get some    today has been an amazing day so far 
what a day  i'm exhausted   it's about time for me to hit the hay 
"    it feels a little weird to be awake when he`s asleep, but    i sort of like watching him    *sigh, blushes slightly*"
damn it   i thought things would get better  now i'm even more confused 
"from the hospital with topaz, to my apartment with <propmale>    i really hope things turn out alright "
things are looking up and settling down   i just need to learn how to control myself better 
"much better now that things are official  there are still huge steps to take in the relationship, but i'm finally happy  i hope everyone else is, too "
"i was so nervous tonight, but    it was   amazing  *blush, sideglance* then i came to check on things, and found  --\*shaky sigh, holds his head* damnit "
i'm so tired   work is insane lately  i barely have time to spend with <propmale> portsman   but i do spend most of my free time around him 
topaz <propfemale> is staying with me until she can get her own place   which means she's not going to oregon  i'm glad i influenced her to do so 
"darkness stirs, and wakes imagination  silently, the senses abandon their defenses   *sigh, smiles a bit, dreamily  *"
"i'm so exhausted  <propmale> finally passed out   i'm going between watching him sleep and   checking in on topaz   i wishi could sleep, but i'm almost afraid to "
"damnit  god-fucking-damnit  everything is complicated  everything is confusing  i hate this  i honestly   *grips his gun, staring down at it, eyes glazing over*     "
nnn   i'm surprised it was so easy  all that's left is some paperwork and an appointment at the headquarters    *sighs deeply* now i'm left with other difficult things to deal with    like this stain on my hat 
"everything's over, hopefully  i can relax, now   *sighs deeply*"
"i'm   so exhausted   *passes out, hat over eyes*"
"what the hell goes on in the prosecutor's office  ? *blinkblink, blush*"
"in oregon with topaz <propfemale>, <propmale> portsman, and cann <propfirst> "
perfect timing  i hope i'll be able to focus today   
"i'm glad yesterday is over, but today is probably going to be just as bad  maybe even worse   "
how am i so tired  ?
good thing i have plenty of back-up hats  mine seem to have a habit of disappearing or being spirited away by other people's heads   
"finally, back in los <propfemale>  i can say that i'm glad to  oregon didn't exactly suit my fancy   i don't think i'll ever be flying in a plane again if i can help it  *sigh*\   i also   was able to finally tell my mother about <propmale> portsman    she approves, which is a huge relief  my mother is the world to me   "
watching <propmale> portsman  play soccer   it's amusing 
working hard today  i want to get a raise so i can afford something nice   *blushes slightly*
(( yo sup it's a rare ooc post  yeah so '<propfemale> i'm <propmale> and i'm sexy and yeah   love  the end ))
"thanks a lot, <propmale> portsman  i'm really sore, now    *sighs heavily, rubs back of neck, groaning in pain*"
"i have <propmale> portsman over for a korean dinner, with my mom  "
"ahh, <propfirst> almost destroyed <propmale> portsman's soccer ball  it was an    interesting    sound that i heard <propmale> make when he walked in and saw <propfirst> with the ball in his mouth  he needs some training    or <propmale> won't have any balls left "
"friday nights are always the best  i went out drinking with , <propfirst> meekins, <propmale> <propfirst>, and <propmale> portsman   it was so much fun  hahaha  ~ *flushed cheeks*"
aaaaagh   hangover  *groans*
"i'm getting tired of all this confusion  i want to give up sometimes, but   i have someone who keeps me going, and a few good friends  it's just   i don't even know what's going on anymore, it seems   "
"getting ready for the vacation to vancouver, with <propmale> portsman   i can't wait to get away "
"well   my vacation is soon  i get the feeling that i tag <propmale> portsman too much, but i can't help it   i'm excited  just a few more hours  "
in vancouver with <propmale>   we just arrived at the hotel  it was a long drive  we stopped in oregon and stayed there for the night   *yawns slightly* but i think a nap sounds nice 
"about to go on a date   i'm so nervous  i feel so strange without a hat, but none of mine that i brought would match this suit   *blushes deeply* <propmale> portsman is really excited for it, though  he looks   really nice  ~"
"the date was, of course, amazing   love  i need to go to sleep, now, though   i'm exhausted  goodnight everyone!!"
"just enjoyed a brilliant nap  now, <propmale> portsman and i are out to go sight-seeing around vancouver   i love having time away,"
"i can't sleep   nightmares are keeping me up  i   go through my life, seeing all these cases, these dead bodies and murderers, all of this pain and suffering   it wouldn't bother me so much if i wasn't dreaming that i was the victim  *cringe, sideglance  *"
"<propmale> and i are up early tomorrow to head out   we should be back in l a  before 11 at night if all goes as planned  i'm excited to see everyone i missed, but the vacation was worth it  ~"
about to switch shifts with <propmale> portsman    he looks ready to pass out at the wheel  *smile* we'll be home in three hours!!
"home    i missed it  *tired smile* i'll go visit everyone later    now, i'm going to sleep  <propmale> says to say goodnight  ~"
"well, i'm awake now   haha  *smile* it's good to be back   i'm not too excited for work tomorrow, but it won't be too terrible "
"likes to watch <propmale> sleep  he was picking on me earlier about smoking   *sigh, slight smile* i'm just nervous  work tomorrow today, as well as the birthday of one of the most important people in my life  she's in england right now, though, and will be for a while  i'm not sure what to do with her gift   "
"   i been thinkin', i'd like to see your eyes, open up real wide   the minute that they see me  if you don't come through, i wouldn't wait for you   i understand that everyone goes disappearing   into the greater gray, it covers over every day, it hovers in the distance, in the distance -- in the distance   *sighs, slight smile* counting crows is pretty good ~"
i should go to sleep  i need to work tomorrow    *sideglance*
"even if i'm having struggles, i need to be strong for my friends  i have no right to bring anyone down  *smiles a bit*"
"<propmale> portsman    i love you  you can make me smile, no matter how i feel   i really appreciate all that you've done for me  but now    it's time for a nap  so many things have happened today, and topaz <propfemale> should be arriving tonight  thanks, everyone   i don't know where i'd be right now if you weren't so kind "
"work has been keeping me so busy -- i'm sorry, everyone   but i've been really happy  most of my time, both at my job and at home, is being spent with <propmale> portsman    he keeps me smiling  life is good  "
spending so much time with <propmale> portsman makes me feel like nothing could ever go wrong   i love him  so much   love 
"oh, jeez   <propmale> portsman's starting to take shots  *chuckles*"
"i feel bad, not being on as often as i used to be  i guess life has been busy, especially with <propmale> and i    *blushes deeply*"
    this movie is pretty creepy   <propmale> sure picked a winner  *shudder*
"<propmale> portsman    when you smile at me, you know exactly what you do   love "
"i had been in a terrific mood after spending the halloween weekend with <propmale> portsman    then, i go on facebook to find slander on my wall  *scoffs slightly, lowering hat over eyes*    "
"<propmale> is up to something, i can tell   i just don't know if it's good or bad  *thoughtful pout*"
sorry about the long absense   <propmale> portsman and i forgot about our facebooks for a bit  i guess we were too distracted with each other      ;
"nnn, today was   a hard day to get through  i'm not feeling so good, i think i caught a cold   and a stomachache  *frowns, holding tummy* ;;"
"after a long hiatus from work and facebook, <propmale> portsman has deemed me healthy enough to walk around and type  ;; how has everyone been?"
christmas <propfemale>   and <propmale> portsman  is passed out in bed   love  i guess i'm <propfemale> tonight? *chuckles*
"ahh   i've been so busy  i feel bad for neglecting facebook, but <propmale> portsman and i have so much work to do, it's unbelievable "
so much work   it's good to be busy though  even if <propmale> tends to sleep on his desk while i get his work done for him 
    *sigh*
putting the finishing touches on <propmale>' <propfirst>'s day gift   i hope he'll like it
