"ok, so with my last status report about my epic, i had the pleasure in writing 4 mini poems, but that's only half way of the rest of my epic  i'm stumped on my 5th poem, which i will post on here too, but i need a bit of help with it, my mind can't think of anything  so after i finish that poem, i need to write 3 more, and that will end my epic "
"getting ready to go to my yoga class, my mommy is going to take me"

"found a cpl sites for creative writing that i'm going to join, maybe i can look into publishers that might like my work with the exception of my controversial and offensive ones cause i know those will be very hard to get published, but oh well, if i can just get my epic and my love poems published, i'll be happy nonetheless"
"i'm going to create my own poetry site, that should be a lot of fun, i don't think anyone has to join, just more or less read my poetry and rate it  i'll get started on that in a couple days, or a month after i finish the last 3 poems for homework "

"also, she told me when i got there that she was going to hire me anyway, so that made me feel really good, and she said that i keep impressing her, so i only hope that i keep on doing that, and making her happy, then i can be promoted to working on the floor  for now she's going to have me do stock, that's why i only work for the 3 days, but it's a lot better than nothing "
"so happy that my mom can take me to my job, <propfemale> will be happy to spend time with her too, so it's all gd"
"on writing com and i was searching for poems about self injury and i have to say i found one writer that is compelling to me  her story and issues are baffling to me, i mean why she hasn't committed suicide for things she's gone through is inspiring but she cuts because of those things  ppl say that ppl who cut do it for attention, never thinking about us who do it for mental reasons, and hide it, suffer in silence"
