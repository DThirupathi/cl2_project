"a heartless creature is a loveless creature, and a loveless creature is a beast  to be a beast is perhaps bearable, although the man who has become one will surely pay hell's own price in the end, but what if you should gain your object? what if you should, heartless, actually storm the dark tower and win it? if there is naught but darkness in your heart, what could you do except degenerate from beast to monster?"
