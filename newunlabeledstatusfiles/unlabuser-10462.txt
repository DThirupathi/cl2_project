"soooo nice out!!!!!!!!! i wanna go outside but idk if i will be able to  i have to do social studies, math, and spanish  i might also start on my english who knows  i wanna try and ride my new bike today too  and sadly i must clean my room  bleh  i don't think i will get on again tonight    "
"i am soooo doomed! i cleaned my entire room and i still have not managed to find my <propmale> project so i either left it on the bus, dropped it somewhere between my bus stop and my house, or it's somewhere in my house and i just haven't found it  either way i am sooo doomed!"
"okay i haven't been on in a while  so yeah i found my <propmale> project and so i wasn't doomed  um, haning out at the house today  i don't know if i am going skating or not yet "
