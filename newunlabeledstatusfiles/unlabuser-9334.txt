missing my dezzie!
some say the end is near  followed by meteor showers and tidal waves
i still miss my dezie baby
=[  heart-broken 
hearts racing really fast  so confused  this is some fukd up shit
"i look into the midnight sky, i dream and wish that i could fly, i would come to your aid and take you away, from all the evil and wicked ways, for you my love will never change , i breath the night air and look to sky,  i know you see the same stars as i, your mind is more beautiful than the most exotic creature your physic is so grand that it makes me speachless"
shadows cannot hold hands
i metal my self to sleep while the thorns make me bleed  i sleep with a riddled bed of glass just to hope that it will cut me fast
my brains need to come outa my head
i wanna be left alone but i dont wanna be alone
pagan <propfemale> burns thru my blood in traverse effects of gold light i rise towards the sacred being of the so called kingdom of the ________
ne escape no escape no escape
hahaha there was no heart to break in the first place
fuk
sometimes im ashamed to be human
looking for anyone with musical talent and plays death metal!!!! damn i miss my band in nashville
scattered remains shattered brains
on th ground lies an angel with skin so pale and on her face an image of pain
