"i'm\ strong willed, independent, and outspoken, i make mistakes, i am \sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't \handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best  if \you're a handful then post this on your status   i dare you!"
"its hard not to worry bout someone u love especially when u have no way of knowing the the actual truth, and when everyone lies to u its not easy knowing what to believe and what not to believe anymore   "

finally got all my stuff moved into my dads woot!!! its been a while since ive been on here lol
im glad i have supportive people in my life that love me    cuz sometimes u really need support when selfish people ruin the lives of people around them including the ones that cant fend for themselves  seems to keep reoccurring over generations  its times like these you find out who your true family is 
"it really hurts when someone you love turns into a completely different person and causes chaos and hurt to everyone around them and doesn't give a damn about anyone but their self  i just want the real them back    not the deceiving, lying, selfish person they are now  how can someone change so much for the worst in such a short period of time? it hurts so bad   "
"well i won't back down, no i won't back down\you can stand me up at the gates of hell\\but i won't back down\\gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around\and i'll keep this world from draggin' me down\gonna stand my ground and i won't back down"
"when you feel your life ain't worth living\you've got to stand up and\take a look around you then look way up to the sky \and when your deepest thoughts are broken,\keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die \\ love "
i'm starting to wonder if all my <propfemale> with u is ever gonna pay off  guess i should have never e playful ected it to 
happy halloween!!! arrrrr matey lol
"poverty stole your <propfemale> shoes\it didn't steal your laughter\and heartache came to visit me\but i knew it wasn't ever after\\we'll fight, not out of spite\for someone must stand up for what's right\'cause where there's a man who has no voice\there ours shall go singing\\my hands are small i know\but they're not yours, they are my own\but they're not yours, they are my own\i am never broken"
i hate it when i have too much shit goin through my head

"special needs kids aren't sick or gross  they only want what we all want, to beaccepted  is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour? it is special education week, and this is in honorof all children made in a unique way"
"the things i do \i go through \and all i say \when im away \and what i make \the shit that i take \is something you all ready, all ready know \\i can't live without \all i think about \all i want is you \you're all i dream about \i can't live without \all i want is you"
"i hope things go well with the cutco thing    had my first day of training today  a lot of people have told me its bs but maybe ill have a knack for it who knows  i mean some people have made a lot of money doing it so i figure trying it and seeing where it gets me cant hurt, might as well take the opportunity  you gotta take risks in life, cuz if you dont than you'll never know what might have been "
"so i was wondering if anyone would be interested in letting me show them my demo for cutco, for the next two days i have to show to people who own a house, married and 30 or older  but starting next week i can show to anyone who is 25 and working full time  i get payed just to show it, so no one should feel pressure to buy anything  i need some practice so if anyone is willing to help me out, thatd be great!"
yay i finally get to see my baby!!!!!!!!!  smile   smile   smile   smile   smile   smile   smile   smile   smile  lol
"so again, anyone interested in letting me do a demo for them for my cutco thing? i get paid to show it so anyone who is willing to just watch would be soooooooo helpful!  smile  if intersted in helping me out send me a message and well work somethin out "
the love of your life is the person who makes you forget what all your standards and preconceived notions about love and romance even were  love 
"you must take personal responsibility  you cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself  that is something you are in charge of "
"all changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another "
great now i dont have anything to do for thanksgiving    dont you fuckin hate it when you make plans and turn everyone elses down n then they back out? fucking nice  guess its just me n my dog for thanksgiving

"love is like a friendship caught on fire   in the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering   as love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable   ~bruce <propfirst>"
i find it odd when your trying to be nice to someone and theyre nice at first and then they start acting like they hate you lol thats what i call two-faced    jus sayin lol
"when rules are constantly changing, and your e playful ected to be more than you can be with the limitations you have, it's hard to rise to the occasion  no one should be e playful ected to be perfect  someone who was never taught how to grow up might need help, especially when someone wasnt fully there all their life anyway  my spirit is already down enough i dont need someone breaking it down even more "
too early ugghhhh lol
"i'm all registered for classes in january, got all my financial aid stuff done, and now have a part time job  its under the table but its money lol yay!!!!  smile  thank god things are looking up in that part of my life now if they only would look up for the other part    god i just miss who she used to be    tears me apart "
"dead <propfemale> shine, light up the sky\i'm all out of breath, my walls are closing in\days go by, give me a sign\come back to the end, the shepherd of the damned\\i can feel you falling away\no longer the lost, no longer the same\and i can see you <propfemale>ting to break\i'll keep you alive if you show me the way\forever and ever the scars will remain"
shorty signin off  smile 
"my hands are small i know\but they're not yours, they are my own\but they're not yours, they are my own\i am never broken"
"i know you'll come back someday\on a bed of nails iâ€™ll wait\iâ€™m praying that you donâ€™t burn out\or fade away\all we are\is all so far\ you're falling back to me\you're a <propfemale> that i can see\i know you're out there\somewhere out there\you're falling out of reach\defying gravity\i know you're out there\somewhere out there"
