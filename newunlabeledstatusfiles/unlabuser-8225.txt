i had no problems today
"so im a champ\\i could survive 45 seconds in a ring with a pissed off <propmale> <propmale>"
personally i was overcome with joy that we had completed our adventure  our new found motivation carried us the rest of the way home  i am now at peace with my weekend 
"with pain, low morale, and no more food and very little water we thought our journey to be at an end  with one last push we decided to advance just a little more  god had seen this and admired our bravery  he rewarded us with clear skies and a welcoming breeze "
i almost died today  god had shown many signs to say our quest was not to be completed  we ignored them  he sent his lighting to rain fire from the heavens  we were not fazed  stinging acid rain poured down  we were slowed but trudged on 
your welcome for my greatly true story
today ended with a celebration  lights and e playful losions were involved 
my tale is now avaliable world wide for no more than $19 95
wow my family sucks to be around

i love people who refuse to wait to tell you a story even though your on the phone
offically a memember of the flat earth society
"apparently <propfirst> evans loves dragon force, disturbed, and hollywood undead!!!!!!!!!!! does anybody else feel like disowning him?"
so <propfirst> evans and i are now lumberjacks  indecision 
so im building a raft
"down to your soul - right away, great captain  \\new favorite song"

ive been told many times today that my hair is great  i would have to agree 
ugh boring day  text me 
uuughhh i have to go to lowes tommorow for a few saws and an unnecessary amount of rope for the raft  annoyed 
so i ignored my warning about not eating anything with green apple soda  never again 
so ive got a great movie to watch this weekend
ugh greatest dream ever 
wow i watched a great movie  its over and now im of course theres nothing to do but leave
ive been inspired
"so on todays adventure i found some very odd, used, and out of place items"
i cant stand people that only help to get something better for themselves!!!
0why live a perfect life filled with nothing but your own self centered complaints and misery  when everything around you couldnt be better you still tend
0 to find the worst in things 
the person that complains of being miserable simply has no <propfemale> to be happy 
people better ready for some akward hellos tommorow
"\surely all americans have the right to give their money only to those causes which they support  but what kind of society has this created? a society where the ignorant reign  a society where enlightened must hold their tongues  a nation whose politicians must profess half-hearted devotion to an ancient fable or face the disastrous consequences of speaking their true mind \"" <propfirst> mccandless"""
this guy has changed my view on life 
"sooooooooooo fantastic mr  fox \\one of the funniest movies this guy has seen "
if you get a random text  its from me
"you are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships  god's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can e playful erience  people just need to change the way they look at things  -\<propfirst> mccandless (a hero)"
so im enjoying making akward conversations today
chillin with <propfirst> evans  i love this guy
"so i have been forced to apple bees to listen to my mom complain about me, the birthday dinner were having for her and its her idea  fun night "
somebody might have to die!

"today belongs to a true hero, a champion, a life long friend   \\my hair\with a majestic roar, a beautiful show of power, and the will to surrivive my hair has foughten off invaders, demonic blades from hell, and satans persuasion  even though they flee from this brutal defeat, me and my mane know they will return for another glorious battle of the ages "
well after this enchanting war i am battle torn and tired i must recooperate for when hells gates open yet again

"there is a pleasure in the pathless woods;   there is a rapture on the lonely shore;   there is society, where none intrudes,   by the deep sea, and music in its roar;   i love not man the less, but nature more      \\- lord <propmale>"

adventure!!!!!!!! tommorow if im lucky  hopefully we come back with some battle scars 
"apparently    i need to start looking for a career  adventures, and fun are for children  my childish games need to stop now \\pshhh  tommorows adventure is happening "
just picked up a pig!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the lack of adventure right now is killing me 
i read somewhere how important it is in lifenot necessarily to be strong    but to feel strong  to measure yourself at least once 
so im getting an accordion 
discovered sooooooooooooo many new things today  im proud of myself 
oh man!!!!! i had the most intense dream that could involve slipping on a wet floor at burger <propmale> 
im home  thank god i wasnt attacked by that rabid kangaroo that is destroying the neighborhood   indecision 
aslan is sooooooooooooo beautiful 
"this rabid kangaroo took out a tree at the front of the neighborhood  a small child is one thing, but a tree is where you cross the line  im gonna need the whole clan for this one  we cant let this go on "
almost got lost in the creepest place today  thank god we found a trail that looped back to the road 
wow  fb is really annoying 
i need $110 b| time to start looking for work 
changing my language to pirate has made everything more intense 
facebook official  someone is creepin on me 
babysit? oh yeah 
"no when\no want\no worry"
why does facebook will post random things for me all the time?
bad news  my spies have informed me that <propmale> plans to attack <propfemale> estates from the sea 
i think the biggest accomplishment i've had in the last few days was beating minesweeper on e playful ert 
soooooooo disapointed
the stories of today will be so great 
we are not to be defeated!!!!
my body is refuses to cooperate with me right now 
so  it snowed a bit 
oh man! got the coolest stuff that goodwill had to offer 
oh yeah -___-
so my day was spent in a tree with <propfirst> evans trying to the fend off a pack of unknown beast on the the afirican plains 
so im getting a sailors cap
"i return to you bruised, bloody, and tired  we took a powerful blow to our hearts and souls today  from <propfemale> to dusk we charged this foul demon, but each time we were flung back with a shocking blast of force  the battle was lost as the sun fell, we accepted our losses and retreated to the safty of our <propfemale> city  tommorow though, is a new  day, and a new battle "
"sailor caps? yes \next step is to find a sea worthy vessel"
no school for this man tommorow
its official  imma a cap'n :{d
i read somewhere    how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong    but to feel strong 
i just remembered how much i love <propmale> hull
i guess im starting personal fittness online today
the greatest find ever!!!!!!!
i love how the best adventures are never planned 
"has anybody heard of \texiy\""? i suspect that its an old milk brand """
"wants people to comment on this status about how you met me  but, i want you to lie  that's right  just make stuff up  after you comment, copy this to your status so i can do the same "
goin to spicy browns!
so we just emptied out half a trailer to get to a microphone that wasnt there 
forgot to mention we broke into the trailer 
oh yeah  home just where i want be  annoyed 
"so were cold, lost, bare foot, not so hungry, and we think were being hunted by a creepy dude "
the most awkward ending to an adventure yet
so my feet are bleeding
and brave heros set off for the unknown 
yuuuupp
just wrote up mr  driver    yeah? whats up?
got a tomahawk
-__________-
back to being a solo adventurer? i guess so 
mr  centipede is great
so my parents think <propfirst> evans and i get drunk in the woods every <propmale> we get 
"so i guess i dont have school in the morning, honestly im a little scared"
let the 34 hour no sleep extravaganza begin!!!!!!
"captains log: \the starts just as any other night  quiet and lonely   "
?ntrol of me from the inside   
"?captains log annoyed ive gained a friend, and an enemy  my new friend is a small black beatle, he goes by the name <propfirst>  my enemy is disease, a virus taking co"
"captains log: \i have overcome the disease! the worst part of the night is over, <propfirst> and i eagerly await morning "
"captains log annoyed <propfirst> is dead "
the final strech of the challenge is the worse! i might cry 
mission accomplished

what an eye opener  thanks for that  now i dont even know who my friends are anymore   
is anybody going to the track meet tommorow? at 3ish? til 7ish?
another confusing morning   
sat around the house with shai chavez today    walking my dogs was really awkward but everything turned out alright! :{d
and so the journey begins    
listening to manchester orchestra drifting down the highway   
just stumbled into the tool headquaters
?Â«so he enters this hellhole alone facing judgemental glances and crude remarks  even the group stares cannot deter him  he held strong until the foul wide
?Â« mouth beast froze his very soul with its constant and terrible scream!
i have been invited into a random group of hippies at this hotel  we have been here 10 minutes and i already made friends

why would you continue to come to my house even after i tell you how horrible i think you are?
i really want to know what that embarrassing photo of spongebob at the christmas party looks like 
a powerpoint presentation  for personal fitness  a class that is offered to students online  a class that has no meaning  it is completely pointless 
you have a mini computer smaller than your hand  stop complaining about it 
oh yeah getting yelled at  again  my phones gone so yeah  you can text all you want but ya know  its been an hour and a half  not sure what to do 
if there was ever a time to leave i think it would be pretty soon    
maybe even now
"there is a pleasure in the pathless woods;   there is a rapture on the lonely shore;   there is society, where none intrudes,   by the deep sea, and music in its roar;   i love not man the less, but nature more      - lord <propmale>"
"i swear, i swear i'll go    lead me into my home    don't stop, don't ever go   i swear you'll never know "
