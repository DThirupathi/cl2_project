i really don't want to take comp tomarrow but at least it means im closer to coming home
finally home on leave!
finally almost done with prototype and tomarrow is day last
going to the <propmale> <propmale> after i graduate
has decided to relearn to play the piano 
"yes both board and an e5 exam on thrusday, just what i always wanted"
i passed my board   im qualified for now!
random road trip to florida success
needs to pack and fill out paperwork but really doesnt want to
it makes me feel good to know that i can pack what took the back of my dads suv into 4 boxes
i am sick of packing but it just means that i am closer to coming home!
i will be heading home tomarrow!!
"guess what i am home people, anyone what to do something?"
finally fully checked in!  now to figure out how to get onto the ship and qualify is task number 2
i don't know why but ever since i started staying in huntington hall i have felt sick and tonight i finally started to spew   things had better turn around quick
"found an oyester place, now just need to find a barbeque joint to also become a regular at "
got a new security badge and a piss test hooya
gotta love people who fuck up my <propfemale> cause they shoot themselves in the foot
"found a place that serves gator tail, but it is really hard to find places to eat here   yet any turn i make i run into a shopping mall"
first day actually on the ship and i get duty tomarrow on a saturday and no qual standard so i can't even make progress just my luck
well first day of duty sucked yesterday and i can't seem to get it together today
"didn't get points today, stuck on duty tomarrow   the remedy is to find a good barbaque joint and eat"
hopes he doesn't get in trouble for not  formally mustering cause he was relieved from watch later than everyone else
excited for a 3 day weekend
it must be nice to be a shipyard worker
just got through with golf and i think this is the first time i have actually browned since i was born
all duty days suck but this one did so much more than normal lol
feeling good on a slow going sunday
is going out tonight and might have a not so good tomarrow morning
it seems that the answer to problems with qualification is to add more unrelated training and yelling into the already time strained day   i swear these people need to get the pulitzer prize 
two great concerts done in two days!!  southern voice and carnival of madness tours made my week even if i had saturday duty 
gonna get plastered today
"well missed church again due to a certain douche bag, can't wait to get out of bneq"
has an entire weekend to kick it
maybe getting out of the barracks! things may start getting better
