"regular play ends in a 1-1 tie after a late attack by ghana   now we're into overtime!  keep up the energy, usa!"
"aaaghhhh!  seriously, do we have to give up a goal to start playing real soccer every time play stops?!"

is this big ten country?  no?  then why the $#&% am i  watching wisconsin-msu instead of texas-oklahoma?  wtf?
"first it's wisconsin-michigan state instead of the red river $#%&ing shootout, now we're blessed with washington-usc instead of stanford-oregon?  so a #9-#4 matchup isn't worth showing us?  really?  seriously, is it dish or just being in the southeast that's screwing up my saturday?"

"ugh--first a weekend-long toothache, now i've got the flu or something  i just want to feel well again "
yet another championship <propfirst> <propmale> wouldn't have won without the <propmale>  five straight--that record needs an asterisk or something to separate it from everything pre-<propmale>
