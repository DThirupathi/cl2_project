"to simply be mature is not possible for there are many ways you can be mature  physically , mentally, spirituality, and emotionally  so just because you â€œwalk awayâ€� does not really mean that youâ€™re mature but that you choose not to work out the situation  you canâ€™t â€œclose the doorâ€� in everybodyâ€™s face and hope the problem goes away  if thatâ€™s your mentality, reconsider having children "
