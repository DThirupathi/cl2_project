listening to vivaldi while reading about stravinsky's rite of spring creates quite a pleasurable oxymoron!
"â€œa real tradition is not the relic of a past irretrievably gone; it is a living force that animates and informs the presentâ€¦far from implying the repetition of what has been, tradition presupposed the reality of what enduresâ€¦tradition ensures the continuity of creationâ€¦a renewal is fruitful only when it goes hand in hand with tradition â€� ~igor stravinsky"

"just watched charade after a very long day, and it was so good that it actually turned my day from \long and arduous\"" to great!"""
