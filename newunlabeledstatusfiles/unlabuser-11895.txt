learning a new language   or trying to anyways   joyful  i'm finding myself to be a less than adequate teacher  makes me appreciate the teachers who have actually been able to shove the knowledge i have into my brain  thanks!  joyful 
thanks guys  joyful 
thanks for all the birthday wishes  you made my birthday that much better   joyful 
wondering about the state of my life and the things that are happening  are people the way they say they are or are they pretending to get something they want? is my sanity firmly attached to reality or am i pretending to myself? dammit all to hell for not being clear to my addled brain! (insert crazed grin here)
