on the verge of somethin' great 
"i'm a nobody, but nobody's fool!!"
"stimulate my heart, surrender my mind  look into my eyes, and forever you'll find  a bad boy turned good, how could it be true? and all through my pain, how could it be you?"
"water and ice, wind and rain  are the substances i need, to heal your pain "
i'm   bill  the master of my own illusionary world 
â€œi am simply myself  no more and no less  all i really want is to be free â€�
"eating ice cream and talkin' to my brother  right now, nothin' is sweeter than this!"
"i'll shed blood, before i shed tears  shedding tears is a surrender of the body to the heart  it is only proof, that we as human beings, don't know what to do with our hearts "
"i fought alot of drama this week, and defeated it  even though tha battle was won, feel like i'm tha one who lost it  i spent too much energy on it, and honestly im exhausted "
"i do not believe that i am now dreaming, but i cannot prove that i am not  i am, however, quite certain that i am having certain e playful eriences, whether they be those of a dream or those of waking life "
my tears are the showers that fertilize this world 
"the bullet that will kill me someday, is not yet cast "
"my friendship is like peeing your pants: everyone can see it, but only you can feel its warmth "
"i look up to the stars, for they are the street lights of eternity "
freedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time 
"this journey will be difficult  the road will be long, and yet i face this challenge with profound humility with full knowledge of my own limitations  although i face it with limitless faith in my own abilities, i hope to see my friends & loved ones at the end of my story "
"some of the greatest philosophers of our time say that too much sanity is madness; and it may be true  although, i think the maddest thing of all    is to see life as it is and not as it should be!"
"as long as my mind is enslaved, my body will never be free  psychological freedom, a firm sense of self-esteem, is the most powerful weapon against the long night of physical slavery "
