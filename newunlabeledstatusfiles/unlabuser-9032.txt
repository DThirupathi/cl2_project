got lucky at the casino sunday 
is thinking more than necessary 
there is nothing better than random things to make your day more interesting 
is thinking on what the marching band needs to become better 
sweats with the simplest of tasks and hates it 
"finds dreams very interesting, especially weird ones "
is ready for a nice long nap

today is just one of those days that it is just better to roll over and go back to sleep 
"facebook e playful eriment--if you are reading this, whether we do or don't speak often, please post a comment of your first memory (or close to it) of you and me  when you've finished, post this paragraph on your own status; you'll be surprised what people remember about you  (too fun to pass up!)"
"is wondering if it is normal to be ignored, forgotten, and never told about anything "
is in a mental state of confusion 
had a very interesting dream last night about a cult  you know the kind of cult that it would be a bad idea to drink the punch  very     weird      
"wants to break out in a song and dance, just becasue he can     well capable "
finally have a profile picture  it is a little older but not by much  this was in 2006 
is wondering how you can tell if you've gone temporarily insane 
is tired of always being out of the loop 
random things!!!
may have become more insane recently 
is just trying to survive 
needs to stop dreaming up strange things  this time it involved a sate wide game of hide & seek 
had two nightmare last night  never before has there been two nightmares in one night let alone a week 
"is spending a fun filled, mind numbing night day (can't tell here) at area 51  loads of fun    if you can stand it "
loves those midnight walks on the trail 
has white noise (random thoughts) constantly going inside head  can't seem to figure out a way to shut it off 
is wondering if anyone else overthinks everything that crosses their path?
"is wondering what happens if you wander off the path that you wish to travel? would it be better if you continue off the path, try to find the path again, or make a new path to follow  and if one is to decide this, how can it be known if it is the right decision?"
finds that following one's instincts will lead one to place they could never imagine 
"is just finishing up another book  sojourn, book 3 of the dark elf trilogy by r a  <propmale>  good book, good series, good author  can't wait to start one of his other series "
does not like this time of year 
<propmale> insanity  yay!!!
is still just survivng 
hello everybody!
just wanted to say hello everybody  how's everyone doing?
feels much colder  might be because of the lack of hair  luckily still have the facial hair to prevent completely freezing  of course it looks kinda funny 
just wanted to say hello everybody
is awake because he took a nap earlier  dreamland here i come 
"is glad to be back on after about 2 weeks  has nothing going on but is somehow busy? makes no sense, but then again nothing ever does "
something random!!!!!

thinks that he thinks too much      ????
"just found, at a yardsale, the complete blueprints to the enterprise for <propfemale> trek next generation!!!!!"

insanity is in the eye of the beholder 
"my cat is curled up in a ball, sleeping in a box "
coffee break!!!! oh sweet nectar of life 
once again forgot what sleep was 
loves how it is raining right now  absolutely soothing 
had a dream earlier this morning that it was going to storm  don't know where or why that dream came to be  strange 
"realizing an aspect of your personality that you have always hated has disappeared, been overcome, or just might not ever truly existed is an interesting and powerful e playful erience "
"all time greatest quote: \i think    i'm thinking \"""""
is looking forward to a less cluttered good night's rest 
remember to use random wisely 
is wtf considered a state of mind?
beauty is in the eyes of the beholder  (mainly because they are good at making statues)
can't cook to save his life  always an epic fail 
"has the sense that he should be doing something  but, doesn't know what  maybe something is going to happen     ?"
absolutely loves other peoples' (that he doesn't even know) drama so much that it makes him sick  why must they drag your day down with them?
who knows me best? full name  age  birthday  eye color  best friend  favorite color  nickname?? copy this to your <propfemale> & see who knows you!!
"can't remember what he was supposed to forget  oh well, wasn't important anyway "
is best served with a side order of insanity and a large coke 
thinks that people always worried about wasting time shouldn't be allowed to sleep 
"would like to say thanks to all those that laugh at him and his shenanigens  it shows that he is doing it right, and that he is fulfilling a grand purpose "
change is change no matter what it is  sometimes it can be controlled and sometimes it can not 
kes to talk in the third-person  makes him feel very important and powerful  plus he can flatter himself and if nobody knows who he is they think that it is true 
wonders what?
has a sense that more change is on the way  where is it coming from? where is it going? when will it stop? the answers may never come or they may already be here      
mmmmmm!!! chuckwagon donut!!!!
"has always wanted to put this down      \this one time at band camp         \"""""

"this should be interesting to get comments on    \leave a one word comment that you think best describes me using the third letter of your first name    then copy & paste this & post on your wall so i can leave a word about you!"
amazing how working hard for so long on something can be completely destroyed in a matter of seconds 
time to dream what normal people dream  fish
"should just keep his big, fat mouth shut "
is wondering if next weekend will turn out like this one     probably     
"has the sense that nobody is listening, especially himself "
amazing how someone can just get you down so easily  and then they don't let up at all 
what is wisdom? how does one go about gaining it? what does one do with said wisdom?
"is now reading \a case of need\"" by <propfirst> crichton writing as <propmale> hudson """
being more open with people has developed into a wonderful feeling 
feels like it's going to be one of those nights 
sane to crazy in -3 seconds

has a really big sense that something is going to happen happening  don't know if it's something new or a continuation that earlier incidents of similar sensations are finally coming into being  damn this mind for being so vague  guess just need to sit back and pay attention to all the sense and find out 
senses a lot of confusion  must be time for whatever's suppose to happen  or it might very well be sickness from the cold tube ride down the river 
"is done reading a case of need, now on to sphere "

is finding it easier to tell people what's up with his life 
"is finished with sphere, and is now reading the great train robbery, both of which are by <propfirst> chrichton "
"i think that the change i've been sensing for a while now has either happened, or is currently happening  i feel barriers breaking, doors opening, and obstacles disintegrating  a strength inside myself i never knew existed is gushing outward, and now i must harness this power and use to make further change  now is the time that i have been waiting patiently for  i am my only limit  i must always remember that "
