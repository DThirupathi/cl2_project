way too much coffee + way too little sleep = stomach evacuation 
"i am the twilit <propfemale>, beautiful to behold, but beware the deadly thorns hidden by the dark "
"just when you think life is starting to go pretty good, it pulls out a broom and sweeps you back under the rug "
"when the lights go out, and you are snug in your bed, she will come to your dreams "

i break myself to dethrone my soul
