"you know  there's things in life that you just hate doing, no matter what  yet people consistently ask it of you, despite them knowing that you don't like doing that  even when you try to tell them you don't like doing those things, all they do afterwards is complain and urge you on, and you feel forced in the end for doing that one thing you hate, because they're your friends and demanded it of you "
"i cannot believe what happened on <propmale> rumble  edge hasn't been around in forever, so he just comes out at number thirty and wins the rumble? ffff  if he turns face, i'll be pissed off  then again, i guess it doesn't matter since he's just going to lose at wrestlemania anyway  |:"
