"new year rolls around and we all talk about positive change whether it's finacial, political, spiritual, social, personal, etc  this year i plan to put my ego aside and receive my full blessings "
"just wanted to say good afternoon to all my friends, family, and associates on this here facebook network  and also to say go ravens-im partial to the ravens defense  and i hope them cowboys lose tonight!"
ok so yesterday i put my foot in my mouth by hating on the cowboys  they did win but don't e playful ect any miracles people  i was right though with rooting for the ravens(defense)  they destroyed the patriots  i don't know about you all but i'm glad that <propmale> <propmale> and the pats are out of the playoffs  we will have to wait and see if good ole' <propfirst> favre can cool off them 'boys next week

"gregory(urban dictionary):wierd, not uncool dude  into everything, sports academics, etc  not sure of himself or what he wants to do  other people have trouble understanding him because he doesn't undertsand himself  he sometimes gets depressed and down on himself if the smallest thing goes wrong  very pessimistic and cynical, which sometimes almost leads to depression "
my soul is hungry for knowledge  i feel trapped hammering on a glass ceiling because of my past failures  now the fun starts  i see the fork in the road but i'm a trailblazer so i create my own path  politics as usual 
there is a huge difference between hearing and listening  same goes with liking and loving 
tell me how come when you wash your hands with a situation things always turn for the better  but when you put thought and effort into something is seems like things just don't come out right? why is that? today i conceded total defeat but still came out victorious-i was shocked! i guess you do prepare for the worse 
they say you are right where god intended for you to be                           so why does it feel like i'm lost! i guess i'll just keep on p u s h ing harder!
if fear is pain leaving the body-then what is pleasure relating to the body? a question from a hungry soul
"god, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things which should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other  living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time, accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,"
"when you come out your mouth sideways, e playful ect for someone something to straighten your face "
"be happy in life daily but do not become complacent, full, or content  push yourself to limits for beyond failure and situations not seen begin to come into focus  friends, cronies, associates, passerbys, and maybe even relatives tend to jump ship when your path becomes to treacherous for their liking  in the end there is always two sets of footprints in the sand  have a blessed and beautiful day "
"it's so easy to talk about others problems, vices, hiccups, past transgressions, etc  but what happens when you skin your face to the white meat and have to face the music  i guess that's when you see exactly what type of character you have  it's easy to pose when your flaws are not e playful osed "
"too many times we as individuals worry about what others are going to say limiting our growth  sometimes you have to put on blinders in order to see what's right in front of you  this is not to say don't worry about your surroundings, you still need to be extremely self-aware "
i earned my phd in common sense concrete jungle survival tactics from the school of hard knocks!!
"if you think you know me now, wait till iâ€™m in focus, no magic, hocus-pocus, just originality similar to aborigine personalities, minus the formalities and technicalities, trying to make bail but the price steep like high-end oxtails, my thoughts centrifugal yet constantly subliminal  my vocab leaves scabs in the minds of common crabs "
i'm enjoying life with all its une playful ected mishaps and twists of fate fortunes  life offers so many ways to achieve self-gratification besides jacking and jilling(lol)! when you tighten your grip on your vices you can truly begin your maturation process 
"another day, another <propmale> to pray, ask for thanks and forgiveness  good morning to all and may your day be as productive and empowering as mine  be encouraged!"
"surround yourself with wisdom, knowledge, and understanding  when you tighten your circle you cut off excess not needed in your path to righteousness! in the end, it is what it is! its not selfishness, its self-awareness!"

"â€œthere are no secrets to success  it is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure  if it ain't broke, don't fix it' is the slogan of the complacent, the arrogant or the scared  it's an excuse for inaction, a call to non-arms  have a vision  be demanding â€� `colin powell`"
you can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him   ~james d  <propmale>
haters are really undercover motivational speakers=you have to harness the negativity and transform it into potential to power you towards reaching your goals and envisioning your dreams! encouragement 
"you will discover your true character when your faced with adversity, this is the true testament of a man woman! translation=it is easy to shine when the sun is out but what you gonna do when the storm comes, sink or swim, fight or flight! be encouraged-empower yourself to uncharted goals accomplishments "
"the internet is the ultimate platform to broadcast and e playful ress yourself  we are in the age of communication, so use these tools wisely "

"to whom it may concern: please tighten your circle up  life is purposeless when surrounded with complacency and self-contentment  change is enlightening so embrace it  you must break away from comfort to witness potential fuition  in other words=crabs don't want to see other crabs prospering! you have to want better to get it, simple  do you not them, it's not selfish=it's being self-aware! peace "

"sacrifice is all but necessary during times of progression-there are bound to be casualties during reconstruction of one's self  one must weigh the gravity of all facets of life with clarity and sober-mindedness  one must be concrete in times of uncertainty adversity, this is when character is truly evident and forged! don't look back, or you too might turn to salt "
"ok, i think i'm through  i'm too old to be getting wasted, but it happens  i can't remember anything past crashing through those cheap coolers  jl said i went to sleep after that  i probably said some real inappropriate things yesterday, i apologize-i aint sorry for issh! it is what it is  i let my hair down and shaved it all off at the same time  i had a ball  i didn't have any brakes so i crashed!"
"people really underestimate the power of change  subtle signs eventually uncover answers that were seen but rarely utilized  cracks become chasms, thoughts become reality        friends become strangers or worse, adversaries  time to fade to black and phase out of this surreal monotonousness  and so it begins            "
