i hate not being able to sleep  sad   i'll be a zombie tomorrow   anyone have any good suggestions for curing sleeplessness?
getting ready for a long drive home tomorrow  sad 
glad to finally be home and out of that damn car!
dying from the heat  i don't even want to move  blah         
"i really, really hate computers!!  sad "
"whether or not you were a fan of <propfirst> <propmale> or not, his contribution to not only the music buisness but the entertainment industry as a whole can not be denied   whatever his personal flaws, his music was the voice of a generation and for that alone "
is sitting watching a show on spike tv called 1000 ways to die   i can't seem to stop watching    i think its rotted my brain
got to watch some really cool fireworks from the comfort of my bedroom window which was lovely since work has been trying to kill me the last few days
"was looking through old pictures tonight, maybe i'll upload them when i get a day off next week "
"ok if you want to get my attention while i'm at work, take my advice and do not whistle, snap your fingers, or call out across the store \hey you i need help!\""  this will only piss me off and cause me to pretend that i have gone deaf   seriously why do pe"""
"ok so what the hell am doing up at 1:43 am when i have to go to work tomorrow?  it's because i am addicted to google earth   anyone who knows me, knows that i would give anything to go back to the places i used to live (mainly england and germany) but seeing as how i'm not <propmale> enough to buy plane tickets, this program is the next best thing!"
is soooo tired   i really hope i'm not getting sick   being dead tired is usually the first sign of sickness for me  sad 
is listening to the storm going on outside   i never understood people who say that the sould of rain relaxes them and puts them to sleep   if anything it wakes me up and i can't go back to sleep till it stops   thankfully this is florida so i just have to wait 5 minutes and the rain will pass 
can't sleep so i've decided 2 share what's on my mind  today my family got word that my cousin <propmale> was involved in a bombing in afganistan  he's ok but 2 other soldiers w him weren't as lucky  usually i wouldn't use fb as a forum to voice political views but when will enough be enough? how many ppl have to die before we bring our troops home  we've done what we can overthere  let soldiers come home 2 their famillies
i wanted to give an update on <propmale>   <propfirst> heard from him this morning   he is already back on light duty even though he has a killer headache and ringing in his ears   can you believe that? doesn't look like he will get to come home any time soon even though he is still an emotional mess   keep him in your thoughts 
"i just can't seem to find the motivation to start getting ready for work   all i really want to do today is take a nap, read, and <propfemale> with <propfemale> tonight   instead, i get to put up with customers   here's hoping i don't kill anyone "
well i must say that i arrived home in a much better mood than i went in to work with   i spent some time with my fave animal at work (a jenday conure named connor)  he always makes me smile 
is wondering why i have yet to recieve my two year raise when my two year anniversiary was june the 27th   someone in management is going to hear about this tomorrow 
"has been listening to way too much nine ince nails over the past few weeks   no wonder i've been in a pissy, leave me alone mood   oh well, i'll try to be better tomorrow"
had forgotten how much i enjoy the movie practical magic 
"ok so i made an unfortunate discover when cleaning out my purse this morning, my cell phone has run away (though i'm pretty sure i left it in the managers office at work - i hope!)  so if anyone is trying to reach me on the cell, please excuse the fact that i have not replied to ur texts or calls   besides most of u know that i can go for days w o turning on my phone anyway "
what the hell was i thinking when i agreed to work on the one friday i had off in months and months   god i am stupid at times 
"i have a new addiction, this is bad, very very bad"
not looking foward to work tomorrow  i really dislike long shifts and extended e playful osure to less than intelligent customers  if only i could tell them what i was really thinking while they insist on bitching about things i have no control over 
yes!! it is supposed to be in the 60's tonight and only 84 degrees tomorrow   could it be that fall has finally come to flordia?
is just totally discouraged
"went to bed at 11 smile 0 last night with a migrain, woke up at 3 smile 0 this morning, headache gone but i haven't been able to sleep since   oh yeah, this is going to be a wonderful day "
"is loving the weather   its hard to believe that just a few days ago we were in a record breaking heat wave  please, please, please let it last"
"is wishing the cool weather would come back   if ever there was proof of global warming, its here in florida   only a week away from november and its still nearly 90 degrees outside "
"\i went to sleep in my shithole apartment and woke up in an actual shithole \""  great line from a great film   can you name the movie?"""
i love all the horror movies they show on tv during halloween   too bad they usually edit them within an inch of their life 
"i'm all for freedom of speech  i know that not every american is an obama fan and i totally believe that people should speak their minds about the government, its a sign of a healthy society  but some of the things i have seen heard about obama have been down right mean and rude  he may not be a great president but unless your god, you probably shouldn't be passing judgement on him as a person "
"being from a military family, my thoughts and prayers go out to those effected by the shootings at fort hood "
i must admit that once again i'm feeling a little discouraged   things don't seem to want to work out for me but i refuse to give in 
ok i just made the best chicken ceaser salad   very nice after coming home from work 
"is so glad to be home from work finally, really do hate  the late nights"
is getting frustrated with the webstore  don't know how long i will be able to keep it up with the lack of income for it 
"in case, i have never said it: i am thankful for my family and friends who put up with my insanity "
watched the movie love actually last night   watch it this time every year and it still makes me laugh my ass off   got to love the british 
listening to the madgrial from 2000   really makes me miss performing so much 
well the truth of the state of the economy has finally hit me where it hurts - my tattoos   i will have to delay my next one till after the new year 
does anyone from the dbcc choir have a recording of the madgrail dinner from 2002? was there a recording of 2002?
"oh the joys of coming home, getting comfy, and playing silent hill 2 in the dark   life is good  (at the moment anyway, lol)"
so no dill pickles tonight before bed cause last night they gave me some odd dreams that i would rather not dwell on 
"loving to weather, actually wish it was colder  smile  took my mom out for a ride tonight so she could look at houses done up for christmas   there is just something about the glow of christmas lights that gives me that warm comforted feeling   our tree will most likely go up on friday, will post pics if i remember to "
i took my mother to see the nutcracker today at the <propmale> carr performing arts center   it was great and she totally loved it   she wants to go see it again next year 
yay!! i am finally done christmas shopping   now i just have to wrap all the presents tonight cause i don't know if i'll <propfemale>n be able to breathe the next three days   am a little bummed that i have to work till close christmas <propfemale> and that i won't be able to go caroling with my friends but i am greatful for the hours   happy holidays everyone!
really who would have thought there would be so many last minute shoppers at a pet store? and who knew fish were such a popular gift  tomorrow promises to be just as busy but it makes the shift go by faster 
"alright i did my good deed for the day   i went into work on my day off to cover for a coworker who is pregnant and gets the worse morning sickness, or \all-day sickness\"" as she calls it   does anyone have any good tips that i can pass along to her?"""
happy new year everyone! may you have a blessed 2010  (2010 already? god i feel old)
hope everyone is out having fun tonight   i am going to bed early since i have to get up early and i don't function very well on less then 9 hrs sleep   so guten nacht 2010 and guten morgen 2011

"went to the doctor yesterday and its offical, the pain in my jaw is tmj   the doc said it is something easily fixed   however, what he didn't mention is that it will cost more to fixed it than i paid for my first car   maybe i should just live on painkillers for the rest of my life    it would be cheaper "
"a friend at work asked me an extremely important question day   she asked, which are you, team <propfirst> or team <propmale>?  my reply, neither-i'm team <propfirst> <propmale>   she stared at me like i had three heads   funniest thing i've seen in days"

is oddly fascinated by a show on tlc called i didn't know i was pregnant  i'm baffled by the number of women who seem to not realize that they are pregnant  a good example of how out of tune with our bodies we are
this insomnia is a bitch  nothing is helping  just can't seem to shut my head off 
just found out that my step grandfather past away today  i've had all the death i can handle for a week so hopefully no more death
"so i call my job to find out my schedule for the up coming week only to find out that my boss, <propfemale>, has forgotten i exist and has therefore left me off the schedule all week   if i didn't need the money i would enjoy the extra vacation but i do   yet another example of the ineptitude of petco management "

"ok, was told the reason i did not make it into the ucf choir is that i am not a music <propmale> anymore so therefore i didn't make the choir because that would take a seat away from an actual music <propmale>   he basically said that unless i was a music <propmale> or a musical genius, i won't be getting into his chior anytime soon "
