hey            there's an app for that      relax
the pain of a moments time will forever be your forgiveness   
"if we have chosen to live against the grain, then why are we all facing the same way??"
64 beers on the wall 64 bottls of beer    passh them down    uhh i forgot the rest
"if we all have chosen to live against the grain, then why are we all facing the same way???"
"the contingencies, of another day, unraveles my senses"
"we've built our confidence,\on broken dreams now left for dead,\yet we've been condemned,\to <propmale> these dreams that never end   "
"i've had enough of the world\and its people's mindless games \so pardon me while i burn\and rise above the flame \pardon me, pardon me   \i'll never be the same!"
"insanity and abnormality    \careful what you call reality"
"until the 20th century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see, \and hear \since the inital publication of the charged electromagnetic spectrum, humans \learned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear   is less than one \millionth of reality     "
otep is the shit   
do feal lucky? i do!
wondering souls have captured my thoughts    emptyness filled my mind   
"i'm failing\i'm angry\afraid of the ways\they pretend to be us\it's fucked up\i'm different\words remain\my only escape"
 
wondering     
"live is short, blink and you miss it    live everyday like its your last"
"i'm not afraid to bleed, but i will do it for you, a <propfemale> among the hypocrites,the <propfemale> of our time,\so say goodbye to the world,we are the dead that walk the earth\scream your lungs out, await for laughter, you don't have to wait forever, here's the next disaster    "
"with that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me\and all i knew is what had overtaken me \with no reason, i am comforted by inability to understand "
"we are all comatose  we are overfed and under    undernourished, yearning for something more \never starving yet never quite satisfied  carnal but without useful flesh or mind  yeah   "
enjoying my freedom    
"i have traveled so far to find so little meaning in tragedy, or tragedy in the search for the meaning"
"s - son\o - ova\b - bitch\e - everything's\r - real"
these thoughts will <propfemale> me through the darkest nights    
"no more are the days that i will fear for i have found a strength that\none can match and i'll push forward     never has the blood in my veins\flowed so fiercely as when i feel this around me, i am whole   "
"i want, to bring you, all that is in my heart \\i want to give you, my everything  \\but i've failed you  i've failed you so many times  \\how can i stand here? how can i stand here before you? \\when i begin to steal, what only belongs to you  \\i am able to bring you nothing that isn't already yours "

"remove from me this deception, that i called love,        with its gears, that turn to make me feel, and assembled thoughts that fade away"
"hey what would it mean to you?\\to know that it'll\\come back around again    \\hey whatever it means to you,\\know that everything\\moves in circles"

"ive learned in life that you really should hate anyone but idk if thats possible    most people are all the same  98% of the people in the world are selfish, lying hypocrites  hitler might have been a nazi but he had a good idea  kill everyone that wasnt part of the \perfect\"" race   """

funny how you can get a pill to help with certain symptoms but the side effects outweigh the benefits    ironic isnt it?
"my emptiness fills the holes of your predictable questions   \so give me no lectures, don't you sell me your kind   "
