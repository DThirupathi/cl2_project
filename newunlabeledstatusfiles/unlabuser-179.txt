*sigh*  school is tomorrow
time moves on
this world has been connected  tied to the darkness    soon to be completely eclipsed  there is so very much to learn  you understand so little 
one who knows nothing can understand nothing 
darkness conquers all worlds!
behold the endless abyss! within lies the heart of all worlds: kingdom hearts! look as hard as you are able; you'll not find even the smallest glimmer of light  from those dark depths are all hearts born    even yours 
"all worlds begin in darkness, and all so end  the heart is no different  darkness sprouts within it, grows, consumes it  such is its nature  in the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came  you see, darkness is the heart's true essence "
"so, you have come this far and still you understand nothing  every light must fade, every heart return to darkness!"
still confused? then perhaps this will enlighten you!
darkness    witness real power!
it is futile  the keyblade alone cannot seal the door to darkness  kingdom hearts! fill me    with the power of darkness   
yay i got my remmentation letter for attending to high school!
