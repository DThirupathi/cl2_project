<propfemale> is wondering what its all  everything  is all for  does everything really happen for a reason? is there a plan set for us when we are born? hmmm deep thoughts tonight 
it is 4:12am saturday morning and i am half drunk and have not been to bed yet       i dont think anyone wants to know what is on my mind right this minute 
it's now 3:19am friday morning and i have yet to go to bed and am still partying   can't say much of anything is on my mind right now  what a wonderful feeling 
got mad at the boyfriend last night and decided to go for a drive at 12 smile 0am  i ended up in centreville  yes i was quite pissed to drive that far  damn how things have changed since i left there 20 some years ago  it amazing how the eastern shore has grown  next time i will have to go when people are actually awake and meet up with some old friends 
"not ready for christmas  wish it would just go away this year  not ready for snow either  i dont own a snow shovel to shovel my truck out and my 4 wheel drive doesnt work  ah, what an end to an already sucky ass week "
ok the snow is pretty but i am ready for it to go away already  i dont like being trsapped in the house  i dont have any where i need to go but i like knowing i can go if i wanted to 
<propfemale> christ to one and all  have a great holiday 
"to all of my friends that are not my nieghbors in cafe world, farmville, and roller coaster kingdom  please invite me as nieghbors  thank you "

"hope all my friends and family had a great new years  i spent my new years packing  yay, what fun  it was just another day night for me "
i am sooo sick of friggin snow  i wish it would go away and stay away  i am ready for some warm weather 
this damn cold weather is playing hell on my poor old aching body  i have to go out to the store and i am dreading it  i used to love the cold now i just wish it would go away  i am sitting here wrapped in my snuggie and a blanket and still cold  thermostat says its 72 in here  its got to be wrong  my body hurts so bad!!!! come on spring 
"if you & i woke up in jail together   using only four words   what would you say to me? copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say    (and if you make a comment, you gotta put this in your status  fair is fair )"
"3 loads or laundry done and about 3 to go  <propfemale> really shouldnt let the shit pile up  thats a lot of laundry for two people to have  maybe that tells me we have way to many clothes and need to get rid of some  our bedroom closet is over filled and so is the spare room's closet  my dresser is over full also  need to thin out the population some i guess, but that takes energy i dont seem to have "
what was the #1 song on the day you were born? google your birth date and #1 billboard song and then post!
"after all of this snow you would think that i would have went out and bought a snow shovel but nope, not me  luckily i dont have to worry about getting to work and <propfirst> can worry about his damn self (he's a big boy)  i just wait for the snow to melt until i go anywhere  if i have to i can walk two blocks to the store for cigarettes "
"ok, bored with the snow already  cabin fever is setting in and the worst is yet to come  really wish my 4 wheel drive worked  not that i have any where to go but like knowing that i can go if i wish to "
my head hurts just thinking about more snow  my street hasnt been cleared yet from the first round  my boyfriends brother in law has a big 4x4 and is coming over to take me to the drs today and the grocery store before the next round comes  thank god for that cause i am outta diet pepsi and i would just go through withdraw and be a total bitch (more then usual)if i were snowed in again without my soda 
damn i must be really bored  sitting here taking a bunch of dumb quizzes  but there isnt much else to be doing at 6 smile 8am  i really wanna just get in my car and go for a drive but that aint happening so here i sit  damn friggin snow is drivin me insane (more so then normal)  i need to get out

morning it is but how good it is is the question considering i have not been to sleep yet and may be making a trip to the hospital shortly with my boyfriend  but hope everyone elses morning is on the fine and dandy side 
"feels like shit, medications arent helping any, need sleep but cant sleep  sad   got a letter in the mail from dr saying some test results came back badly and they need to put me on more meds  yippy  i am a walking pharmacy now "
ok my sweetie just went to bed so i am going to go try the sleep thing also  wish me luck  i thought my cold was going away but it came back in full force today and i feel like crudddd!!! hopefully a good nights sleep in my sweetie's arms will do me some good  good night all 
"ok, so the sleeping thing didnt work so well last night  i didnt end up falling asleep until 8 am this morning  mr  adorable(dont laugh <propfirst>) and i are off to bed  i hope that i can actually sleep tonight  see ya friday, <propfirst> "
"ok, had enough for one day  my body hurts so bad i just wanna cry  i am gonna go drug myself and pray for sleep  wish me luck  nighty night all  hope your night is better then mine "
severe depression and panic attacks are a deadly combination and i am fighting hard to stay alive 
my cat is getting ready to have babies in the next couple weeks  anyone want a kitten?
cant sleep  stressing  cant shut my mind down 
why does life have to be such a two way street with no street signs telling you which way to go??
god i wish sleep would come and take me away  the pills and the booze doesnt seem to be4 helping like i need it to  my brain is so tired and it justr wont give me any rest  i wish there was just a way to shut it up and make it leave me alone  i have had enough already!!!
well i am home from my 11 day vacation at the looney bin  what an adventure that was i hope and pray i can get the real help i need and nothing like this will ever happen again 
made it through night number 1 in the real world with not to many issues and i am still alive  yay me 
sleep is so hard  when your mind keeps throwing thoughts at you that you really do not want to think about at all  i just want to block out all around me and the world itsself and sleep   i could take some more med but dont know if that is a good idea right now  well lemme try this once again  wish me luck one and all 
"well sleep did finally come a few hours after my last post and then nature called and woke me up  i would have been able to go right back to sleep but someone that decided to stay up till 4:40am \playing\"" online finally decided to come to bed and woke me up completely and now i cant sleep again  yay for me i got about 50 minutes sleep """
sleep is still failing me i got maybe 2 hrs between 7am and noon  i am so tired and feeling very fragile today but nothing i can do about it  feeling lost and confused with no one to talk to about it  please god just knock me out for the rest of the day 
i go to my first out patient psyche appt  in a lil less then 10 hrs  i am nervous as hell but hopefully this will be the beginning to my getting the serious help that i need  i really hope and pray that i can get this stuff worked out and the feelings of wanting death to come take me will be completely gone  i know it will all take time but i am willing to put the effort into it 
i really hate it when i am rudely awaken every morning when someone decides its finally time to crawl up the steps and go to bed  i have sleeping problems as it is and this surely doesnt help matters any  now who knows when or if i will be able to go to sleep again  ggggrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!
the pills arent working  the pain wont go away and they havent knocked me out yet  getting grumpier by the minute  just took another so maybe it will do something for me  uhhggggg!!!!! hate days like today that lead to nights like tonight 
"i need some sleep  i have some things to do tomorrow and dont want to sleep all day or be tired all day  i have been in a shitty mood all day today because my knee is killing me and because i did not sleep for shit last night i am exhausted mentally, emotionally, and physically  i pray that tomorrow will be a better day then today has been  wish me luck my friends "
"i hope i can fall asleep easily and dont get waken up later when the others(john, the 2 dogs, and the cat and her 5 kittens) decide to crawl into bed in the wee hours of the morning i wanna get alot done tomorrow as long as i dont wake up feeling as badly as i did today  i guess we will see how much rest i actually get tonight  hope everyone else is sleeping better then i "
happy father's day to all the dads out there  i hope you had a great day 
if there is anyone out there with the right answers please send them my way because i obviously have all the wrong ones 
"another restless, sleepless night  uhhgggg they suck(and not in a good way)  i went to bed at 10 smile 0 tired as hell and was back up at 11 smile 0 wide awake and restless as hell  i didnt wanna keep mr  handsome awake because he has to get up for work in the morning so i decided to come downstairs and work on getting the laundry done  i am going to go try the sleep thing again  i hope it works this time  nitie nite all "
"depression is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long  put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression  will you do it, and leave it on your status for at least an hour? most people won't, but it's mental health week and    1 in 3 of us will suf   fer, at some point in our lives  show your support for friends who may suffer   god bless"
"non-petowners who visit and like to complain about our pets:1  they live here you don't  2  if you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the furniture  that's why they call it 'fur'-niture  3  i like my pets alot better than i like most people 4  to you, they are animals  to    me, they are young'uns who are short, hairy, walk on all fours and don'tspeak clearly  copy & post if you love your pets"
is anyone on here going to see iron maiden on the 20th? lemme know  i will be there 
how often do men really think about sex?
home from camping and the iron maiden concert  the concert was great  i  dont really feel relaxed though after a couple days away from home enjoying the great outdoors  needed a nap when i got home and while taking a nap i had a dream that has been messing with my head ever since i had it  anyone else ever have a dream that messed with you after you were awake?
"real tears are not those that fall from the eyes and cover the face, but those that fall from the heart and cover the soul "
who needs family   well my immediate family any way  i am done  none of them can keep their fucking mouthes shut about anything  always have to have drama in their lives  leave me out of it!!!!!!!!
when all you have to give someone is your time do you choose to give it to them or your computer?
i need 3 more neighbors on farmville  if you are not my neighbor and would like to be please add me and if you have any friends that would like more neighbors tell them to add me also  thank you very much 
what a time to decide not to drink or get high any longer  damn i sure could use a drink tonight 
i didnt have a very good night last night  my body is hurting so bad and so is my mind  i couldnt sleep at all last night and spent most of the night in the bathroom  i feel a <propmale> migraine coming on right now so i am going to take something for it and lay down for an hour or so and hopefully stop it before it gets to bad  wish me luck with that 
"what do you do when your heart, soul, and brain feel dead but somehow the rest of your body is still alive and moving "
"menstruation, menopause, mental breakdowns    ever noticed how all womens problems begin with men      especially the mental breakdowns"
"found one thing that makes me happy  my poor sweet snake, whom i thought was going to die, and hasnt eaten  in many months(after being attack by a crazy rat), finally ate for his mommy tonight  i actually cried tears of happiness  i am so happy my boner( sorry thats my snakes name) is finally doing better "
just found out one of my male ball pythons isnt a male  i came home after being gone all day to find my sankes doing the wild thing lol  guess boner is a good name for the male  the one that is the female is named bj ( the are a letter b and letter j in her spots) will now become <propfemale> <propfirst>  lets see if i end up with any lil grand snakes outta this coupling  i am excited but nervous 
"protect her, love her, kiss her, hug her, hold her, smile with her, laugh with her  but don't make her fall if you don't plan to catch her "
why dont drs ever listen to you when you try to e playful lain something to them  i think i know my body and my problems a lil better then they do but they just dont listen to me  i think it is time for a new dr  gggrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!
"as of tomorrow i will officially be old  i will be 41 tomorrow  i am excited about what we are doing for my birthday though  we are going too see <propfirst> <propfirst>'s play \madea's big happy family\""  i love madea  she is sooooo funny and i can use some good laughs right now """
thank you everyone for all of the birthday wishes  it makes my heart feels good  it really means alot to me  hugs
trying the quit smoking thing again  i havent had a cigarette since yesterday afternoon early evening  i am not craving one terribly bad right now but i also havent left the house today or seen anyone smoking  wish me luck  i really need to do this 
why cant people see what is right in front of them but swear they see things that dont and never have existed 
i surely picked the wrong time to quit smoking  i am super stressed out and am really wanting a cigarette today  damn my will power is getting tested today    in many situations 
"i am giving up on the no smoking for a couple hours  my will power is best used for other purposes tonight  i need it to keep me outta jail cause i am so ready to go make someone pay for her stupidity  i will go back to not smoking as soon as i can calm myself down, hopefully by the time i wake up "
i haven't slept more then 20 minutes since 9 am friday morning  i am totally exhausted but can not sleep  i can't shut my mind off  my world has been turned upside down and i am just not sure what i am supposed to do from here  i am so lost and scared and i just don't know where to go and how to move forward  the ones you love and trust the most take the most from you and hurt you the most 
why did god make men such clueless critters? are the really that dumb or are they just to damn lazy to use the brain god gave them?
being diabetic with a stupid dr sucks ass  she has me on to much medicine and my sugar is to low very often causing massive headaches and causing me to be very tired and shakey  i have told her its causing low blood sugars but she told me to keep taking it  i guess i will just have to cut it in half myself  i hate when drs dont listen to you 
why cant a man ever just realize he f@#cked up and just say i am sorry  the world would run so much smoother if men werent constantly trying to blame their own misdeeds on someone else 
god please give me the extra strength i need to be able to push forward and get to where i need to be and do what is right for me above all else  amen
has he been lying to me or is he lying to them? not sure i wanna know the answer because either way i have been a huge fool  it's pretty sad 
i really wish that i could run off to a fantasy world when the real world gets to be to real for me but unfortunately i am stuck here   suffering 
"well i have made up my mind  i know what has to be done now  hopefully i will get a decent nights sleep and wake up with not to much pain so i can get some things done tomorrow, well later today  good night all "
i have a massive headache  i think i think to much  been trying to figure things out that absolutely have no possible answer   gggggggggrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!
"i want a drink or to catch a buzz so very badly but i quit drinking back on aug  8,2010  it's kinda messed up when you quit drinking or getting high because of things that someone else said and did when they were totally stoned and drunk off their ass  but things can't be undone now "
"damn, 5:46am and i still cant sleep  this sucks butt holes  need sleep i have things i have to do tomorrow  need someone to tuck me in and tell me a sweet story so that i could go to sleep "
had a very enlightening day  i learned something and tried very hard to forget some things(still working very very hard on that one)  i hope and pray things can somehow continue to improve 
"hey you, standing in the roadalways doing what you're told, can you help me?hey you, out there beyond the wall,breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at alltogether we stand, divided we fall "
having a horrible day  wish things were going as well as they were a few days ago  guess you cant gauge the future by the past 
"what do you do when there are only two choices and neither one seems to be the right one  there doesnt even seem too be one that is less wrong then the other  i'm lost, but whats new  ho hummmmm"
thanks the gods for facebook friends  i made a very special friend on facebook who has helped me out very much in the last week  you know who you are  thank you so much 
finally back among the living after not being able to get online since a certain someone busted my laptop in a drunken fit because i wouldnt pay attention to him
what good is an epiphany if it comes to late to save you from yourself??
"like the song says \ sometimes love just isnt enough\"" which i find rather sad"""
[poke] me if you ever had a crush on me or still do  [like] this status if you think i am a good friend  [message] me if u ever wanted a relationship with me  [comment] on this if we have had good memories  what are they? i dare you to put this as your status 
hope everyone else christmas is going much better then mine 
its sad when you learn the rules 17 months after you start playing the game 
i hate packing and moving  anyone wanna help me?
i so wish that i could go to sleep and stay asleep until this month was over and someone else would handle all awful stuff i have to deal with this month 
why are there so many flipping love songs on the friggin radio??? damn
anyone know a really good mechanic that works really cheap?
the stress on my heart and soul has taken its toll on me  i am numb now  i know longer have the ability to feel anything for anyone  its such a sad situation 
"my panic attacks, that have been very small or inexistent for a while, have come back in full force  i cant sleep, i cant eat, i shake constantly, and just cry uncontrollably  i hate feeling like this, so out of control "
so glad all the moving and most of the unpacking is done  my body has almost recuperated from all the work  i fell down the steps and thought i broke my left hand and wrist but hospital took x rays and said it was just a bad sprain  luckily it is getting better quickly  yay for me 
"need sleep so badly but can tell this is not going to be a good night for me  i so wish there was a switch that i could flip to just turn my mind off  i am so tired of thinking,and feeling, and stressing, and worrying "
"i think i am the only person on this planet talented enough to fall asleep sitting up in bed and fall out of bed, face first, onto the floor  i woke up upside down on the floor  now that is just pure talent   not!!!"
i am going nucking futs with my truck broken down  i hate not being able to disappear when the urge strikes and i really hate having to ask someone to take me somewhere 
actually going to try laying down to go to sleep tonight  falling asleep sitting up at my desk or in bed and ending up on the floor is not as much fun as it once was  i really wish i knew when i was going to fall asleep but cant feel when the sleep meds kick in  i just fall asleep 
this not sleeping shit is really getting old  its messed up when you are so exhausted mind and body but can not sleep even with medications 
"i love getting presents, especially from that special best friend  big smiles  going to try the sleep thing early tonight and praying that it actually works  wish me luck  good night everyone "
