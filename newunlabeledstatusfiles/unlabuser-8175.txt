#728  there truly is no one like you  your beauty that is you is truly unique and i think ur thoughts and emotions run deeper than most  which i think sometimes leaves feeling as though you're alone  i always wanted to just say hey sister you may have your own planet but you aren't alone  haha i think you are groovy!

"#2  well my sister kinda likes u and u don't judge me  u love me unconditionally,  so u got these things going for u  lol  i think u should know that whether people say it, show it or don't  u r loved   more than u know  from me 2 u   life is to be enjoyed   stay positive, be happy & treasure the people in ur life unconditionally  xoxo"
