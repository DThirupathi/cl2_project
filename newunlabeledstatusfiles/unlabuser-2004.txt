when life fills your pants with holes make sure you're wearing pretty undergarments!
"when given the choice between me or someone else i'm usually picked last   it's alright, though, because there needs to be that distinguishment between popular and unpopular, liked and unliked, winner and loser  without the loser, there's no basis fo comparison for the winner  someone has to be the last one chosen and now i've realized i'm ok with it being me   at least i'm picked at all, right?"
