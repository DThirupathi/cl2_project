what the fuck   
last week of this shit   finally
"just got off work  this shit is gonna be tiring, but none of you will recognise me in a couple of months  my supervisor says that he's seen people like me drop 20 pounds in the first two weeks on the load wall "
"counting on me, always hoping i'll be, there for all of your problems in turn you're never there for me   you sucked the life out of me, you hate everything you see, i always stay when i should leave   "
"they think we're all the same\ and always we're to blame\ for shit i think is lame \it's time to stop the game \i think it's time to pay for everything you made me say"
boom boom boom boom
"so   about 500 packages, 6 feet long and 2 5 feet wide, each one weighing 60lbs, in 2 hours  that's 500 x 60, which is 30,000lbs  i am tired   "
leave me alone
they think they've got me all figured out   
people   they're always in my way
wake me up or let me sleep forever
"going to work   lol\donivan's older brother is my trainer, if anyone was wondering ; )\funny stuff man, funny stuff"
"i feel the reason as it's leaving me, no not again   "
"running out of ways to run\i can't see, i can't be\over and over  and under my skin\all this attention is doing me in"
"i felt the hate rise up in me\kneel down and clear the stone of leaves\i wander out where you can't see\inside my shell i wait and bleed"
"but my dreams, they aren't as empty\as my conscience seems to be\i have hours, only lonely\my love is vengeance, that's never free   "
"i can't control my shakes\how the hell did i get here?\something about this so very wrong   \i have to laugh out loud\i wish i didn't like this\is it a dream or a memory   "
"have you ever wondered why, in a dream you can touch a fallen sky, and fly to the heavens that watch over you, telling me it's all voodoo    voodoo too"
haha i has idea! ^ ^
the verdict is guilty!
"no oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me   "
"falling into this place, just giving you a small taste, of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyways"
"such a surreal place to see, so how did this come to be?\arrived too early"
what the fuck    this is going to be a shitty summer to top off a shitty year  great  can't i get one fucking thing to look forward to?
"blacken the cursed sun, you're not the only one, to have sunk so far and low, there is no tomorrow"
haha that helped a lot  feeling much better now gonna play some lol and <propfemale> out w  <propfirst> all night  hopefully work tomorrow will be better
"you can tell the same lie a thousand times, but it never gets anymore true\so close your eyes once more and once more believe that they all still believe in you"
"i wanted you to know, that i love the way you laugh\i wanna hold you high and steal your pain away\because i'm broken, when i'm lonesome\and i don't feel right, when you've gone away"
"so what if you can see,\the darkest side of me,\no one will ever change this animal i have become \help me believe,\it's not the real me,\somebody help me tame this animal i have become "
"my eyes are open wide\by the way   i made it through the day"
going to shooters with some people 
"won 1 game, lost 2\fun night"
my hardest question to answer is why   
"the more the dark consumes me, i pretend that i'm burning bright"
"just to clarify, most of the stuff i post are lyrics to whatever song i happen to be listening to"
"i am all, but what am i?\another number that isn't equal to any of you"
ayyyy yaaahhhhh!
techno sort of mood =_=
"sanctity a breath away    \just a breath away  "
"no one cares about climbing stairs\nothing at the top no more"
ugh so tired   
"haha i know it's far away, but i can't wait for halloween : d"
"someone falls to pieces, sleepin all alone\someone kills the pain   \spinning in the silence, to finally drift away   \someone gets excited, in a chapel yard\catches a bouquet   \another lays a dozen, white roses on a grave   "
"why do you <propmale> it? \what can it bring you? \it canâ€™t be had    \the secret hides in living"
"it makes us worry, and takes our dreams\sometimes it's the enemy, or so it seems"
"you'll never know why your face has haunted me,\my very soul has to bleed this time,\another hole in the wall of my inner defenses,\leaving me breathless, the reason i know,\that i am stricken and can't let you go,\when the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know,\that i am crippled by all that you've done,\into the abyss will i run   "
"tyrant, i'll burn you down"
smile and destroy it
"the city looks so pretty,\do you want to burn it with me?"
"i am stricken\and can't let you go"
"like my status and i'll tell you what i like about you, what i don't like, and my first impression "
fuck it all
"living just isn't hard enough\burn me alive inside\living my life's not hard enough\so take everything away"
i'm bored as hell =_=
"show me how to lie\you're getting better all the time"
"es wohnt in mich, und in dich \es wohnen in uns, in die herzens <propmale> mÃ¤nnern \es ist hassen und wut  und es wird verbrauchen dich "
"open door so i walk inside\close my eyes, find my place to hide\and i shake as i take it in\let the show begin  wink "
"uhm   89 degrees with 90% humidity   \and i got to work   fml"
st  <propfirst> greets with empty eyes then turns and locks the gate
"don't hold me up, now\i can stand my own ground\i don't need you help, now\you will let me down, down, down"
"how about a better version of the way that i am\how about a better version that makes me understand\how about a better version of the way that i am\the way i look, the way i speak\how about a better version of me?"
fallen and falling
what's everyone doing today? hit me up
"i am darkness, i am night\i am vengeance, i bring light\i'm a winter breeze in summer time\the world is broken, i'm just fine\looking day and living night\i'm alright"
there is nothing in the world that can change my mind
"promises have been turned to lies\can't even be honest inside\now i'm running backwards\watching my life wave me goodbye"
"when people are treated like animals their whole lives, they act like animals \when they are not respected, they have no respect for themselves  when they act out, we treat them worse  treat people with respect, show them kindness  in return, those people won't grow up with no self esteem and become druggies, murderers and prostitutes  this is not a hard concept, so why does everyone have trouble with it?"
to truly live you must embrace the things you fear  we think we know so much but we have no idea
they say when it rains it pours   
i don't understand why half of my friends even talk to me =_=
is not looking forward to work
i completely forgot how fucking amazing the show full metal alchemist was  so i'm watching it again 
nature does not care whether you can describe a phenomenon by an equation  it just manifests them 
work tonight  again   lol
fuck it all
"god i'll make them pay,\take it back some day,\i'll end this day,\i'll splatter color on this gray "
"oh damn o o\just discovered immortality lol"
"i wanted you to know, that i love the way you laugh\i want to hold you high and steal your pain away\because i'm broken, when i'm lonesome\and i don't feel right when you've gone away"
i won't let caution or doubt get in my way anymore 
diving down   round and round   
"did i ask too much?\more than a lot \you gave me nothing,\now it's all i've got"
"why does everyone feel like my enemy\don't want any part of depression or darkness\no, i've had enough, sick and tired\bring the sun, or i'm gone\or i'm gone  "
"if your body matches what your eyes can do\you'd probably move right through me on my way to you "
"today has been strange  not bad, not great, just strange "
i'm not pissed off for once  deal with it  laugh 
"well world, what else you gonna toss at me?"
"canada is only there until they do something we don't like\i'd like to see them start a fight someday\we'd probably beat them to the ground by 6 am"
"a sniper takes a life\the doctor saves one\the bum wastes his \same as the <propmale> man\chasing what they do not want\what they didn't need"
"all these thoughts, they make no sense "
running out of ways to run 
"i'm not paralyzed, but i seem to be struck by you "
you always find a way to keep me right here waiting 
"help me i don't know what i'm saying\sometimes this tongue can be betraying\and if i'm wrong, is that such a crime?\and if you want, you can set my words to right"
haha hard to believe it was 90 degrees on monday 
let's all go to work  yay    funnnnn
"no one cares, 'bout climbin stairs\nothing at the top no more "
"i sit here locked inside my head\remembering everything you said\the silence gets us nowhere   \gets us nowhere   way too fast"
school was ok  time to go to work   yay?
anyone have ms  francek for writing for the 21st century? i need the stupid questions 
another day i'll never get back    haha
why does everyone feel like my enemy?
"you know when you feel full of energy all day, then the exhaustion kind of creeps up on you? yea   "
i love caffeine  i can't stop smiling  laugh 
eating some chicken strips   like a boss!
"it's been awhile, since i could hold my head up high   \and it's been awhile, since i've said i'm sorry   "
"if i offer you my soul, will you <propfemale> me away?\i can not be the only one, to be dehumanized again   \left behind "
"i've got some imperfections, \but how can you collect them all\and throw them in my face  "
"well what i really want to say, i can't define"
not sure how i'm supposed to do this <propmale> homework  where do i go to hear the listening stuff?
opinions change   as do people
what the hell happened to me?
i hope this name thing works   i could use a good laugh
slippin into oblivion 
too much caffeine is not good 
"i'm spinning, but in a good way i think "
"scatter with the wind\let instinct be your guide\let go of reason\and just enjoy the ride"
i think   i'm gonna walk
hahaha hahahahahahahhahahahahah aaaahahahahahahah  laugh 
"hollow inside\cracking outside\can you tell a real smile\from my hollow one?\do you even know the difference?"
"i'm not blind\i'm not deaf\is it so hard to believe\i'm telling the truth?"
so i dub thee unforgiven
dammit   
hmm   guess this week is gonna suck  a lot 
buttered toast is just like a candle 
thanks for all your help  you know who you are   and i hope you know i appreciate it 
feeling kind of strange 
"i create another day\you'll be gone tomorrow \lie to me   \you're faceless"
"i stand alone\inside   i\stand alone"
"i could be weak\i could be senseless\you know i could be just \like you"
"it never was enough\and the world is what i gave to you\~black <propfemale> by hollywood undead"
"<propfemale> it with you till someone forgives you, \i laugh cuz' there's nothing to say"
i need to get the hell out of here for awhile 
"label me, that's fine    i'll be somebody else"
"just take a little bit off the top\i don't care, just make it stop!"
hard to speak today   i can think of shit to say just can't seem to make my mouth form the words   guess i'm just that tired 
1;2;3;4;5;6;6;6;
                                     (silence)
ugh      
"the higher you are   the farther you fall   the longer the walk    the farther you crawl    my body, my <propfemale>    this <propfemale> it tilts   step into the house that <propfirst> built"
ugh    so damn tired    
meh   i just don't know right now 
"you're better off empty and blank\the left with a single, pathetic trace of this"
going for a looooong walk
"i can't tell you what it is i can only tell you what it feels like\and right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe "
"this is the face that stones you cold\this is the moment that needs to breathe\these are the claws that scratch these wounds\this is the pain that never leaves\this is the tongue that whips you down\this is the burden of every man\these are the screams that pierce your skin\this is the voice of silence no more"
snap back to reality   
just keep bending 'till i break
"sing with me, sing for the years, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears "
"so you think you can tell\heaven from hell\blue skies from pain\can you tell a green field\from a cold steel rail\a smile from a veil\do you think you can tell"
happy birthday brother 
possibly the greatest picture ever taken 
feel the tension in the air? something is gotta break soon 
hey i just realized why most songs are depressing or angry  because nothing rhymes with happy that isn't stupid 
i'm gonna change what you call rage 
anyone wanna do anything? i'm fucking bored
"for all those looking down at me, fuck you, i'm tearing down your balcony"
"like my status and i'll tell you: \1  something i've learned about you from looking at your wall\2  the color you remind me of\3  my first memory with you\4  the animal you remind me of    \5  ask you something i've always wondered about you\6  my favorite thing about you\7  challenge you to repost this"
"we'll walk this road together, through the storm, whatever weather, cold or warm, just to let you know that you're not alone"
why   
"awesome  let's see   \pain in my legs, head, back, and neck all bordering on horrific\don't even get me started on the pain in my chest"
"<propmale> cobain heh   \hopefully i don't go out like him though"
"don't lose any sleep tonight\i'm sure everything will end up alright"

"the healing hand held back by the deepened nail\follow the god that failed"
rest in peace brother  it's been 2 years today but the memories never fade 
"refuse, resist, war is my <propfemale>\disorder unleashed, war is my <propfemale>"
"come as you are,\as you were,\as i wanted you to be"
bored as fuck anyone tryna kick it?
take a step into my world
kickin it at <propfirst>'s for a bit
haha told you guys the packers were gonna stomp the bears  14-0 at halftime 35-7 is my predicted final score 
watching full metal alchemist: brotherhood all day  so    day successful
"into the abyss of subconscious   away i go haha\goodnight facebook"
"you think this is over? oh no, we've just begun "
"rawr! just got off of work and i'm super energetic for some reason o,o"
"you can't survive in my shoes\or afford to pay my dues"
i must confess that i feel like a monster
"help me i don't know what i'm doing\help me before i fall to ruin\and if i'm blind, i will lead you on\come follow me now, before our time is gone"
drama is so frustrating     
"just like the pied <propfemale> \led rats through the streets\we dance like marionettes\swaying to the symphony of destruction"
boredom
today should be pretty good
"dead i am the one\exterminating son\slipping through the trees\strangling the breeze"
are you ready? no? too bad haha  laugh 
"gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me\to a world devoid of light\to another time and another place\and the broken ones will taste my misery"
"people need to learn to shut there god damn mouths  quit vomiting up whatever happens to be on your mind, i don't fucking care enough to listen anymore "
"hahaha ok eagan, give me a 4 day weekend "
\they say death is beautiful and necessary\,b8ab00202cf1eb9a6187a87dad3d76a9,i'm urban warfare through the streets of your psychology 
universal truth isn't measured in mass appeal

"you take a mortal man\and put him in control\watch him become a god\watch people's heads roll"
