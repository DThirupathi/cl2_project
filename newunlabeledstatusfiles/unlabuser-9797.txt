enjoying my two days off
back at home
"could people from mars hill read my note \hey\""? that would make me feel better   """
"   ever feel so tired that you could just die but your brain says \in your dreams\"" and stays active?"""
feeling rather well right now  smile 
"i am convinced that the five extra commandments that <propmale> dropped contained \thou shalt not have spanish as a language; thou shalt not ever speak of such blasphemy; thou shalt forget all affiliation with the personification of evil; thou shalt speak english this year onward for it must be a universal language; thou shalt be grateful that these commandment tell you to do no spanish \"""""
i can say that i'm pretty happy right now lol
i can say i'm thinking too much
facebook sucks right now
im confused
"ok    just called apple support and they fixed everything, yay!!!!"
i wish i could think of better things to say to people when the moment presents itself and not after
about to head home on fall break! finally lol
i'm kind of happy that i just put two and two together to connect the episcopal church with the church of england lol awesome
just watched an iron maiden concert and am completely pumped up!!!!!!!  laugh 
i am convinced that the bible also states that those who hate math shall not be forced by any means to take it as a class
"oh how the devilry of math and spanish seem ever so close to taking over the world, is anyone going to stop the atrocities? is there a champion that will just say no to these horrendous acts of <propfirst> and influencers?"
does life give flowers or petals?
thanks everybody!!!!

"ah the feeling of boredom, how you haunt me so!"
just saw the match ups for the 2011 rugby world cup!!!! getting very excited!
just suffered my first extremely vivid dream in a very long time =i
"when you <propfemale> the bible, satan gets a headache  when you open it, he collapses  when he sees you reading it, he faints  when he sees you living it, he flees  and just when you're about to re-post this, he'll try to discourage you  copy and re-post if you can    any takers?"
preparing for the big leave
at the hill and hungry
feeling a bit off
