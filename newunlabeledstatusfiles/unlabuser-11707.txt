after working with the clinically insane i've realized nones normal
if you love something let it go if its ment to be yours it will come back to you
training in blue <propfemale>    what a day off   sad 
got saturday off   thank god! !!!
peace in relationships is knowing that you've done everything possiable on your end to reconcile  if they fail its on them 
smelled skunks today while out driving   and the purple flowers my mom loved so much have bloomed!!   today is a good day   smile   love 
i feel like i'm getting arthritis in my hand from using my phone too much   
funny how things always work out for the better after the bad   love 
change only for the better 
shopping spree today   i think so!!  smile 
"some days you may feel completely alone, but that is only by choice "
its nice being able to trust someone other than yourself 
feeling another tattoo 
jealousy is troublesome to others but a torment to themselves 
third shift   playful 
working till 11 then going out 
working outt so my mood isn't so blahhh and to get my ass in shape   playful
