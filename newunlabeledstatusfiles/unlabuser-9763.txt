"so <propmale> <propfirst> finally confirmed what the world knew all along        he's gay  so i guess it's true, all the hot men are gay  wink "
the humane society of tulsa is next to a whataburger  why does this scare me?
"<propfemale> lauper on celebrity apprentice is so childlike, but i absolutely adore her! she's so sweet and i have a new found appreciation for her "
it's offically may! you know what that means? 11 more days til my birthday!  wink 
i got a fraudulent <propmale> banking email that actually had a link to the real <propmale> website to report fraud  is it just me or are phishers getting stupider?

watching legally blonde on tv  they censored the word sperm and replaced it with seed  since when is sperm an inappropriate word?
"with me working in a call center environment, one would think i could be sympathetic and nice when i call my cell phone company  perhaps i get too annoyed when they read off a script? when i ask a yes or no question and get a 3 <propfemale> report, it's a bit annoying for sure "
just saw the trailer for the new karate kid movie  why do i want to vomit at the thought of a ripped 8 year old?
is it just me or does the guy in the 5 hour energy commercial look like he's a gay porn <propfemale>? lol
my dog sure is weird  he loves pita bread! at least he's eatting healthy! lol
"i truly don't understand republicans at times  they speak of smaller government and want the government to stay our of our families' lives, yet they want to deny the glbt community the right to marry someone of the same sex  am i wrong or does this go against what they stand for in those instances? gotta love hypocrites!"
"ugh  abdominal pain is keeping me up  the pain started tuesday, thought it was gallstone pains  today (wednesday, though technically thursday) i called off work thinking i could relieve the gallstone pain  well the pain moved to my lower right abdomen  i sure hope the pain eases up before work  if not, it looks like i'll be missing another day of work and heading to the hospital "

being given a notice of a mandatory bug spray by your apt complex the day before the spray is totally uncool!
"why yes, i am hilarious! thank you for noticing!"
"legalizing gay marriage will lead to legalizing dog marriage  this can be inferred from the history of other political initiatives  for example, when women got the right to vote in 1920, it led to terriers voting in 1925, and when title ix was passed in 1972 to prevent sex discrimination in public schools, resulting in the creation of athletic opportunities for girls, it led to bichon frises on the basketball court "
"ever look back at people you thought were attractive when you were younger and think, \what was i thinking? they have the face of a goblin!\""?"""
"so last night before bed i saw a little bit of <propfirst> kimmel talking about \the bachelorette \"" well apparently i also had missing the <propfirst> <propfirst> concert in chicago in mind as well  these 2 things merged together and you do not want to know what kind of dream i had! lol"""

"goodbye summer,  i'll miss you  see you again in about 9 months, provided that bitch winter doesn't take up all of spring's time again! i wonder if autumn's gonna be cool this year    "
"watching snl on hulu  omg    the most recent episode is hilarious! \gay wedding at the new mosque near ground zero with a pregnancy termination lounge! 'this could happen ' this message  brought to you by the rnc and 70% of the dnc \"" soooooo wrong!"""

learning as400 for my job  sure wish we used it with my last job at alorica  it would have saved so much time and prevented a lot if headaches! i'm sure some if not all that still work there would agree 
"i think champaign urbana is in need of a gay men's chorus  amasong is here, a lesbian chorus  perhaps i can get one started somehow "

"today is spirit day when we honor those who took their life from being bullied for either being or being perceived as gay, lesbian, and transgendered  i too was a victim of bullying and harassment in my teens based on my perceived sexuality (i had not come out at that point in time)  this is surely something that hits home to all those within the glbt community "
just read about the <propmale> mccance thing  that just makes me sick to my stomach! he's certainly not human or christian!

"cnn is projecting <propmale> will win  i sure hope that projection is wrong! 93% have been reported and <propmale> only leads by 2% (82,414 votes)  close races like this are why everyone should get involved and vote! illinois will not be the same if <propmale> actually wins  a republican governor? we're screwed    again "
looks like <propfirst> is back in the lead again  this sure is one tight race!

"nope  i will not do that  i will not copy your post as my own to show support of whatever it is  the vast majority of those weren't for the cause they support, they're to see how rampant their 'chain letter' of sorts can go  i find them very annoying  if i know it's truly to support a cause, i will do it     otherwise, keep your chain to yourself "
