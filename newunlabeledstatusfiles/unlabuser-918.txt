lots to do tonight and all i wanna do is sleep   
"frustration at it's highest      b's first night in the main sanctuary - total disaster - couldn't get her to quit talking (or the other kids for that matter)- crayon <propfirst> on the seat of the pew - multiple trips out for potty, crying, etc  - and to top it all off, she pees her pants and i had no extra clothes - needless to say, i have no clue what the pastor spoke on tonight (the people around me prbly don't either)"
"a lil' bit of braggin on <propfemale>     i told about her winning a $25 gift card for making the best holiday card - what i didn't realize, until yesterday, was that the boys & girls club here in <propmale> chose her card to have printed and use as their holiday cards to their supporters - i got a copy yesterday and <propfemale> will scan it next time i'm over there    needless to say, i'm even more proud than i was   laugh "
"off work today - they're cutting back hours until we get a cold snap and service calls increase so, i'm only working 4 days a week now - i kinda like having a mid-week day off though - quiet house, time to myself (before b is up) aaaahhhhh, refreshing   smile "
"so, how do you deal with a boss who wants to talk to people like they are complete idiots?  i had my first taste of it today   apparently 3 weeks into the job, i'm suppose to remember every single thing every single day without fail or perhaps he should \laminate a timeblock schedule to my desk so i won't forget what needs to be filled\""  ggggrrrrr  do you know what the carlisle in me wanted to do?"""
thinkin bout hittin a couple flea markets tmrw - haven't done that in a while

watching miracle on 34th street (the original) with liv & b - one of my favorite movies      smile 
"thanksgiving:  what is it?  e playful ressing gratitude appreciation  -  how often should we give thanks?  in all circumstance; you don't have to thank god for a trial, but thank god for who he is in the midst of the trial because god is bigger than your circumstance  (jus a small part of this morning's sermon - it was a good one!!)"
happy thanksgiving all y'all

the shepherd never went after the rebellious sheep   the rebellious sheep knows exactly where he is   the shepherd went after the lost sheep   --  read my next post     
"to rebel against something, you have to have knowledge about it   the more we learn about god, the more powerful our spiritual lives become   satan intimidates us into walking away from that knowledge and being \our own person\"" by rebelling against church   rebellion is a false bravado to cover the spirit of intimidation that controls your life """

okay     game 2 and i don't even care to tell the score      our girls had trouble hitting - livi did get a good hit in toward the end of the game and she did an awesome job and showed some good hustle playing at shortstop and pitcher's helper
     desperately trying to stay awake       gotta pick <propmale> up at the bus station at midnight -then i've gotta be at work at 8am   oh yay me!
"wooohooo - we came so close to winning tonight - our girls did awesome!!  score was 11-7 - <propfemale> was 3 for 3 on batting, made a couple good plays at 1st base for outs - tonight was a big difference from game 1"
off work tmrw so i get to have lunch with livi at school - i might even manage to take an afternoon snack to bryleigh's class if i can get enough done in the morning **crossing my fingers**
"where oh where has my motivation gone?  where oh where can it be?  i got laundry to do and a chore list that's long     i need iced coffee from micky d's  \\----must say that has to be about the nerdiest thing i've done in a while    sometimes i jus gotta be a nerd"

"aaahh      slept in today and then laid around in the bed watchin tv and playing with the girls (they're so silly) - i've seen a fashion show, the world's greatest dancer, had a <propmale> invitation (with a huge sweeping bow) to the pizza picnic on bryleigh's bed, a tickle contest and someone offered to share her <propfemale> with me if i'd watch cartoons with her     it's been a wonderful day!!"

bryleigh has made it all day with no accidents - apparently she decided this morning she wanted to wear panties and has just done it      i knew she was gonna jus up and decide she was ready one day - this girl is stubborn -  should we place any guesses on whether this is carlisle or haltom stubborness   smile
