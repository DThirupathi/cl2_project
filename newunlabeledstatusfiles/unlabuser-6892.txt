"the static comes alive\beneath the broken skies\<propfirst> perkins said it right\love is the final fight\\let it rise above\rise above\there is no song\louder than love\\this is the sound of a heartbeat\this is the sound of the discontented mouths\of a haunted nation\we are the voice of breaking down\\can you hear me?\this is the sound of the desperation bound\by our own collision\we are the voice of breaking down"

another reason i hate the navy: giving me the flu every year when i am otherwise perfectly healthy 
"out to sea for a month, on my second to last underway in the navy  thankfully the navy gave me one big one to go out with after this one  if you need me, message me here or at my email "
"i am down to my last year left in the navy, but it seems that the most challenging path has yet been placed in front of me  for this last year i am setting an active goal to be polite, understanding, and patient; values which i have lost since i have enlisted and are part of me that i need to portray  posting this might be slightly self-serving but worth it to those in my life whom might wish to know status about me "

i'll stand through all these lines just to make it make to you 
"your pain is always accurate and striving to evade its only design, it wants to strike you down to fall into its arms again "
