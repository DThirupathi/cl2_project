"\i know you and you know me  one thing i can tell you is you got to be free\"""""

"why do so many people have trouble being honest with themselves just to conform to society's ideals? human nature is human nature after all, why spend so much energy denying it and becoming hypocritical?"

"â€œi believe in the brotherhood of man, all men, but i don't believe in brotherhood with anybody who doesn't want brotherhood with me  i believe in treating people right, but i'm not going to waste my time trying to treat somebody right who doesn't know how to return the treatment â€�"
"â€œwe have no right to ask when a sorrow comes, 'why did this happen to me?' unless we ask the same question for every joy that comes our way â€�"
this is why i will never play matchmaker
