kind of annoyed at the fact that there's no snow on the ground  one good thing is that there's supposed to be a snowstorm tuesday night into wednesday  yay~
"really need to get my hair straightened and cut  i will during break, which is good--my hair's starting to really bug me  >w>;;"
"i'm going to try to work on a paper for one of my lit classes, but i'm probably going to put it off until the last minute like always  laugh "
"freezing, trying to beta a story for a friend, but i'm more focused on warming up  geez, i need to get something hot to warm me up "
"be back in a while, going to go and get something to eat for dinner "
snuggling under the covers  just got something to eat and came back    really cold d=
">w< relaxing time, commence "
"busy day tomorrow, going to watch tv and just chill until i decide to head to bed "
just realized that the paper i had no idea of how i was going to start has to be shorter than i thought it had to be  score! going to try to finish it tonight or get close to finishing it so i can edit it tomorrow 
"it's snowing    a lot  not going to go out much later, wanting to see where all this snow's going to take us  probably going to curl up under the covers and watch it come down "
"liking the fact that even if i do have classes tomorrow, i get out early  >w>"
   i hate the internet here  can't wait to go home!
snow day~
"freezing in my room, so i'm huddled under the covers trying to get warm"
"moody, sore, irritable   the whole package "
"my cell decided that not working would be the best thing  damn it, i like being able to have the thing working, but i can't do a thing until i get it fixed!"
"got my phone fixed, but i'm still not in the best mood"
"busy day tomorrow, trying to read something for a lit class and it's giving me a headache with how blurry the text is "
"crap, i have to get a 5-6 <propfemale> paper finished by wednesday  i don't really feel like doing it, but i have to  d: psychological route, here i come  >w>"
english homework    i'm still procrastinating on my paper too >>;
probably getting sick  don't really feel that well 
not in a good mood at all  trying to find something to distract me and possibly keep me from snapping at someone  not really working that well though    
meh  don't feel really well  the flu sucks 
"aggravated at several things, i'm just glad that my english midterm isn't on the monday that i go back to classes  seriously, its completely crazy how my professor was trying to switch things like that! giving us not even five days to prepare for a midterm that was supposed to be during midterm week in the first place! che, don't get me started on the paper i had to write  pure torture there "
"actually somewhat sleepy, finally going to get some sleep in a bit  but before that, i need to rearrange a lot of the pics in several folders on my laptop!"
"now that i have some <propmale> things under control and fixed for the most part, i'm thinking about transferring to ou in the fall  i just need to have a great finish this semester, and hopefully i can get back to what i really wanted to do, styding to be a nurse! hopefully it'll work out and i'll be going to ou in the fall "
"tired, sick   blah  going to crawl under the covers for a while "
"busy day, going everywhere on campus it seems  after class i'm going to go swimming for a while then head back before the rain starts  taking a soak in the hot tub before i go back to my dorm too   playful "
finally the weekend is here!~
"need to study for my english midterm, work on the take home exam for my french class, then read the rest of <propmale> <propfirst> for my british romanticism class  the rest of the day soulds fun    "
"easy day tomorrow thankfully, but its still going to be busy "
"busy, busy, busy  just want to be watching movies all day, but that has to wait sadly "
procrastinating on my macbeth paper  i have about half of it finished    maybe i'll finish the rest tomorrow? who knows  depends on a lot of things actually  the biggest one is if i actually feel like working on it 
tired    i just need sleep 
 surprise  interesting tidbit  its dry enough in michigan that there's a fire weather watch until 21 surprise 0 on friday  creepy   maybe we'll have a dry spring summer and end up like cali in the really dry years? who knows   
"so much to do  need to finish a paper for a class tomorrow, then another for next week  then i have to study for a french test tomorrow and on top of that i need to finish a composition for my french class too  che, what fun that will be "
last week of regular classes  next week is finals week and i bet i'll be just as busy
"hey, finals week is next week  done with school for the summer on thursday  thank god for that!"
"feeling rather blah  allergies are being a bitch to me, and i'm still pissed about not having that grade for my english 300w class  wth? i need to hear back from oakland too    "
"ugh, horrid day imo  pinched nerves everywhere in my shoulders and i'm not in that great of a mood  i'm reminding myself to take more pictures too   meh  busy week up ahead "
working on several fanfic ideas at the moment  letting my warped mind go to work   wink 
"ohay, new pic finally with the glasses i got in february   let's just say i need a better camera than the one on my cell   laugh "
"rawr  lots of things to do, yet i'm so out of it  figures "
"fucking laptop, its dying at random times    and i still have a hell of a lot i can do "
why is it that i always lose interest in social websites like this? meh  it might be because they grate on my nerves for some reason  never saw why people liked them too much 
"heading to bed, going to enjoy the nice weather by reading outside for a bit later  hopefully it doesn't get too hot   smile "
"it really did get hot outside fast  almost halfway into atlas shrugged, and now its time to work on other things "
still so tired  i might just sleep some more while it rains 
finally woke up enough so that i don't feel like going back to sleep 
"can't wait until wednesday, i want to know if i'm going to be accepted into ou~"
really tired   probably going to pass out for a while
"sweet, its storming outside  pretty <propfemale> too "
"wheee, tomorrow's going to be busy  hopefully it goes well   smile "
"i'll find out later in the week if i'm accepted to ou, and i hope i am~"
in need of sleep  really going to be lazy tomorrow 
"finally heading to bed  if its going to storm, i'm definitely going to be buried under the covers for a while "
"yay, storms are heading through  its going to be horribly hot the rest of the week though "
going to read for a bit before bed  i really want to be able to travel and see both <propfemale> and italy  maybe someday? <propfemale> reve lointain~
"feeling rather blah  its hot outside and there's nothing to do in this damn town  heh, i have time to work on my scholarship applications and my fanfiction though  laugh "
sleep schedule is still fucked up   hopefully it will even out soon
