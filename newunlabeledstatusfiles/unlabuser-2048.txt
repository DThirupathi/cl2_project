"i don't know what to think of this <propfirst> <propfirst> court case ruling and i understand why the evidence given did not support reasonable cause for a guilty verdict  personally, i believe there was a lot more details hidden within this  perhaps the entire family was covering up the murder or someone within the family knows what happened  what a horrible situation!"
