best day ever: a promotion and passing my driver's test with no practice 
"day off = random shopping, tanning, and reading in the park "
off to work  today better be an easy day lol 
is having a issue  even with all that is going on at work and home at the moment; i still have (unfortunately) found time to think about unnecessary things and people from the past that i still haven't let go of  i'm having a big problem finding a way to channel the energy into something else  i'm just getting overwhelmed  this should be interesting 
off to work  i hope it is an uneventful day lol 
a day off from work  i am gonna get some stuff done around the house  and <propfemale> out with some friends 
death to the bmv 
today is a new day and i will not let yesterday bother me anymore  lol
since it's supposed to be 80 degrees today  i might just go down to the lake for a couple hours and <propfirst> out; maybe take some pictures 
"all and all yesterday was a great day  went to the lake, took some pictures; had a couple friends over, had some beers; had a fire  pretty decent birthday if i don't say myself             to the people who came over and made the day fun: thank you "
off to work (to what i hope is an uneventful day)  yesterday was alittle rough 
off to work  good news i have tomorrow off  the last couple days have been busy so it will be nice to just sit around the house and do nothing 
"one more day, then a day off  today is going to be a good day  dang it lol"
so tired of feeling unwanted and unattractive 
shitty ending to what started to be a perfect day  the story of my life 
"ebay is the devil        not really, it is just my new addiction "
yea  smile  my house smells like dirty hippies  i kinda missed that smell lol 
facebook is the devil 
off to bed  i plan on having a great day at work tomorrow so it will be fun 
early day at work  hopefully i'll get some much needed cleaning done  have tomorrow off though yea!

quote of the day: are you ready for the yellow man?
great night at work  got to finish this beer and go to bed so i can get some sleep for tomorrow  stupid facebook    the ultimate procrastination tool 
ehh     time to make the donuts 
off to what i e playful ect will be a good day at work 
going out to the bar tonight for some patio beers lol 
the day is now over  and i can get on with what i was doing 
off to bed  getting tired  but tomorrow will be uneventful so maybe i'll lay around eat and sleep all day 
always be yourself and you will have nothing to hide 
"kinda bored, looking for something to get into "
wasting time till i go into work  not enough time to get anything done but way too early to go in 
i really should be going to bed but i can't seem to get tired enough  ohh well 
off to work  at least theres air conditioning in the building     it's hot 
i plan on going to work 11-5 and then coming home and passing the f*** out  i'm so tired after the past couple days i'm getting slap happy  it's all good though; it's been fun 
i swear to god if one more person calls me naive or gullible i'm punching them in the face  all are warned 
"all and all today has been a good day and i have no complaints  i have lots of stuff i have to do tomorrow so it's off to bed  night fb     p s  it is mayonnaise not mayo, just sayin"
so hot it's way passed sticky 
bay fireworks were slightly depressing but ohh well  i'm sure i will be regretting those so called onion rings tomorrow lol it sounded like a good idea at the time 
going down to the tall ships festival  truely going to enjoy my day off 
"kinda just sitting around the house watching the wild kingdom, which is my backyard lol "
everything that happens in our lives provides an opportunity to grow in some way 
as soon as life starts getting normal again everything seems to want to change  convenient timing lol
your the best
today is a new day 
things are starting to get back to normal again  i love it when my life is boring and uneventful; things are so much simpler at that point 
back on the map and i plan on staying there lol 
the last two days have been awesome  and i only e playful ect it to get better 
another great start to the work week 
is on the hunt   
today will be better than yesterday  it has to be i will not except anything less 
yea! for my friday  i took a nap at 5pm yesterday and woke up 20 minutes ago lol  must've been tired  i don't know; i got nothin    smile 
work week is off to a good start  just keep it up till friday lol 
working 11-7  today will be a good day  not looking forward to coming home to an empty house though   
people keep telling me things have to get worse before they get better  but when are they going to get better????
back to work today  i only have a six hour day; it should fly by 
"worked at <propmale> river for lunch  it could've been worse but not by much  but i did have fun; when i wasn't holy stressed out  props to you <propmale>, you're more patient then i am "
i've never meant it more     tgif
class was fun; now i go back to the real world  lol
i really hope i don't have to cry tomorrow      lol
"i don't know when it happened and why exactly, but i just realized that i like and enjoy my job  weird    i know  i'll be sure to not investigate this to far and just ride the wave "
holy day from hell  i'm gonna go to bed and forget everything that had to do with today 
i'm gonna start migrating for the winter    
yet another day has came and went  all i have to say is what goes around comes around  and i will just wait for <propfemale> to pull through for me  it always does   
today really sucked  but i'm going to bed now and everything will be better when i wake up  i have the next two days off  so if anybody wants to <propfemale> out    you have my number 
longest work day ever     and i have to be back in 6 hours  damn sick people
