"just to let everyone know the ride went well today i am home safe and sound there was some ice and it was cold but all in all it was a good ride ,,life is good ,,,"
"please post this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons  dragons are nearly unstoppable and, in case you didn't know, they can totally breathe fire  60% of people won't copy and paste this because they've already been eaten by dragons  38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers, and the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post "
i am a bit lost in my head looking for direction
the gray sky is getting old thinking of taking a ride
sunshine was soooo nice today
it is a new day will see what it brings
happy to see the sun
it seems as though there is never enough time in the day to do all the thing needed to do
"life is good, it is just my mind that is messed up, accepting life for what it is, isn't  allways what i want"
good morning to all it is friday hope to see some of you this weekend
"some times life is like a feather in the wind, never knowing where i will land  i just hope i dont get stuck in a tree!"
well i have been on here long enough going to cascade locks for breakfeast
trying to find that balance between perfect and acceptance is not so easy
looks like my face book just upgraded and i am f---ked up lost got to learn all over
life is good musuc is good and i guess the dam rain is too
i got to get around things to do people to see places to go
so this is valentines day woppy seems just like any other day
i feel like i need a starbucks  coffee to get me going today
ok got the kitcken and the laundry done and now i dont want to cook becouse i just got it clean sounds like icecream dinner
i had a great day it was a lot of work but very rewarding life is good
this is looking like a motorcycle day great
i just got back from going to see my ex it went well she treated me as a human but it still hurts i am not sure about my feelings it just makes me want to cry
i can not make sence of my thoughts i seem to be all over the place yet no where scattered
i am grateful for my life today and i believe it is ok to shed a tear for those struggling
what a great day i had a nice ride to cascade locks this morning left me wanting more maybe i will just ride with no where to go and enjoy the weather
i seem to be trying to e playful lain myself and either i am not saying what i think i am saying or some people just want what they want and are not listining
"does this make any sense i want what i want i donâ€™t want what i donâ€™t want, why does not matter  if i accept what i donâ€™t want for what i want, then i will surly be miserable "
i am just trying to figure out why i think i have to figure out everything
i just did my taxes not as bad as i feared
i want to do something just dont know what so i sit here and do nothing
happy easter if you do that sorta thing if not good day to you too

today i can feel and know my feelings i just can't control them they are real though this i know
it has been a long day inside my head all fear baced fear of not being good enough or not getting what i want or just afraid    god <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change and the currage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the differance    acceptance is not easy for me   
angree the more i think the mader i get  this goes to whoever is watching me and reporting to my ex in prison as to where and what i do ask me i am not hidding
i am all good i had to deal with people watching and lieing about me for 27 years this just brought back a flood of feelings i don't need life is good

"i always think i need to know what is going to happen   what is the plan? where am i, what am i, what is going to happen next  i am learning slowly that the best things in my life were never planed they just happened  i am starting to like not knowing what is going to happen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"i went to cascade locks this morning sit with some friends wishing they could ride some are healing from various things in life and cannot  the only thing stopping me is me, so i have rain gear and i am gonna ride â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦"
