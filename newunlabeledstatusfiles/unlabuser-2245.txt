watching home alone 2  plan to goto bed soon 
"afternoon has arrived, thinking about playing computer games"
"just took loads of mypersonality tests, all seemed very accurate"
"need a shower, have to go to chiro in three hours"
mornings can always be a hasle
fullfilling day it has been
"those in groveport <propfemale> (network) please confirm me, i have added serveral people but still not yet confirmed "
"i felt like crap all day, hopefully i feel better tomorrow  good night "
"just got grams work's floor done, just got to let it dry  then back home to clean some more "
"sunday is over, monday is coming  the week is starting, or is it ending?"
"school, the place i rather be, interesting thought isn't it "
"late buses gotta love it  15 <propfemale> late to stop, and we are waiting for another bus at eastland "
i wonder if the bus will be 15 <propfemale> late again 
"school once again, love the the half hour it takes me to get ready"
"long bus ride home, might fall asleep "
reveling my heart
"time for bed, the clippers lost 8 to nothing "
had meatballs and garlic fries for lunch 
two hours till i have to catch the bus
"today starts yet another day, school is hours away, life is never ending, what will happen today?"
"life continues as more challenges present themselves, what you do at that time shall stay with you for the rest of your life "
"got my school laptop, added a real profile picture, and many other things"
"take what life throws at you, stop complaining, enjoy what you have and be happy every day!"
"when i am inspired, i write, when i write, i am creative, when i am creative, i knowledgeable, and when i am knowledgeable i am inspired  oh look a circle  laugh "
"life is filled with wonders, there are new e playful eriences to enjoy every day, though how you enjoy them is completely up to you "
"aaahhh, i cant come up with anything creative, or inspirational today  i suppose there will be days like that  it could be because i have a lot on my mind "
"the world keeps spinning, nothing will stop the world as time will never end  life may end but not time, time is just a way we view life and we should <propfemale> every minute of it "
cant wait till this starts
"whats the big deal about birthdays, you will never see that happy grin on your parents face when you were born  when you get older they just seem to push you away, so whats the big deal about birthdays  it is never the same twice "
almost time to start

"i am tired of people bitching about the webcast, if it is that annoying boring what ever, then just gtfo"
interesting thought (#foxfallparty live at http annoyed  ustre am nhrh )
"i am inspired, i must write  read my notes, i don't post to many but man they take a lot of time when i do write them lol "
"inspiration, always une playful ected, always thoughtful, always meaningful, but is it worth the wait?"
"inspiration is never the same, you may be inspired to wirte, but it is never the same topic  inspiration comes in many forms, all of which are une playful ected  i need inspiration, i want to write, but i have no inspiration for a good topic  i am accepting offers though, and who knows maybe there be a day i am inspired once again "
"i hope this week is interesting, i am tired of doing the same stuff over and over and over and over and over        maybe i can get lucky!"
"i was finally inspired, check out my longest note yet  once inspiration hits, it can last a while  life is filled with surprises, make them work for you   laugh "
"today will be a sad day, we may be putting my 15 year old cat down  sad "
"already tuesday, who knows what will happen, i wish i knew what to e playful ect, i may enjoy some surprises but most are just to much and you never know what will happen  i hope today is a good day "
"first day of a long weekend, i will be going to see a movie later today, but that doesn't mean i wont be board the rest of the day  i hope i can keep my self busy for some time "
"i slept all morning, but i was gone all afternoon  <propfemale> and <propfemale>, was great  i had great day, but tomorrow i have no plans, so it may be a boring day "
school burns        the long weekend is finally over  i can still hope for a good day
"a bit tired, having a cappuccino right now, don't know how much it is helping, but it is keeping me warm  tuesday is at the beginner of a week that seems to never end  though mornings are always like that, once school starts the day will fly by      i hope"
"the weekend is over, and has left me sore, although it was good, it has left me injured  i hope that the pain is tolerable during school, as it still hurts to move my arms, but playing football will do that to you  live life and enjoy every minute you are given  i may be in pain, but i had a good time "
"wow, i e playful ected rain today, but nothing that would shut down my transportation home  a tornado warning kept us at school, and then groveport busing was locked down so that kept me at school even longer  it was a very interesting day thus far, hope my class at devry is decent and works out okay "
"i have my college class tonight, i hope it will be entertaining, i really enjoyed it last week  also my lab teacher is allowing my to work ahead, so i am really excited "
"today's visitation was great, we had several people interested in computer support  many were also shocked by our security demonstration  cant wait for tomorrow "
"oday was another good visitation session, instead of shocking reactions from the security demonstration we had embarrassment reactions  i hope that the security demonstration is used again next year "
"today has been a good day, finally got to <propfemale> out with an old friend "
"snow!!! the ironic thing is that it is the first day of december, and my mom said she wanted it to snow  snow is always fun "
"am a free man tonight, i don't even have to pick up my sister today  i can literately stay here and stay warm  i wish it to snow all night starting now!!"
today is the last day before winter break!! we are going to party all day at school  laugh 
thinking about playing <propfirst> party with my six year old sister
