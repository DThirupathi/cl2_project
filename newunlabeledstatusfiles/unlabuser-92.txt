so after coming to the hospital lastnight with <propfemale> it still hasn't quiet hit me what's happend it probly won't till friday when the surgury is going to happen  but i have come to the determination that hospital eggs taste like crap 
so i'm sitting in bed unable to sleep (go figure) debating how much this sucks    yet i've no comprehension of how much this must suck for <propfemale> 
so 2 hours and counting till <propfemale>'s surgery  starting to get a bit nervous  but like i've been told a hundred times  she's in the best hands possible right now 
about 6 ish hours into the surgery god knows how much longer    it started to storm here  and somehow that's calming and reassuring 
work sux i'm still all for illegilization of no one awake before 6am

whohoo waiting blows

"i hate it when u have to be somewhere @ a certain time, not a minute sooner    and ur there like 15 minutes early    that 15 minutes drags by like an hour "
today is a great day!      so far     what? i'm being optimisitic 
i have a personal reason for asking if everyone could put this as their status for 1 hour  i'm pretty sure i know the ones that will  think of someone you know or love who has had cancer  my wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found  will you post it for 1 hour  to honor those who have fought or are fighting cancer and those who have lost the fight  
is it national cut-off a big fucking truck day?? did i not get a the memo?
according to <propfemale> i am officially a lesbian!    ?
f y i  it takes a freaking long time to fill 2 120 gallon diesel tanks    
i been up for the last 2 1 2 hrs     smile 
"<insert wise- morning, uplifting comment here>"
tried a new type flavor of coffee this am    and might i say wholy crap it works!
so i've realised a peave i didn't even know i had    when the blinker outside the truck blinks faster than out of sync with the blinker on the dash    only affected when i can see both  however in a semi   that's often 
well this is an awesome way to start the day  truck broke down omw to my first stop
awesome day just got more awesomer     tire on the trailer blew out omw back to the warehouse 
"ever get that feeling that no matter what happens today is going to be an awesome day?\\figured out why    caffine overload @ 4am"
"what is the purpose of being in a video game store for more than two hours, when you aren't being paid to be???"
whoever said  do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life    what's your answer to doing what you love for people you hate?
sunday drivers are so slow    they're a day late 
"five scottish words of wisdom  \\1  money cannot buy happiness but somehow, it's more comfortable to cry in a <propfemale> benz than it is on a bicycle \\2  forgive your enemy but remember the bastard's name \\3  help a man when he is in trouble and he will remember you when he is in trouble again \\4  many people are alive only because it's illegal to shoot them \\5  alcohol does not solve any problems, but then neither does milk "
"stupid people are stupid- if i tell you your crooked in the dock  and i cant back in  your response should not be  no im not crooked, they're unloading the truck "
"also  if the back of a grocerystore says not a through street  dont be suprised when you try to cut through behind the store, and you cant get through because semis are blocking the path "
"they call me    \murderer of tires\"""""
so awesome day gets more awesomer (yes i know how that sounds and its awesome) busted another trailer tire 
my only regret is that i put no whiskey in my coffee this morning
