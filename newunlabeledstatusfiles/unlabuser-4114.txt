"if you are waiting for anything in order to live and love without holding back, then you suffer  every moment is the most important moment of your life  no future time is better than now to let down your guard and love "
"right now, and in every now-moment, you are either closing or opening  you are either stressfully waiting for something - more money, security, affection - or you are living from your deep heart, opening as the entire moment, and giving what you most deeply <propfemale> to give, without waiting "
"soon the child's clear eye is clouded over by ideas and opinions,preconceptions and abstractions simple free being becomes encrusted with the burdensome armor of the ego not until years later does an instinct come that a vital sense of mystery has been withdrawn the sun glints through the pines,and the heart is pierced in a moment of beauty and strange pain, like a memory of paradise after that day,we become seekers "
going to mall by myself in a little bit  maybe i'll find something i want 
"you and i are essentially infinite  choice-makers  in every moment of our existence, we are in that field of  all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices  -deepak chopra    i'm ready!!  laugh "

"busy day  going to cut <propfirst>'s hair, take him to the store, pick up my shoes from dad's house, then go to work "
trying to decide if i want to be a manager for fashion bug    ?????
it's annoying being around people who gossip when i'm the one person who doesn't  seriously people   can't you just shut up?
"so   basically at my job i have to be this bubbly outgoing person, which is not me at all  it's driving me nuts  i don't feel like i'm being myself, and my energy drains really fast   aaand that's mostly the reason i haven't decided yet if i want to be a manager there "

"at any moment, you have a choice,  that either leads you closer to your spirit or further away from it  -thich nhat <propfemale>"
"love\ is what we are born with  fear is what we have learned here  the \spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and the acceptance of love \back into our hearts "
"never shop at papaya clothing  my first e playful erience with their clothing has been the worst ever  cheap materials and they suck  you won't ever get your money back   or even an exchange if something is ruined the first time washed  my advice, don't waste your money "

"you\ know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a \single power, a single salvation   and that is called loving \well then, love your suffering \do not resist it, do not flee from it \it is only your aversion to it that hurts, nothing else  -hermann hesse"

spiritual evolution occurs as the result of removing obstacles and not actually acquiring anything new  devotion enables surrender of the mind's vanities and cherished illusions so that it progressively becomes more free and more open to the light of truth 
"\i accept your ickys \"" hahahahahaha """
there is no better time than now   
"stomach pain, go away "
if you don't want me here just tell me   because this hurts 
the downside of spiritual education is the buildup of the vanity of 'i know' and the devaluation of people who are 'not spiritual'  therefore it is important as a foundation to spiritual training and education to learn how consciousness manifests as the ego and its mechanisms  - <propfirst> r  hawkins
