heading home like now   laugh  i'm packing to get home to jacksonville! brb in like two and a half hours!
finally home  it's so weird here  o_0
found my 7th and 8th chrono crusade books as i left the house yesterday  *_* it's a good series when i can open up to the last few pages of the 8th book and immediately begin to cry 
"tonight has just been further proof that i have the coolest, most amazing friends in the history of ever  case closed "
"well, that chem test went better then it did the first time  at least i finished  ^^"
you know what's boring? calculus   annoyed  at least i'm understanding these problems in the book    
"got a <propmale> to wear my new <propfemale> shoes and they didn't hurt my feet! now some chem lab, calc review at two and grocery shopping later  not a bad day "
"fff hell yes! i just got the results back for my second chem test  95, whoot!  laugh  and i went to a calc review today, so hopefully i'll do good tomorrow too   laugh "
"so i'm going through the test i just took in calc    and i've realized that i hate it even more because it's online  if someone had been grading it and saw the work i did, i would have gotten partial credit on everything i got wrong in the system  *sigh* oh well "
the best way to start a morning you had to get up wicked early for? a nice half hour of the doctor to make everything better   laugh 
"<propmale> horror was amazing, for those who care  in the same night, they made both a joke about megacon and catgirls and used doctor who in a callback  made  my  life   laugh "
"bah, saying goodbye is always the hardest part  still, a petticoat, a <propmale> horror show and six hours on skype later, this weekend was beyond amazing  best of all, it reminded me how many people and how much love i have in my life  even after all of the people that faded out of my life  i'm blessed  i'm so, so blessed  i love and miss all of you   love "
doing some research = watching a movie  i love my survey of rock class   laugh

"did some research on quad and <propfirst> for my paper, have an outline for the presentation, did my final <propfemale> service learning class, started drawing a picture of cellix that i'm actually sorta kinda pleased with, spent 40 minutes on ddr, am caught up in all of my work and realized that i've smiled and laughed more at the littlest things since i got here  i think today was a good day   love "
"just finished midnight from doctor who   and all i can say is the preview for the next few episodes is like, \whuuut?\"""""

"as pointless as today's performance was, i'm glad we did because it led to an entire day of hanging out with the trombones   wink "
"thank god for all of my new music  if i didn't have it, i wouldn't have survived today  @_@ marukaite chikyuu    "
thanks to <propmale> gifford for inviting me to that music forum; it made that calculus test so much better 
"so if an entire class fails a test, doesn't that indicate that something about the style of teaching isn't working? because apparently my calc teacher thinks it's our fault  *sigh* today has been pretty awful because of that class, but i don't know what to do except keep moving forward "
"well, my paper is printed out and completed  9 pages later and i've still got a ton of studying to do  oi   laugh  at least i've still got my music  it's the only thing that's kept my spirits so high   love "

"so the honors college has a writing contest going on and one of the categories is fiction and another is poetry  does   does anyone think it would be a good idea to submit that little thing i wrote the other day, just for kicks? is it accessible enough for people who don't know what it's about? and is it poetry or prose? o_0 i dunno, i just thought it might be kinda cool to actually enter a writing contest   "
"best song to listen to before going to take a calculus exam? \make it mine\"" by <propfirst> mraz   love  time to go show this test exactly what i'm made of!"""

"i don't wanna hear a damn word from people about my fandom: i just took a quiz in forensics after at least half of the class read the wrong chapter, myself included, and i got one of the questions right because i knew the chinese empire went back further than 3,000 years  damn straight "
