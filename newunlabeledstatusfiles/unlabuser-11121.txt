three days grace was awesome  but breaking <propmale> was better!
we can't spend our lives waiting to live 
big bang theory is probably the best show ever
history is dumb  they shouldn't have recorded it so i didn't have to learn it 
"'cause life starts now\you've done all the things that could kill you somehow\and you're so far down\but you will survive it somehow\because life starts now"
finally got that photo story done for history  that took ridiculously too much time
every second counts cuz there's no second try  so live like you'll never live it twice 
each day's a gift and not a given right 
"even if you haven't led it in long time, the football breakdown just comes to you at the end of practice "
"leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind, and try to take the path less traveled by "
"i dont even wanna go to bed cuz its summer and why waste perfectly good summer time with stupid sleeping  but there is absolutely nothing to do so really, i have no other choice"
football practice + riding bike afterwards = just wanting to sit here and do nothing   forever
very bored  wants something to do
act tomorrow   yippee
couldnt sleep last night cuz i was thinking about many many things 
listening to the ipod  sanding the car wanna get it done but it is taking quite a while   saw a commercial for the edge cd collection on spike looked like it had some pretty good music so i believe ill be looking up all the songs and frostwiring them soon  text me mobiles on the profile 
internet sucks  no more video games for me tonight
sleep = bad i shall never surrender to it!  at least until the bored meter reaches extreme   and even then its questionable!
discovering new and interesting music
"so do whatever it takes\'cause you can't rewind a moment in this life\let nothin' stand in your way\cause the hands of time are never on your side"
will smith is my favorite  seven pounds is a great great movie   watched it again today
football time  half asleep but sleep isnt worth it anyway so who cares 
currently listening to simple man by shinedown  happens to be my favorite song
would like something to do
"ya know that thing where you are sitting down then get up and get all light headed, cant see, and fall down  well that just happened to me"
big ol storm a brewin!
laying outside watching the stars  tis a wonderful thing
<propfemale> is mentally handicapped cuz of her status!
i tried to type all the things that i thought about with one glance of the stars but the very condensed version was 958 characters and you are only allowed like 400 some 
internet: sometimes it just doesnt work
pandemic 2::way too difficult!
i'm gay
im not gay silly <propfemale> 
listening to bullet for my <propfirst>'s fever album
stumbleupon com makes me laugh tis very entertaining
made a football cd  mixed pump up rock and rap with a few lockerroom favorites 
awesome weekend at wauseon
"everything is gonna be alright  \everything is gonna be alright \everything is gonna be alright \be strong believe "
"best, you've got to be the best\you've got to change the world\and use this <propmale> to be heard\your time is now"
"it's alright \to tell me \what you think \about me\i won't try \to argue \or hold it \against you"
"and how can we win,\when fools can be kings,\don't waste your time,\or time will waste you,"
"i know we have given\all that we can give\when there's nothing to <propfemale> on\well, i remember this\all we make of this lifetime\is always here within\and remembering that's why\we should never give in"
i wont go down till im six feet underground 
you think youve won this fight  youve only lost your mind 
if i was a superhero i would break free  wouldnt need anyone to come and save me  and you couldnt make me feel like im crazy 
when it feels like a kick in the teeth i can take it 
say what you want  take your shots  you're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth 
so are we breaking out or are we breaking down?
the time has come to open our eyes and be blinded by the sun 
oh i know that but im right
"my friend, this life we live\is not what we have, it's what we believe"
ready for thursday to happen
fall is the best season ever 
playin xbox with the guys 
forgive ones enemys but never forget their names
the world is now saved once again thanks to software from the internet 
half frozen apple sauce is awesome!
its never too late to live your life the tidigs now its do or die  its never too late to live your life the time is now its yours and mine
