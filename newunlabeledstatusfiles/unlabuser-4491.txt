"sleepless and tired never a good combo  time to eat some steak and potatoes then try to squeeze in an hour or so of sleep  \wish the brain had an off switch "

"loving the heat got outside did some work around the house going for a walk later 93 degrees so vary nice \ i can feel my skin waking up again "
"200 foot of fence up now have to build a new coop and then i'll be ready for my chicks to run free  maybe more, more work and more animals "
