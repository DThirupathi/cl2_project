the hardest lesson a parent learns is which battles to fight for your child and which battles they have to fight on their own but i do wish some of the people in their world would wisen up to the hard feelings they have caused and continue to cause 
"blazer wrestling banquet was tonite  lots of awards  every single one of our wrestlers had earned enough points to letter!!!! they are an amazing group  what a season!! congrats to all of our boys and managers, especially <propfirst> and <propfemale> kae "

hell hath no fury like a ticked off mom with a cause!
"ahhhhhhhh a cup of coffee, shoes off, just contemplating the day lol"
note to self and others: if you were silly enough to allow your high school friends to sign your yearbooks and didnt censor what they wrote then do not be foolish enough to leave them on the bookshelf where a bored teenager may come across them and decide that reading is fun!

enjoying a quiet evening at home  made a necklace to replace the broken chain on my st  <propfirst>'s medallion  <propfemale> would be so proud lol

"happy monday everyone! had a great weekend with family and friends! going to use today to run some much needed errands, catch up on housework, and get ready for the week  its back to school tomorrow for the final push to the end of the school year! i hope the kids are ready to work!"
why are people so easily offended when something simple with a simple e playful lanation is e playful ressed? especially when no offense is obviously meant  what is it in our nature to make everything about us instead of the person who is e playful ressing their wishes?
happy tuesday everyone! i hope everyone has a great day! its back to work today and then i think i will head out to the farm for the first time since a couple weeks before the wedding        am looking forward to getting out there and working with the horse etc 
home from school! been fighting the headache from hell all day        not sure i will make the farm  sad  got more paperwork done on all the name change stuff today  smile  (by the way changing your name takes an act of congress) all in all a good day except for the headache  spaghetti for supper for kids and hubby     rice for me!

<propfemale> made a very pretty necklace tonite! was fun watching her work and plan and do! think this is gonna be a great hobby       thanks <propfemale>!
i am not overjoyed to see snow on my grass and mudpuddles that will take forever to go away because of the construction mess  could use for the coffee to brew a <propmale> quicker           i need some fortification 
i am so sick of this headache!!! nothing is working!!!
took a bath      laid on the couch        took more meds        watched a movie (by the way precious was a great movie) and my head still hurts! hopefully tomorrow its better!
the headache from hell is here to stay! going back to bed as soon as i get the kids off to school!
why is it the construction guys are only busy all day when i am home with a headache? would take a miracle to get them to work this long and hard any other day of the week 
took <propfemale> out to the holel with my parents to relax in the hottub a bit before bed! she is nervous about tomorrow but hanging in there   i am finally feeling a <propmale> better      lets hope it continues      need to be in top form for my girl tomorrow!
happy friday everyone! surgery day for my <propfemale> girl! she is less than motivated to wake up and get going          who can blame her! will keep everyone posted as best i can throughout the day  have a great day!
home from the hospital! surgery went well  <propfemale> is having some difficulties with the anesthesia and will be on oxygen until tomorrow at a minimum  she was quite a trooper and has done great! keeping on top of the pain and getting her o2 sats up is our big goal for today and the next couple days!
<propfemale> had a great night! pain is under control  will <propfemale> out for a few more hours then will go to the hospital to get her o2 levels checked and hopefully she can come off the oxygen  its a beautiful morning        last nights rain has everything green and pretty this morning 
home from the hospital  <propfemale>'s oxygen level is back up and holding where it needs to be and her bp is down closer to where it should be  she is having some pain but is managing it well  good news! what a tough cookie!
"<propfirst> and <propfirst> have been such a big help during this time with jodi        they run and do and keep us in what we need and don't complain and run and do some more and still don't complain! i have such a great husband and son! thanks also to my parents and my friends who have helped out or sent happy thoughts, good wishes, and prayers! we are very lucky!"
happy sunday everyone! we are into <propfemale>'s second day out of surgery and she continues to be one of the toughest cookies i have ever met  she is determined to go to school tomorrow  due to the weight of her splint and the distance she would have to cover in the school she will be using a wheelchair during school hours  i am so proud of her!!!
<propfemale> wants some air        getting a bit of cabin fever so we are relocating to the porch for a bit  we sorted some of the jewelry stuff earlier and are going to work on some new pieces tonite 
<propfemale> resting well again      was beautiful outside     she had a big smile sitting out there  burgers on the grill tonite       mike is quite the grill master  smile  am going to run over to a friends to see their new furniture and trade out some movies for the <propfemale> girl  all in all a good evening ahead!
been a busy evening  <propfemale> made her bear that <propfirst> and <propfirst> bought her while i made a necklace for <propfemale>  need to finish <propfemale>'s bracelet so i can get them sent off tomorrow  then if i get time i am going to make one more necklace tonite  <propfemale> stopped by to say hello and the guys took the dogs for a run 
mmmmmmmmmmm coffee!
procrastinating on getting ready for work! none of the grownups slept well last night and am dragging now  wish it was my busier day at work so i wouldnt feel sleepy all day!
<propfirst> morrison - into the mystic        showing my age and lovin it lol
"if you have a husband that makes you laugh, that you can say is your best friend, who you want to grow old with, who you know will always be there to pick you up when you are feeling down and a man that you are thankful for every night, then copy and paste this to your profile    i love you <propfirst>!"
<propfemale> did well at school today! pain is manageable but it wiped her out pretty good  she came home and slept several hours  she is a bit hestitant to try it again      guess we will see what morning brings 
well      it must be official        all the appropriate government agencies and my bank say my last name has changed lol
thinks sometimes the key to creating something is knowing when to walk away from it when it takes on a life of its own               
happy thursday everyone! too many things going on both good and not so good to put it all in here today so will just wish everyone to have a wonderful day!
"<propfemale> cant wait to see the dr in the morning  something lighter to lug around than that big splint  she has done so good this week, we are so proud of her!!!!"
"cant begin to tell you how appreciative i am of the torrington dentists who have been so helpful and willing to put my health above the almighty dollar -not! and people talk shop at home, part of the reason i struggle to do business in torrington is people are rude and unhelpful! happy friday everyone and sorry i am so crabby!"
am working on sending pics of <propfemale>'s appt to my email at the moment! will post in a bit  she is out of the big splint and into a regular cast which weighs much less and is lots more comfortable       and we were even able to make a close match with her prom dress  smile  dr  says she is doing great!
happy monday everyone! i will be off to the dentist (finally!!!) today  had a quiet weekend on the couch and the kids and <propfirst> took great care of me! they are awesome! hope everyone has a great day and week!
off to <propfemale> again today to get more dental work done! hopefully this will be it and will fix the problem       i am tired of the pain and need to get refocused on other things that are getting ignored while i deal with this mess! thanks to all my friends who have helped out and to my family who have been so good to me while i deal with this        
well it appears that i am going to live through this mess  i still have some swelling and sensitivity but the dr  says that should be gone within a few days (two weeks at the outside)  on some of the meds a few more days and then should be good to go  am ready to go back to work and get on with life!
happy wednesday everyone! its back to work for me today   yayyyyy! lots to catch up on  will be focusing mostly on paperwork and stuff like that today and hopefully will get everything all set for the rest of the school year  hopefully going to get <propfemale>'s jewelry for prom done in the next few days and things caught up around the house too

"<propfirst> <propmale> is getting his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for the 9th time, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods are screwing everything, but same sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage? really?? copy and paste if you agree "

"while you scream at your woman, there's a \man wishing he could talk softly to her ear  while you humiliate, offend\and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how \wonderfu lshe is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he \could make love to her  while you make your women cry there's a man \stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against \domestic violence "

ever have one of those days where you just know before the end of the day you are going to be required to attend out loud voices anonymous as part of your sentence?
"interesting fb topic of the day: have had some interesting conversations the last week or so with several people on the <propmale> of forgiveness  how and why do we forgive? who do we forgive? can you forgive someone and still remove them from your life? i have had this conversation with my kids, friends, family and i am never completely sure what to say  please share your thoughts and have a great day!"
yesterday i put out a topic to discuss and was really impressed with the responses  thought we would try another topic today that maybe is more fun! so here it is: if you were going to write a book about your life and could not use your name in the title and the title could only be three words what would those words be:
watched big brother and then went for ice cream with the kids  all in all a good evening  am off to bed to think of a new topic for tomorrow morning  thanks to those of you that responded the last couple days!
"good morning everyone! todays topic is \what does \""customer service\"" mean to you?:"""

"ever noticed that we tend to have conversations with the people in our lives repetitively? like a bunch of hamsters in crazy little wheels: you should, she he said, i did, etc  for today i am stepping off the wheel and having a different conversation with as many people as i can  i will not relive history, especially history that i dont want to repeat itself  anyone care to join me?"

the city of torrington is ridiculous! they can afford staff to hand deliver notices to our neighbors and us to shovel the walks but they cant be bothered to plow the streets and make them safe? citizens shouldnt have to wield a shovel on their sidewalks til the city can provide snow removal on those streets! just an opinion!!!
