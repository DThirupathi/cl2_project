"i'm done with homework for the weekend  i've put in just over 23 hours of work on it, and i can't think properly any longer  with my head throbbing from a cold, and my mind tormenting me with thoughts of that which i don't have, i can't think of anything else i need to improve my work, so i'm done "
"alrighht finally a sick voice that instead of being high-pitched or mid puberty, is deep and sexy  knowing my luck this manly will be gone before i tak to anyone though "
"i hate those dreams where your desires and wants come true, and everything is perfect and happy  and then you wake up and realize none of it happened, and most of it probably never will happen, even if you do the best you can to make them happen "
"does anyone know the name of some bands that play extremely dark music filled past the brim with testosterone? death metal,screamo, heavy metal, etc just isn't adrenaline filling enough today "
"its been a long day, hopefully my mind will let me rest tonight without anymore mocking dreams  could really use a hug or someone to talk with, but its quarter after 2 in the morning so i doubt that'll happen  goodnight, sleep well everyone "
"today has been so much fun, enjoyed a mcgangbang at mc donalds with <propmale> and <propmale>, then played with a monkey robot, turned the barnie song into a <propfemale> core song, and had a pillow fight in walmart  i can see why people don't always believe me when i say i'm straight as a ruler, i do some pretty wierd things   wink   wink   wink  intepic day so far"
"i have had a lot of adventures today, after all that earlier stuff, went on a trip through memory <propfirst>, ran around a semi-built house that didn't have a gate around it yet, and learned a life lesson from hamtaro  still would be nice to <propfemale> out with more people and to get a nice hug  lonliness depression is much harder to push out of mind than other types "
"open house was interesting, feeling like i passed up a number of opportunities but oh well, theres always tomorrow for that  now back to homework "
"well that dream i ahad pointed out most everything i've done wrong so far  lets see if i can stop screwing up and actually start getting to know her, cause if i can't even talk to her than i'm a coward  i'm going to talk to her today i swear it "
"well i talked to her, but she just said one word and quickly walked away  i'm kinda glad she didn't see me cry, but i wish she knew how i felt, and how painful it is for her to just walk away so quickly   crying "
how do i always screw everything up? you think that after years of fcking up daily i'd be able to do something right occasionally  i can't do anything right 
that was a much needed uplifting 
ok so i guess myfrenchnightmare isn't working right now so i'll do my french tomorrow

i'm so unsure about what to do  there so much conflictory information  i don't know how to procede or analyze the situation  i need to talk with some people so i can figure out what the hell the situation actually is 
yeah i really did just stop by at school for lunch  i've got more important things to do today than highschool classes  i've got college and a personal life that needs dealing with 
"ok ok so everyone having a lousy time at life right now it seems  so i propose we make a holiday where everyone just parties and shows everyone how much they love each other  it'll be amazing, just need to figure out when to place it, and some other peramiters  which branches off to telling you all that i love you guys  you're amazing   love "

"well that was fun  glad to be back home  i love dances i may not be able to dance well, but i;ll be damned if i'm not the most spirited dancer out there   laugh  loads of fun, saw people i havn't seen in years, like <propfirst>, <propfemale>, <propfirst>, <propfirst>, <propfemale>, oh yeah fun night "

"warning this comment will have curse words in it, i'm just using this to let you know that the comment is where my actual status will be "
"well that was a disaster  i'm crap when it comes to leading stuff  and not sleeping at night is begining to leave me really irritable  god i hope i don't blow up at school, cause its getting really hard to think or stay calm, both basic things i need to do "
