"are any of you guys reading manga at all? i'm totally hooked on this new series called fruits basket by natsuki takaiya  it's really the kind of romance story i like; although, it kind strange that it was written for girls  regardless, i don't think it's such a bad thing to e playful ress your feelings every once in awhile  love is no exception, but i guess that's me just being too sensitive "
the bach festival starts next week  i'm going to chopin's dedication at <propfemale> college on june 11th  that's his 200th birthday 
"i find little solace in bach, beethoven, ect  when the man in front acts like a windmill  we are pilots, not servants "
