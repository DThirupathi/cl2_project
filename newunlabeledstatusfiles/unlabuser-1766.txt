went to the zoo today    drama tomorrow and then the day after that school starts if your not a freshman   
"well    school wasn't the most exciting day in the world   just more of sitting around either reviewing (spanish), taking notes about a very easy concept (real <propfirst>), 1 last class about going over a syllabus (geography), and then working my butt off in band for being graded on our marching technique and stuff   "
today was made into a better day by starting to blast green day when i got home while starting to make dinner     hurray for 21st century breakdown!
well    today was    okay to say the least   
just got back from checking out the fair downtown at septemberfest   it was pretty fun though we only went on two rides- the tower and the ferris wheel   other than that today was exhausting 
i'm excited!  i just got my homecoming dress yesterday!!!
i think the best thing about today was drama    other than that its wasn't the best day in the world 
its storms like this that helps my day become better  smile    thunderstorms are just awesome like that
well    partially okay day    still not the best but hey    noth much i can do about it at this point

i think i like it on the chair  smile 
well    based off of how this episode of house is going    house is in huge trouble 
i think my favorite show of the night was papio south    just think    and then it would be bellevue west's    state was a lot of fun     i also had a blast spending the night at <propfirst>'s  smile 
i feel tonight went fairly well   
yesterday was very overwhelming but i had a good time surrounded with my family 
where do we go when we just don't know and how do we relight the flame when it's cold? why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing and when will we learn to control?
first chair ftw!!

had first job interview today at walgreens (90th and fort)   i feel pretty darn good about it    i find out if i get the job tomorrow!
"i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do about you now    \\there are many things that i would like to say to you but i don't know how    \\(i couldn't decide which one of the two i want to put up    so i put up both)"
today has been interseting to say the very least 
soooo    sadface   i have found that talk like a pirate day is on a b day   
"can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken\your best friend always sticking up for you\even when i know you're wrong?\can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance\five-hour phone conversation\the best soy latte that you ever had, and me?"
i miss you
