"church, then work until 6, then free as a bird "
i'm so confused   
"had a great morning, almost smooshed 2 animals with my car, and now i'm ready for bed - not a bad hump day "
hmmm   i don't know how i should feel right now   i'm torn between several emotions and none of them are very logical   i need to start channelling spock 
do you still like me?  i just need to know   for my own piece of mind and to convince myself that i'm not unloveable   these are the kinds of posts you get from me at 3 smile 0 in the morning   the dark enhances introspective thought 
longest day ever 
"it would be an amazing day for a bike ride  no wind, no rain, blue skies and sunshine   perfect "
where is the on switch for my brain???? and who turned it off in the first place????
silvan easter   sigh 
"oh, lordy  save me now   "

   the old man is snoring    'ugh   you snore!'
i just saw a giant rat run accross the parking lot at work!! icky!!!!!!!!
at the drive in    in the old man's ford   behind the bushes    until i'm screamin for more   in the basement    lock the cellar door and baby    talk dirty to me!!! **yup   still stuck in my head   why is it so darn catchy??**
days like today make me wish i was independently wealthy  it's too nice to be inside!!!
"i think i need a karaoke night with my most favorite people   i know they won't all be able to be there, but i can settle for a select few    you down?"
"running errands with my puppy, work until 8 smile 0, then hopefully <propfemale>ing out and relaxing with some friends! text me if you want to <propfemale> out!!"
"to sum up the last few weeks: men can be more trouble than they're worth, work is boring, and i got a puppy  now for a nite of fun to offset the crappy!"
"ok   here's the plan: sargeant pepper's in oakdale for bad karaoke, waffle fries and beer! let's everyone show up and be rowdy!"
i made chicken noodle soup from scratch! yumm-o!
"gonna relax, have a drink or two and <propfemale> out with the hubby and some good pals   what a way to end the week!"
"i'm having a pizza dinner with <propfemale>, then i'm home alone - peace and quiet, i get the remote and computer to myself, and i can actually get things done without someone in my way   it's not all bad "
so   breaking news: my car window got busted out at maplewood mall  last time i let <propfirst> touch my car 
"dropped my car off and managed to get to work on time! dang, i'm good   "
i'm in the mood for sweet and sour chicken from <propfemale> chin   but no one will eat it with me   sad

"mmmmm, sliders   just had a wonderfully creepy dining e playful erience at white castle   guy in the next booth was staring at me the whole time   i feel dirty and violated   "
"it's raining, it's pouring  the old man is snoring   he went to bed and bumped his head and didn't wake up till the morning "
i want your love and i want your revenge    you and me could write a bad romance   
"it's been an icky, boring, lonely week   "
boys can suck it! i'm spending a night with my girls!!
i like the feel of your name on my lips  and i like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss  the way that your fingers run through my hair  and how your scent lingers even when you're not there   
just saw a cute guy <propfemale> a nice little buell pop his clutch and almost drop his bike! hahaha! made my day
