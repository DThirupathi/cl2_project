movie night!
"okay, sweetheart, i know you don't wish to believe that our world rotates around the sun but indeed yourself but really, your constant intrusions on conversations and exertions of what you believe to be witty comments are rather annoying  so please try to realize that we the people, whom you so humbly grace with your presence, grow tiresome of your presence and brash words so please, just leave now "
hmmm watch the football game with my mother? i think so  smile 
i finally made a facebook  smile 
just got home from show choir and i amazingly didnt mess up my solo  smile  well think i'm going to lay down so all of you lovely people should text me

i love people who find it necessary to make other people miserable and pissy just because they're having a bad day   
"hmm what to do, what to do   "
people need to learn how to take a joke     annoyed 
well this day just keeps getting better and better   
so i kinda really want to go for a walk   
"seeing clash of the titans later!!! woot, today is just goin  to be great  smile "
"just when you think the day is going to be a good one, everything just happens to go wrong   "

ahhh you're all fake!!! you potray what people want of you but not what you want of yourself  you all aim to be cool kids with everyone surrounding but yet you're all alone instead of being the loser you really are with that one friend next to you and yet somehow you're never alone
"just got home from hanging with shelbs and slightly <propfirst>, which was pretty interesting   smile "
tylers gonna be here soon and then its off to take twenty billion pictures!  smile

i want to go to the movies and see <propfirst> hood!!! someone come with me   
"okay to everyone in relationships  when ya break up it is not the end of the world, hell its not even a big shock  get over yourselves! life's too short to be worrying about stupid things like why they broke up with you or what do they have that you don't  and if things work out and ya get back together, great  if not, owell move on  and yeah, i know i'm high school and i don't know much, i'm just ranting i guess  smile "
sitting at <propfirst>'s with shelb and zach  work tomorrow and well i'm not too sure what else   
"so, i think i'm dying    no matter what i take my head won't stop throbbing and it's really starting to hurt"
summer just needs to get here already so i can be around people i actually like and care about    plus i really want to go on vacation   smile

my spoon is too big     laugh 
"so even though my brother is a jerk and obnoxious and rude and stubborn and    well i think you get the point, i can't help but love him with all my heart   smile "
"haha i can hear my arteries gasping for air, jeez i'm gonna die one day   "
"i just worked nine hours and it honestly wasn't that bad, we got our butts kicked but i think me and nine hour shifts could get along quite famously  smile "
i love not being able to sleep especially when i get to work all day the next day  smile 
"hah, i love when people try to hit on you through the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant  it's pretty silly  smile "
i think i just might be a bum today  smile 
"yay, i get my pay check tomorrow!!!!! i so excited!!!!  laugh "
"i love when people try to act gangster, i think it's quite appealing "
"i work 10 hours tomorrow soooo i'm off to bed, night  laugh "
"honestly, being single is really starting to get annoying   "
my stomach hurts soooo much    :?
"why doesn't life come with a \redo\"" button?   """
well i wanted to go shopping but thats not going to happen so i guess all i'm doing to day is working 
ugh i hate not being able to drive    i want food   
that was like the best nap ever  smile 
so i took a psychological personality test and parts of it made me smile while others were quite depressing   
i went shopping today and it was great!!! i found this amazing corset top and my mom actually let me get it!!! i so excited  smile 
"guess who just made peanutbutter chip brownies, this kid!!!! ?"
"so, you think the city of struthers homepage would let you know when struthers day was   "
"so i just watched the new daughter, with <propfirst> costner love , and it was like super amazing up until the end and then it really made me angry   "
picking up my check and then going shopping with my brother!!!  smile  i love my life
"sooo i finally got to see toy story 3, i cried so hard at the end   "
i can't go to struthers day tomorrow     i work 5 to something  annoyed

"i'll never let you find me  i'm leaving you behind with the past  no, i won't look back  and i don't want to hear your reasons  don't want to hear you tell me why i should stay    ???"
soooo i really want a pet chinchilla and i think i just might be able to convince my mom to let me get one  smile 
ok see theres this kid named mikey and i'm going to punch him the next time he pokes me
"so work was horrible tonight    i get to open tomorrow and then to a \taco <propfemale> alumni\"" picnic at <propmale>'s house    it's safe to say that taco <propfemale> is now my life"""
"ugh just got home, today definitly had it's ups and downs but overall not bad  taking a nap and then heading to my sister's house for the night  smile "
called into work sooo idk whats going on with tonight   
hmmmm i wonder if i'll actually have tomorrow off  smile

"i love the people i work with, i really do  smile "
"i'm off tomorrow!  laugh  going to the bank in the morning and then who knows how the rest of the day will play out    oh at work some old drunk guy tried to figure out where i live today, that was fun   "

"oh, hey, guess who's working two of their three days off?     yeah you got it, this kid "
cleaning and then off to work
"i feel so alone, it's too quiet someone text me    "
so i jogged in the morning and then later walked everywhere in struthers with <propfirst>    i think i'm good for today  smile  and i bought amazing eyeshadow 
i don't think i've ever truly wanted to physically hurt another person until now   
"i absolutely love the people i work with, i always leave laughing  smile "
"i'm not a perfect person, there's many things i wish i didnt do    but i continue learning   smile "
"ok i'm going to jog to clear my head, come home take a shower and then go to work  i hope it'll be a good day   "
"have you ever been a part something that you thought would never end and then, of course, it did?? alright getting ready for work  hah i get to start my birthday off right, at the <propfemale>   laugh "
just got off work  happy birthday to me!!!  laugh 
"i hope that one day instead of complaining about everything, people learn to find the brighter side in situations  that for every \dilema\"" in your life there will always be a positive aspect to counter it  and remember your life could be worse so why not try to be thankful that usually the biggest problem in your life stems from drama and pettiness """
hmmm i think me and my mommy need a spa day    my treat  smile 
well i'm off today   smile  i think i will go out to eat and shop with my mom and then hopefully see some of my friends today

i love how i got off work at 12 but was there until 1   
"got to <propfemale> with karastin and them today it was pretty great, i was assured that i have nice legs   smile "
i love how i go into work and i'm told that i'm off today   
yay just worked 10 hours but was there for 12 buuuutttt i did talk to a guy at fiveguys who would trade me burgers for tacos! that totally made my day  smile 
"eh, i don't know why i ever tried  maybe in the begining we could've had something but after that first failed attempt there really was no point in trying  now you act as if i'm not here   "
tried to take a nap before i go into work but that didnt exactly work   
three more days    just three more days till im on the beach and not worrying about work or people or anything   
hmmm i think i'm gonna go watch some meteors later  smile 
my brothers back at college     won't see him for another 5 months  on the brighter side tomorrow's the last day and then vacation   smile 
"hah i just heard taco <propfemale>'s commercial for our new \delicious\"" <propfemale> tacos on the radio and i don't think i've laughed that hard in a while  smile """

so i went to kareokee night and sang annnnnnnnnnnnd it was amazing  laugh

go out to the pool to find two drowned crabs  annoyed 
horseback riding was amazing! got a bruise from the stirrup though  annoyed 
on my way home  cant wait to see everyone  smile 
so i definitly just saw one of the cutest guys ever  smile 
yay i probably just got poison <propfemale> trying to catch this friggin cat for these people at a rest stop    at least i caught him
i'm home! i'm home! i'm home! i'm finally friggin home! lol i missed everyone so much and this may be weird but i honestly can't wait to go to work tomorrow
so first day back to work didn't really go as i hoped it would    tomorrow will be better hopefully 
ok i'm pretty proud of myself right now  all of my honors english work is done when usually i'm doing it the night before school starts 
i can't sleep and i open tomoroow   i love it 
soooo i definitly want to see resident evil: afterlife when it comes out  now i need people to see it with  smile 
honestly i hope that one day when you're out driving you blow a tire and then crash into a friggin ditch or a tree or something   
i'm thankful for my talents  i'm thankful for my flaws and imperfections  i'm thankful for my family  i'm thankful for my friends who've helped me  i'm thankful for the people that have hurt me  i'm thankful for the people i work with that make me smile no matter the day  i'm thankful for the mistakes i make and am going to make and if god were to take me away tomorrow i would be satisfied with the life i've lived 
finally made it to a rehearsal!  smile  annnnnnnnd i got my schedule for school  today has been nothing but amazing and now i'm going to work to top it all off 
wellll i guess i'm going to clean so i can go to this bonfire later     smile 
sooo i think i might just go lay down and listen to music before tonight gets more frustrating than it already is 
never again will i put up decorations at work    other than that today was amazing  smile 
today was abosolutely amazing! i love my job and everyone there and even some of the people that go there   smile  now i get to do homework   
i know this may come as a shock but <propfirst> boulton is not the kind loving person he appears to be  he is a jerk and a terrible friend  please pray for him 
"so i'm convinced, the only way most are going to look at you anymore is if you have no moral values, you're beyond stupid and well you'll do what ever he wants   "
"take me out to the black, tell them i ain't comin' back  burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me   "
sooo i have $100 more than what i thought i did  yay me!  smile 
borrrrrrrrred!     ugh i want to do something tonight   
i have a feeling tomorrow is going to be a terrible day    on that note i can't wait to see the e playful endables  smile 
"plans for the day: catch up on math homework  go home,clean a little bit and then take like a two hour nap  go to work until four(but not leave until five) in the morning  i just love my exciting life "
"oh jeeze, i think i find myself starting to crush on someone   "
"i'm stuck at home doing math work while my friends are at cedar point, yay me   "
so this really creepy guy just followed me out of walmart and watched me go to my car    i can honestly say i was kind of scared
"i'm off today, i'm bored and eveyone is busy so i have nothing to do     plus i really want to get my check buuutttttt i have no way of getting out there  annoyed "
i had an absolute amazing day today  smile  now i get to clean and be nagged at for the rest of the night(mom)  lol
so work definitely wasn't too great    i feel completely terrible
"work went back to being amazing, i'm happy it's back to normal   smile  excited the weekend is here because it's going to be amazing  smile "
so tonight was absolutely amazing and i had a great time   smile 
so at work this lady told me that i had a nice smile and a shining personality which was fine and dandy until she went on to say that i was a beautiful creature?    
"work was wonderful today, i love arguing with my dannybear  smile  i guess i'll do a little math and then go to bed "
so i just chased down my neighbors 100 pound husky    definitly don't want to do that one again anytime soon 
"can someone please just shoot me    i don't want to anything tomorrow, i just want to sleep  i don't want to see anyone and i really don't want to go anywhere  i can honestly say i just want to be alone but of course that won't happen "
i do not understand what i'm doing in math  i'm so friggin lost and confused and it's making me mad   
ahhh i found a corset that i really really really want    but i would have no where to wear it  annoyed 
so thanks to a certain someone i really want to watch <propfemale> and i can't find it    anywhere  annoyed 
"\i hate math with a passion so fierce that sometimes it scares me   \""- <propfemale> <propfirst>  smile """
"and we'll stay out all night 'cause rest is for the dead, 'cause tonight is like you and i so alive and too young, too young to die     smile "
so i know the right thing would be to sympathize and feel some kind of empathy for the kid but every time i look at him let a lone think about him i'm filled with all this anger and possibly even hatred that i don't even care that he's going through a hard time    but i know this is wrong and i really just don't now what to do 
<propfemale> i just got home from an amazing day with <propfirst> and now its time for a nap  smile 
i'm so happy my mom finally had a good day  she had good seats to see the browns and they actually won a game  she truly deserved today and i hope she gets more days like them soon 
so after a long talk with my mom and a much needed cry i've decided that i'm just too overwhelmed and something has to go   
sooo today was pretty interesting especially work    i got my beautiful check today so that made everything better!  laugh 
i hate it   
"oh guess who got their halloween costume today    yeah that's right, this kid!"
"oh yeah and guess who's vice president of show choir this year, this kid smile "
"well, let's see what else gets thrown my way today "
so i hate how guys say that the only thing girls do is nag and complain  we really don't and when we do it's not as bad as it's played out to be 
"<propfirst> <propmale>, i despise you and your poetry   "
"someone, anyone, please shoot me or you don't even have to shoot me you can just kidnap me  i won't fight you, i promise  i won't tell anyone who you are or where we're at  i'd make a very good hostage and do whatever you tell me to  please   "
"i promise you i'm trying, more than you know, but i'm no supergirl  it takes time to adjust and even more to shine  i have to sink before i can learn to float   "
absolute failure   
"happy sweetest day    oh wait, i have no one to say that to "
so i've completly lost sight of what i want to do with my life   
"frankly, my dear, i don't give a damn "
"already starting to get stuff ready for the play, everything is going so fast   "
i have the biggest headache ever    i don't think i've ever screamed that much 
"sooo me and my mommy are making steaks, baked potatoes, corn, and salad for dinner    and i wonder why i'm gaining weight "
omg i'm almost done with math    i honestly can't believe it 
last night was a pretty good time   smile  and i'm passing out <propfemale> later  well that or i'm going to ghost lake 
so $50 worth of <propfemale> only lasted like an hour for trick-or-treaters    i guess we have to get a hundred next year?
i don't need your understanding  i don't need to change a damn thing 
i love my job and i love the people i work with   smile  and i love the fact that i get paid tomorrow 
i hate it! i can't stop shivering   
oh i'm punching you in the nose next time i see you   
soooo i just got home from work and i get to be back there at 9 o'clock in the morning  yay me 
rage 
i love <propfirst> moxley
work at 5     i really don't have a life anymore   
i'm drowning  i'm reaching out and getting nothing  i'm angry  i'm frustrated  i'm pissed  i'm scared  i'm fucking tweaking out  i can't focus  my mind is everywhere and it's getting nowhere  i'm screaming and nothing is coming out  i can't stand the voices of the people i hold close but i can't stand not being heard by someone who cares  i don't know what to do 
ahhhhh <propmale> potter!!!!  laugh 
"i honestly can't stand the wait     midnight just needs to get here, like now!"
<propmale> potter was absolutely amazing! everyone needs to go see it as soon as you can  just not tomorrow or saturday night because you all should be at the drama club play   smile 
my big brother is home!!!!!!!!
going to get ready for the play!!!! and it's steak n' shake after!  smile 
i'll be at work tomorrow from 9 o'clock in the morning to 9 o'clock at night    yay me
people should come see me at work  you would make me happy and my day better  annnnnnnnnnd i would love you forever   smile 
now that i feel like a failure im going sit on my hour break
"with sorrow, deep sorrow, my bosom is laden  all day i go mourning in search of my love "
"sooo the rest of today is officially a bum day  i'm making a cup of hot chocolate grabbing a book and ignoring the people i really don't want to listen to  do i sound like a jerk? yeah, just a little  do i really care? not really  i will be back to my happy and chipper self later tonight   smile "
work 12-9pm
i just want to yell at someone  i just want to scream and yell until my throat is sore 
i probably just gained 5-10 pounds and i loved ever second of it   smile 
i don't wanna sit home all day    i wanna go do something
i know they say you shouldn't have to be with someone to be happy but it would really be nice when all you want to do is cuddle and be with someone who cares about all the stupid and pointless things you tell them   
yay another night alone in my creepy house    i just love it oh so much 
i love smelling good and not like tacos   smile 
do you ever have that one person that you really really just want to talk to? and then you see you have a <propmale> to talk to him but of course something happens and you can't so you get somewhat disappointed?   
i need sleep so bad right now   
"i'm so friggin cold, somebody come warm me up!"
"selah, i love you and your food  ?"
soooo it's supposed to snow all of next week and into the weekend  maybe i can get the rest of my senior pictures done  smile 
"i'm off, pretty much, all off next week    this is slightly depressing "
"who made gyros for dinner? yeah, that's right, this kid!  smile "
"hmmm should i read the odyssey or should i eat a piece of cake, which is delicious, and watch a movie?     such a hard choice "
show choir concert tonight! i have two hours to come up with a quick cute hot dance for my solo woo!
the concert was a good time and a big thank you to everyone who came   smile 
night! test in the morning   
soooo who wants to come do my work for me? it would be greatly appreciated and i'll love you forever   smile 
i wish there was a way you were able to know what are people are thinking because that would be super helpful right about now 
"i hate that i care if you care  i hate that no matter what i'm doing a thought makes its way to you  i hate the smile i get whenever we talk  i hate that it bothers me if we don't  but most of all, i hate that you don't see me the way i see you   "
"thank you, ohio and struthers high school, for screwing me out of my honors diploma    "
"nothing really planned for today, hopefully i might possibly go shopping later?"
shopping!  smile 
"oh committed, why did you have to beat my street corner?"
picked up some extra hours so now i work 3-7 i think  and i still have to find some time to go shopping today   
yeah so i definitely would like to punch someone in the nose at the moment   
"going to work in a little, i close with some of my favorite people  smile  annnnnd i got some gifts for everyone at work "
i hope that everyone has a beautiful and wonderful christmas  i hope that you are surrounded by those you love and whom love you and keep those in your heart that you can't be with on this day  god bless!
well <propfemale>'s over and after she leaves i guess i'll get ready for all the christmas  visiting 
"sooo after playing the white elephant game i received a disposable douche, an ovulation predictor, body oil, body powder, pedicure set, and some other things    gotta love christmas "
i just realized i have to be at work at 8 in the morning    not a happy camper 
yesterday i worked 9-3 and then 4-11 and got my butt kicked both shits    i now understand why people seclude themselves from everyone else 
"change in plans, going to slippery rock with my brother in the morning "
why am i such a piece?
weirdest dream ever   
"i've come to the sad, yet seemingly okay, realization that i am a bum  i've gotten nothing accomplished over my break and am now going to have to rush to get it all done shortly  go me   "

i would like to go to finland  who wants to take me?
well that was a total disaster   annoyed 
"i wonder if you even notice me? notice the way i try to get your attention  the way i try to make you smile because, well, if i had to pick my favorite thing that would be it  or maybe the way i try to look somewhat pretty when i'm around you because all i want is for you to notice   "
"so to anyone who ever wants to rent a cabin for a weekend get away or what not, you should definitely do this in advance  not last minute because it's frustrating  that is all "
"so after our two hour long read through, i think our spring play will be quite a success   smile "
\me: wow, i'm surprised she found me on facebook  i didn't even think she knew my name  this makes me happy \c3ec3b15054b707e17a0762b49067e4e,"i hate the cold and i hate the ice, but i most definitely hate the fact that it's only supposed to get worse over night "

"no super bowl party for me  i'm watching my sick, little brother "
"ohmygoodness  i wish people would stop posting up statuses every 10 minutes, especially when it's nothing but nonsense  i do not wish to know the play by play of your life "
"so this weekend is my last solo&ensemble competition, which makes me pretty sad, and i swear if i don't receive a one, in each event i'm in, i will fight a judge "
"solo&ensemble bright and early in the morning    i need high ratings for everything, i need to get them   "
"5-day getaway starting thursday! i'm so excited! we're going to be secluded out in a nice and quiet cabin with no stress, or yelling, or problems of any kind and it's going to be great  i want it to get here faster  no, let me fix that  i need it to get here faster "
"meh, i wish i could do my fafsa   "

"two pages of math down, only three more to go and then    film studies  why is this my life?"

someone please shoot me 
"so, i'm going to go for it  like this status and i'll tell you a few things that i like about you   smile "
"okay so here's a tip: if you see someone is looking pretty upset, especially if that person is generally happy, how about you leave them alone so you can avoid making it worse  thought i'd throw that out there "
just when you think you know who your friends are    such is life i suppose 
"babe, i'll always be here for you  how you respond to this is entirely up to you "
"music festival thing tomorrow, which will hopefully be a good time  the drama club play is next friday, which everyone should some see and if you come on saturday you'll get to see me ball my eyes out   smile  but in all seriousness, everyone really should come and see the it; it really is funny  i just can't believe it's all almost over "

"so a cute guy comes through the drive-thru and asks me for my number, can someone please e playful lain to me why i told him no?"
"i just watched a segment on the westboro baptist church    i wish they would come to ohio  i just don't understand how they could pervert the message of god to such an extreme measure  and also to be so ignorant in the scripture they preach, in the assumptions they make, it just blows my mind away "
"i wish my, hopefully, soon to be director would email me   "
tonight is the opening night of the drama club's leaving iowa    my last play at struthers high school  tear  annoyed 
i wish people weren't so obnoxious   
"well the first night of my last play was amazing and dinner after was hilarious    god, i'm going to miss this "
i definitely didn't think this whole get up at six in the morning to go a college visit thing through   
"tonight marked the end of my drama club career  i'll never forget the people i've met and loved  the memories i have i'll forever <propfemale>, good and bad  i want to thank every member for giving me and the other seniors the e playful erience of a life time, for giving us some kind of damned adventure  drama club was the only thing i looked forward to throughout high school and you all made every second of it just fascinating?"
"so, i teared up a bit at work when i thought about last night, good thing no one had seen me   smile "

don't you just love when a really cute pizza guy drop off your food and you look absolutely horrible? it's the greatest thing ever   
thank you for ruining my day 
"you ungrateful brat  you have a family that loves you unconditionally and would do anything for you  you get pretty much everything you ask for but i guess that isn't good enough for you  god forbid you actually have to do a bit of work to get what you want  there are over 44million children that would love to be in your place  so why don't you think about that the next time you open your mouth to complain, <propfemale> "
"my audition for college is in less than an hour  i'm freaking out but i got this  i can do this, because if i don't i have no idea what i'm going to do with my life  on that note, go me!  smile "

"of course, now that i have the <propmale> to sleep, i can't fall asleep "
"hmm, does almost honest still count?"
my mother has officially left for vacation    it's going to be a great week   smile 
"so, after tonight, i have definitely lost quite a bit of respect for a couple of people but i've definitely gained some for others "
"what happened to when you used to be humble and caring? now you're just cocky and out of control    you used to be the guy that i thought about all the time and would give anything to be with you  now, well now    i don't know what to think "
i want my prom dress   
"so, this summer is already starting to look amazing  laugh "
my mother is home! ?
why do i feel like i'm losing my friends?
"30 days, 30 confessions \confession 1 annoyed everytime i step into my shower i belt every song that pops up in my head   laugh "
"well, sorry i'm not pretty enough for you  sorry you think i could lose a few pounds  i'm sorry you're so shallow that you point out everyone's insecurities so that you can hide your own  but, let me set something straight  i know i'm beautiful, that everyone is beautiful  so you can take your fake tan and diet pills and you can go ahead and <propmale> perfection all you want i'll stay here content with my \average\"" looks"""
"30 days, 30 confessions\confession #2 annoyed i absolutely hate shoes  i wish the world went barefoot "

"30 days, 30 confessions\confession #3 annoyed i absolutely hate when people wear ugg boots with sweat pants, especially capris  i just think it looks completely ridiculous "
you truly are an asshole 
"just saying, if struthers high school even attempts to cancel prom i will cut someone  this is senior prom, one of the most important nights of my last year, hell my entire four years  you can't take that away from the senior class  and if it is canceled they will be giving me my money back for my ticket and my dress that i had made for me, for what is supposed to be the most memorable night of my high school days "
"30 days, 30 confessions\confession #4\i love the different nerdy(but not too nerdy) guys  i don't know why but i just love them   laugh "
"so this is as simple as it should be annoyed person 1- hey, i think you're cute \person 2- really? i think you're cute too \person 1- oh well maybe we should <propfemale> out sometime, get to know each other better?\person 2- yeah, that sounds great  here's my number, call me \it can truly be that simple people  so let's drop all the stupid games and silly acts and just be up front  okay?"
good thing i can't find the charger to my dead phone 
okay why are people getting im's from me bout this profile view thing? and why am i getting tagged in posts that i'm not in? this rather annoying   
i think this is the most personal i've ever allowed myself to become with a school assignment   
"hmmm do volunteer work in the morning or don't do volunteer work in the morning? decisions, decisions   "
"okay, if someone tells you to put your hat on the right way because you're working and you're not supposed to look like an asshole then just do it  and don't put it the right way and then turn it again when you think no one's looking    hate "
"i love irresponsible people who don't show up to work  but on a better note, thor comes out this week  ?"
so i got my prom dress in the mail today and it's gorgeous! i got my hair cut and also it's now straight and super soft lol it's been a pretty good day so far 
so having straight hair is definitely different    there's just so much of it 
the moment you think you have something under control is the moment you prove yourself wrong 
"chem ii, i just made you my bitch  laugh "
"just, please, tell me those few words i want to hear   "
"sooo, thor was a good time  off to bed now, so i can get ready for prom in the morning   laugh "
today was probably one of the best days that i've had at work in a long time  all thanks to the guys  and i got to see kp?
