it's amazing the emotions a song can set off   out of nowhere all of these things just come rushing back like it happened that very day   i am going to get me some sleep and hope that it's gone in the morning 
i am so done with school     and there is still two months to go  fml

i am using <propfirst>'s macbook pro to do my homework   it is so fast and easy to use   i totally need to switch and get me one of these   my laptop is so much slower that it makes me really sad   and it's light and fantastic etc etc etc
night night sleep tight!!
the fog tonight felt like a metaphor for my life 
all tcc classes are cancelled!  no school! heck yes!
"i can't wait to see what else life with you has to bring because i can't imagine this being any more amzing than it already is, and yet i know it will be "
"i'd like to thank all y'all for the birthday wishes  they were really sweet and i had such a great 23rd birthday   and a huge thanks to <propfemale>, <propmale>, mamma, & <propfirst> who did all sorts of fun things with me today   love   love   love "
i'm not sure when today got so hard but i am just hoping to pass out and that tomorrow won't be so hurtful 
i am soooo hungry   eating food    now
"i'm baking chocolate chip oatmeal cookies for <propfirst>, <propmale>, & <propfirst>' parents  nom nom nom"

my bladded is so <propfemale> tonight!!! i have peed like    3 times in the past 30 minutes   i feel your pain <propfemale> 
one day i'll be a real boy
when people think of me i want for them to get a clear picture of who i am in their minds   i don't want to be blurry   i don't want to be hazy   i want to be defined and crisp 
my brain is done and therefore i have given up on studying for my chem final tomorrow and this terrifies me   wish me luck   i'm scared i'll need it 
done with bio journal article review and now for a little relaxation by playing uno with <propfirst> and <propfirst>   weee!!
yays! i have some grades! i have a ballin a in oceanography with me getting a 101 on the final   in biology i got a straight up b for the final and the course   in chemistry i got a b on the final and a c for the year   i'm positive i got an a in math   feels like a bangin semester to me!
oh my for reals  i just set my facebook to english (pirate) under languages    let me tell you    this is some serious nonsense fun
*sigh* time to go home i guess  i am leaving this last message on <propfirst>' macbook before i hit the road   i might not be back here til the new year  *dislike*
"so this is the new year\i don't feel any different\the clanking of crystal\e playful losions off in the distance\\so this is the new year\and i have no resolutions\for self assigned penance\for problems with easy solutions\\so everybody put your best suit or dress on\let's make believe that we are wealthy for just this once\lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn\as thirty dialogues bleed into one"
"i've needed this rain  i'm not sure why, but now that it's here i can feel it washing away the pressures of the holidays "
why am i not feeling so great today? started feeling unwell around lunch and tonight i am all blah for reals   i didn't even finish my dinner 
i hate this ridiculousness going on with my textbooks   the biology books i had for the first semester won't work for my second semester   are you kidding me!? i now have to spen another $300 for books for just one semester!?  i hate college 
being bored is bad for my wallet  itunes is eating my money 
i don't have much to do tomorrow  aka i have nearly nothing to do tomorrow  i have to find something   
my classes are already up on blackboard   yeah! and i've already done an assignment for my online class already and the semester hasn't even officially started   look at me all jumping the gun 
"i am going over my school stuff and my history teacher requires my works cited to be in \chicago style\"" and not mla   are you kidding me? i don't even know what that is!"""
theres so many wars we fought theres so many things we're not but with what we have i promise you that we're marchin on we're marchin on
tomorrow  tomorrow    it's keeping me from sleeping   great    smile 
i am excited to be off on friday   i think it'll be great to get some sleep 
this is why i hate online homework    fourth time trying to get things straightened out with the service so that i can do my homework before it is due 
i need somebody to either a) do my homework for me  b) work for me and give me the money and discount  c) support me so i can focus on school 
it's a beautiful snowcovered morning here at crossways 
i need a new rim for my front driver's side  anybody know where i can find a used nissan versa steel wheel? i can't afford a new one from the dealership 
how is that i look at a selection of items and the one i want is always the most e playful ensive one or second most e playful ensive?
i want to be able to wear offensive flair on my apron 
still trying to bring my iphone back to life  i hope my tears falling all over it are helping  just kidding on that last part  my tears aren't going anywhere near my iphone 
lost blows and i hate you all for making my evening even worse for not being able to get away from it   keep it to yourself 
today the guy who is a bounty <propmale> in my public speaking class was wearing a scarf so much better than i ever could   it has me concerned with my status as a semi well dressed individual 
i hate the world today you're so good to me i know but i can't change tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe i'm an angel underneath innocent and sweet yesterday i cried must have been relieved to see the softer side i can understand how you'd be so confused i don't envy you i'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one
soooo    who is going to buy me a macbook to replace my dying <propfemale>? any takers? you know i'm worth it!
"i am a giant bucket of epic fail this morning   as it turns out the article that i got to school early to work on isn't due until wednesday  and instead of the four labs we were supposed to do (16,17,18, & 21) i did 16,17,18, & 19  i am becoming more and more tarded    i swear "
i just realized that at some point my fun died  i'm entertaining and all but i haven't been really truely fun in a long time and that realization makes me really sad  i wonder when my fun died 
good morning y'all  time to go back to school  woo 
i am sooooo glad i got an extension on my trig homework   it's not due til tomorrow but i am working on it tonight to prepare for my test  aka i am miserable haha

"it's spring fever   that is what the name of it is   and  when you've got it, you want - oh, you don't quite know what it is you do  want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want it so!  ~mark  twain"

i whip my hair back and forth
why am i awake? i was happily sleeping about ten minutes ago  there's no reason for me to be awake  as a matter of fact i've only gotten four hours and thirty minutes of sleep  this just ain't right 
my teacher uses the same examples and says the same things literally every class 
i can't wait to see me brother  it's been too long since he now lives in ct 
oh facebook  sorry that i've forgotten about you and neglected you  i'll make it up to you eventually 
"i love opening, but weekday opening shifts make me miss <propfemale> "

celebrating my last hour of being 23 with my own special hot chocolate recipe 
i just realized that today is my last opening shift at crossways  i'm starting to get teary-eyed 
"thank you all so very much for the birthday wishes on my 24th birthday  it has been an amazing year for me with all of you in it, and i can't wait to see what this next one brings "
i can't believe how empty my room is right now  85% of my life will be packed up in boxes and bins as of tonight 
flat tire in the trailer with all of my stuff in it  45 minute delay  fml at least we're in an area with lots of stores 
oh macbook pro   you make my heart sing with ease and joy
