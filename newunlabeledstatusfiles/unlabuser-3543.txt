"today was a sad day for we lost a wonderful, loving brother too the long sleep of death   vic had a kind heart and a wonderful personalty   i consider myself blessed that i was able to call him one of my close friends "
"in a sea of mundane brothers, vic stood out as a shinning example of how a true christian brother loves, acts and is committed to his congregation and to the ones he loves   i truly wish that when i reach his age that others look to me as i and everyone that knew vic looked to him "
even though his death saddens us to the core we must remember that we will see him again in paradise and he should be one more reason to make sure we are there as well   for i know that i will be anxiously waiting to embrace my good friend again and to share in the good times like we did in the past
