ringing in the new year while drinking for free at palms!  enjoying our last few days in vegas   gonna be crazy not living down the street from the biggest adult playground in the world 
woke up    turned my tv on    it was on a jersey shore marathon    these people are idiots    and i can't stop watching    i hate myself a little right now 
finally got on the facebook bus   need some face pics

off to work 
trying to have a relaxed night at home   not working too well 
"your values is a disarray prioritizin' horribly   unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss poor morally   ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin, and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?"
"\dose <propfirst> merriman gotta choke a bitch?!?\"" idiot """
"raider's d looked good    smile   jamarcus <propfirst> still sucks    sad  either way, good game "
"i can't stand <propmale> mayweather jr   he talks so much shit about mma, then weighs in two pounds over-weight for his fight tomorrow   i hope he fights pacquiao soon and gets his ass whooped "
"for those of you who don't already know, here's my plans  moving back to the bay in <propfirst>  with <propfirst> for about a year, then to la around dec  2010  can't wait to see my friends and family in the bay   to my so cal friends, <propfirst> and i will be down there soon enough  vegas has been incredible but we're ready to move on   still got a few months out here though   who's gonna come party with us in the mean time?"
one of the e playful os at yard house was putting the tomato bisque away last night and i saw that he was about to drop it   i was getting ready to point and laugh at him then the tomato bisque hit the ground and splashed all over me   insta-karma 
"3 am, wide awake   this sucks "
is it january yet?
"so, i am just getting over my hangover from last night   long night    longer day after    had a great time though!"
"in an incredibly selfish way we are all sad and depressed that you are no longer with us   with that being said, i am so happy that you get to see your boys again and that you have no more pain   tell everyone we love and miss them   rest in peace aunt <propfemale> "
dis-likes the new facebook layout 
fedor   unbelievable 
hope couture gets back on the winning track and pacquiao handles business   great night for fighting!!!
"both <propfirst> and myself are really, really sick   was in a lot of pain   the biggest upside?  laying in bed with my beautiful gf and our incredible dog while we get better   things are looking up already "
"so much change is coming, which will lead me to so much familiar coming back into my life, which i hope leads to more changes and many steps forward   it's a giant oxymoron, and i love it!  can't wait to see how the next three months play out "
"just watched \notorious\"" again   hurts every time """
"it was empty   only about 1 4 of the shops were open, and it's actually really small, but the architecture and designs were pretty sick "
new years can't come soon enough 
our last sunday night at body english before they shut down    sad   guess they found out we were moving and just decided to pack it in   lol  wish we could take hard rock with us when we move 
can't stand <propmale> mayweather jr   he's scared to fight someone that may be able to beat him so he is looking for a way out   i hope this fight happens   i've been wanting to see pacquiao knock him around for a while now 
here's to hoping that working late on new years <propfemale> is a sign that big $$$ will be coming my way in 2011!  happy new years everyone!!!
