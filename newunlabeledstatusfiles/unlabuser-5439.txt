feeling tired and has a little bit of a headache!!!
myspace music has gone downhill   i'm trying to search for some dance electronica and the only music browsing features is the charts   i want to dig deep into a certain genre and where is the comprehensive genre list   that was good and the search for local bands   this is not another version of <propfemale>  lame

"wishes that there is a pandora type thing for picking women   they send you women and you rate them if you like them or not, and then they keep suggesting women that you like, not random chicks   hot and not and daily babe should be like that "
"the lhc has been fired up again   it will be ready to smash these particles at near light speed this january   so don't obsess on christmas this year because we are all doomed    this is way earlier than 2012   aaaaaaaaaaaugh!!!!  lol!!!  really, it is safer to cross the street than have this thing collide particles"

oh gosh    <propfirst> sounds so horrible on the piano   she needs some lessons!!
"your profile is not going to be deleted because of overpopulation of facebook   that happened on myspace a couple of years ago and it also happened as an generic e-mail chain back around the 1990s or something like that saying the internet is overpopulated   so don't listen to that one, it is just another chain letter "
had a pretty kickass presentations in computer apps class   
"got my classes all arranged for next semester   there is going to be a lot of shit going on here   i will be a studying monk but at least it will be something i'll enjoy, since i'm usually on the computer anyway, so might as well learn about it "
"is not for everyone   please talk to your doctor when you start e playful eriencing nauesa, vomiting, nasal congestion, unsteady walk, changes in personality, excessive horniness   this should be an internet meme"
finally got done with another test on data communications   time to move on and learn about wans and lans and that shit   pretty soon i'll get ip addressing and protocols by heart 
my ip address right at the clc library with this node is 134 29 212 12 with a subnet mask of 255 255 0 0 as an class b ip address which is getting the internet from the server at the university down in the cities   non it professional or network admin or somebody that is not a geek   who cares!!!

"a good way to increase your gpa   go hack into the server, get into the gradebook and throw some d's on this bitch!"
is not sure if he should ask <propfirst> out   she is a nice girl but i wonder if she is my type   i am feeling kinda pressured and i am not sure if i am ready for this  smile 
"yeah we should support the redheads   not bash them   they are not as rare as you think they are and they are not going to be extinct by the year 2100, even though there is a lot of men are liking more of the interracial relationship, so that may increase the demand for redheads even higher this century   some redheads are pretty so if you find one , date one!"
the lhc started collisions and we are still alive   yay!!!
i'm so fly yy yy yyy yy yy yy yy yy yy yy
yo i'm a balla
thinks  this  <propfirst> beiber could qualify for the next <propmale> ossman   he just sounds like <propmale> ossman unless he teams up with somebody like <propfemale> or the pussycat dolls
"i'll be home for thanksgiving, you can plan on that, please have turkey and pumpkin pie, and taking a long nap   all that stuffing will find me, i can eat these potatoes with glee   lets give thanks to all the things we need, and splurge the money with greed "
pretty much a wasted day in class   all it is way review from a test   at least i got a c on my data comm test   whoooo!!!

"rock is not dead    it is not featured on top 40 as much as it used to be and it never did   rock was more for people who like albums, going to shows, and downloading streaming off the internet   there is still some good bands out there like bullet for my <propfirst> "

"facebook is starting to get boring   looks like a lot of people i know are not on my news feed anymore, just younger people"
 sad 
can't wait to put on the yule log and 24 hours of the christmas story   it is hard to choose
saw one of santas helpers walking down 5th street in aitkin   there was literally a guy with a red suit
aitkin got beautiful christmas lights this years   especially around the se end of town
