"putting someones happiness above your own  trying to make them happy at the cost of your own  i only say i'm stupid cause i want to do it, not because i do "
"don't relize how much you depend on someone until they are gone, i thought i liked having <propfemale> around, then she left  now i realize i need her around  miss you <propfemale>, hurry up and visit "
"for the first time in a long time, i am terrified of what is going to happen  i already hurt from something that hasn't even happened yet, and it's killing me "
"don't know what i'm even hoping for anymore  that's a lie, i know exactly what i'm hoping for  don't know why i'm stupid enough to keep hoping for it "
in the <propfemale> city for a weekend with my dad and little bro  litterally my brother from another mother

"i don't like you cause you treat me like shit, i like you despite that you treat me like shit "
