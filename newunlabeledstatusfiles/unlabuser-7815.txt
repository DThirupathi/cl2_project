"spent the day dodging the rain and so i took <propmale> to see land of the lost today   although there were some funny parts, i felt like this should have been rated r   it is really not for children because of the adult comedy that is involved "

kind of scared   a tornado is brewing only a few <propmale> away
"last night at bmx <propmale> placed 4th   he would have placed higher but another kid spun out in front of him and then <propmale> ran over his belly!  the poor kid   i pray to god that <propmale> never gets hurt like that   but, i can guarantee that kid will come ba"
