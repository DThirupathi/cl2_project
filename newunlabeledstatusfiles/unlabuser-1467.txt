hey im grounded and i dont have my phone call me on my house phone at 303-678-8468 if ya want to talk to me
why can't there be one guy to show me that there not all the same 
"everyone sees who i appear to be, but only a few know the real me, you can only see what i choose to show you, there is so much more    you just don't know"
p l u r that is how we roll lol
never leave the one you love for the one you like cuz they will leave you for the one they love and you will have no one there
"cuz your everything to me no question asked, i mean to you what you mean to me and the world don't mean a thing, so hold on tight and lets go for the ride of your life  (new song idea lol)"
for the first time in a long time i can say i'm turelly happy with him
"i only appear to be what i want other people to see but there is only a few who know the real me, so much more you don't even know"
"i love him with all my heart i'll love him tell death due us aprat, he is the reason for living the light in the sky i love him so much "
"ever understand body language, cuz mine is on fire but you'll never know it  joyful "
i really thought you were the one i was going to be with for a long time but i guess i was wrong  im just not willing to get hurt anymore  i can't
remember when getting high meant swinging on the playground?your worst enemies were your siblings race issues were who ran the fastest  war was just a card game and the only drug you knew was cough medicantion when wearing skirt didn't make you a slut  the most pain you felt was skinned knees goodbyes were only until tomorrow? and we couldn't wait to grow up 
"why can't one thing just work out the way i want it to, just one thing would be freking fantastic!"
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind    for me it happens all the time 
omg!!! i hates these things with a passion!!
"for some reason i really want to hit something, i wonder why( fucking people!!)"
"you want to find out who all your true friends are fall down and mess everything up and see who will still be standing there by your side, i did i have the best sister  in the world because of it "
you  know the worst part about being lied to is not the fact they lied but knowing you weren't worth the truth
"friday night we are getting a group to go see <propfemale> in wonderland, who's up for it let me or <propfemale> know"
"maybe it is true maybe we don't know what we have until we've lost it, but maybe its also true that we don't know what we're missing until we find it"
"i'm the kind of girl who will dance in the pouring rain, smile like i'm fine when i'm not  make you laugh when you want to cry  worry more about you then me, fall over laughing at the dumbest things, always forgive but never forget, who loves so many and hates so few, when she's hated by so many and loved by few"
when i tell you i love you i dont say it out of habit or to start a conversation i say it to remind you that your the best thing that ever happened to me
"i don't know where i stand with you & i dont know what i mean to you all i know is everytime i think of you, all i wanna do is be with you"
"some say that holding on makes you stronger, but sometimes it takes much more stregth to let go and move on"
old enough to know better     young enough to do it anyways
"what is this thing you call \normal\""?!?!?is it contagious!? omg!!! don't touch me i might get your normal!!"""
i can't hold on anymore    i'll let you go but ill never forget its time to let go    
"love me without fear, trust me without doubt, love me without restrictions, want me without demand, aceppt me how i am"
so tired today all i want to do is sleep
what hurts the most: saying something you wish you hadn't or not saying something you wish you had 
"so today kalin is staying the night, tomorrow i not sure, sunday chile picnic( it will be awesome) then only a few more days until school is over           i'm so happy right know you just don't understand"

"there's no point in staying with someone who doesnt even know your alive anymore, there's no point in trying when all you do fall back, but when you have the world in your hand you also have the paths to make   you make life it doesnt make you, you can make it what you want or it ain't your life, your just living there"
