"letting go  part 1  to let go doesnâ€™t mean to stop caring, it means i canâ€™t do it for someone else to let go is not to cut myself off, itâ€™s the realization that i canâ€™t control another  to let go is not to enable, but to allow learning from natural consequences   to let go is to admit powerlessness which means the outcome is not in my hands  to let go is not to care for, but to care about "
"part 2 to let go is not to fix, but to be supportive to let go is not to judge, but to allow another to be a human being  to let go is not to be in the middle arranging all the outcomes, but to allow others to effect their own outcomes  to let go is to to be protective, it is to permit another to face reality  to let go is not  to deny but to accept "
"part 3 to let go is    not to nag, scold or argue, but to search out my own shortcomings and to correct them   is not to adjust everything to my desires, but to take each day as it comes, and to <propfemale> the moment   is not to criticize and regulate anyone, but to try to become whatever dream i can be   is not to regret the past, but to grow and live for the future   is to fear less and to love more "
why is everything so small!!!!
"so let me get this straight - <propfirst> <propmale> is getting his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for a 9th time, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods are screwing everything, yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage?? really?? ***feel free to copy and paste if you agree   i did"

the most important thing in my life is     what's left of it!
