"so if i hadn't jumped the gun and gotten a phone that is huge and flip phone and old but it works,, i could have a brand new phone    all i had to do was be home  what the hell?? and was extremely sick this morning and was late for school     getting sick doesn't count as an excuse unless you drive home, be more late, then get a note and return    how dumb lol    life"
everybody needs to be loved  making fun of people isn't cool because everyone that you may pass has to live their life just as you do yours  so next time you start to say something about someone think first and decide not too  and listen to friends because they may be going through something that they can't get over and need someone to care  just sayin so   good night  -august
