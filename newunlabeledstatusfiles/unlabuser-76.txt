why do periods have to hurt so much! i feel like punching a puppy in the face right now d:
"ugh! my period's worse, i have a stomach virus and on top of that if i try to get out of work tonight i'll lose my job! why me!?"
oh thank goodness for the new hostess! now i can sleep this crappy virus off!
i really need someone to talk to right now  sad 
i think it might be time to start looking for a new job- particularly one without an airplane theme      
"man, i slept good last night     maybe too good because now i wanna sleep all day! oh wait- work at 5 surprise 0      poopy        x x"
