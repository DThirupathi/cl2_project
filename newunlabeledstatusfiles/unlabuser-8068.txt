tryna hit the studio 2nite
"working on my song \2nd last chance\"" today -  thanking god for letting me be able to do what i do"""
"how do you fix a love un-done? how do even know u fit to love someone? and when u decide to take that ride, can u drive from the passenger side? 1 wheel in the middle 4 hands on it - 2 sets of breaks u decide to slam on it - got damn women where the love go?"
"when your love is lost, your whole worlds thrown off- when the one you need dont need you, what do you do when love is lost?"
"love aint suppose to feel this way, love aint suppose to hurt or cause me pain, love aint suppose to make me cry, but now im tryna wipe my eyes - im hatin love"
now im on the grind like some badd breaks- cuz i remember the time i was last place- im the realist can u feel it - never have to tell me get up off ya ass <propmale>
you call it hypin urself up - i call it street dreaming
tryna hit the studio 2nite - gotta alot on my mind - ive been blessed with this voice  so immah sing
