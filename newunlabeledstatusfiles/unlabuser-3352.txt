"thanks mc <propfirst>, now i want to listen to the suicide sonata   "
"140 to 116, i win!!"
it's utterly amazing how many people can be mad at you for doing what you need to do to make yourself a better person and happier with those around you 
"this weekend, just \does not compute\"" at all   """
i just had the worse nightmare i've had in years   
"how can one love someone, and be happy with them, only to turn around in less than twenty four hours, and tell them they don't love you like you love them? then why think out the options of our lives together? why be happy in love with me and consider everything you want to consider- then turn around in less than a day, and say- the way you love me, i love him? and yet you were happy with me   "
hello october    i have missed you 
"i am happy again, cause i is    thank you everyone who let me vent, and was kind  i am in a good mood again    and did i mention i love octobers!!  special thanks to <propfirst> <propmale>, our discussion earlier allowed me to use the advice dispensed to me by <propfemale> <propfirst> moore, thank you both!!!  my two best friends and best council i could ask for!!"
yeah- but then this happened     sad 
"as much as i would like, i would like to take a step back, and just listen with my eyes, and watch with my ears    and yes i did say that right   i just wish    i just wish that i could talk to you again   like we used to before all this bull shit   baby steps and a delicate touch with a slight finesse, and maybe    a fresh start   just need to stop and smell the music   "

"i like you, but seriously, what  the  fuck?!"
"writing a letter    starts: dear <propfemale>,  hey   how are you? -- that's all i got    i can't even write a frakking letter    i used to crack out 20 <propfemale> letters like nothing, now i can't even write one    ugh!?"
"hey, you, the one who watches- i am going to start calling you the watcher \anyways, watcher- i know you watch this <propfemale>, and i know you watch my blog   are you trying to see when i finally decide to stop caring?  good luck   you'll be waiting a while, <propfemale> chÃ©rie    a really long while "

"all that left is to hook up the systems, and organize my books, games, and movies    this could be a while    oh, and a couple of little tasks too: laundry to put away, dishes to wash, trash out, boxes destroyed- and ill finally have an apartment   lol  laugh "
