"teachers' hefty salaries are driving up taxes, and they only work 9 or 10 months a year  it's time we put things in perspective and pay them for what they do - babysit! we can get that for less than <propfemale>imum wage that's right  let's give them $3 00 an hour and only the hours they worked; not any of that silly planning time, or any time they spend before or after school  that would be $19 50 a day (                        7:45 to 3 surprise 0 pm with 45 <propfemale>  off for lunch and planning-- that equals 6 1 2 hours)  each parent should pay $19 50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children  now how many students do they teach in a day   maybe 30? so that's $19 50 x 30 = $585 00 a day  however, remember they only work 180 days a year  i am not going to pay them for any vacations  let's see     that's $585 x 180= $105,300 per year  what about those special education teachers and the ones with master's degrees? well, we could pay them <propfemale>imum wage ($7 75), and just to be fair, round it off to $8 00 an hour  that would be $8 x 6 1 2 hours x 30 children x 180 days = $280,800 per year  wait a <propfemale>ute    the average teacher's salary (nation wide) is $50,000  $50,000 180 days = $277 77 per day 30 students=$9 25 6 5 hours = $1 42 per hour per student--a very ine playful ensive baby-sitter and they even educate your kids! make a teacher smile; repost this to show appreciation for all educators"
