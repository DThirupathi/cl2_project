"dear loving friends & family, thanks so much for all of your prayers & for the notes  it does mean a lot that people are taking the time to communicate with us  makes us feel less alone  god is good! <propfemale> is now out of the hospital & at home  she has a long way to go, to get back to her normal, but we are doing our best to trust god \\thanks for praying & i will keep you all updated!"
"just a quick update on how <propfemale> is doing, but first i want to thanks all of you who have been praying for <propfemale> & our family  thanks for the notes as well  i have literally gotten notes from all over the usa & the world  it really is amazing to know that god is hearing the petitions for my daughter from all over the the world  so, thanks!"
"so, anyway, here is the update:tuesday night at about 8 smile 0 <propfemale> was discharged from pullman regional hospital & we took her home  she was still unable to support her own weight & she could not use either of her hands very well  the doctor's didn't know what was wrong & wanted us to get in touch with children's hospital in seattle "
"we talked with her dr  (dr  <propfemale> richardson - who is amazing by the way) wednesday & we decided that <propfemale> would be admitted into children's on monday morning (oct  25)  <propfemale> is slowly (very slowly) improving, but she still can't walk without complete assistance, she gets tired easily & she can't read, because she can't focus "
"her left hand has improved, but she still can't grip a glass that has liquid in it very well  while at children's, they will be looking for neurological damage that has not been previously discovered as well as putting her through extensive physical & occupational therapy "
"<propfemale> is emotionally doing pretty well but is, for obvious reasons, depressed  she is trusting god, but also angry with god  but, god can handle that! we as a family are doing ok, but it is tough being separated again "
<propmale> still has school & sports 7 we want to make sure he is not getting forgotten with all this going on  please keep praying for us  <propfemale> & i need wisdom  thanks!
