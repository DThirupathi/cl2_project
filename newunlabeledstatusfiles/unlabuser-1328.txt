"\it's better to help people than a garden gnome \"" it's not everyday that i find a character i can relate to as much as amÃ©lie poulain   love """
"love makes us weak  but when is anything ever that simple? opening up to them, making ourselves vulnerable to them speaks volumes of how special they are to us  and i guess in a paradoxical sort of way it makes us stronger too since it takes strength to let down our guard like that  ugh! love is too complicated to talk about like this     annoyed "
found out the brakes on my bike arent working (dont worry i wasnt near the road at the time) so ill just settle for taking a walk instead   smile
