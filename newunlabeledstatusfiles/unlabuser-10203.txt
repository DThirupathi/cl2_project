6th through 12th grade they said \colleges don't use apa," so we're gonna teach you guys mla and mla only\"" \"d0187d2faed8b387efd33a94e62c086e,gotta go ace a bio midterm real quick
schrÃ¶dinger's cat walks into a bar     and doesn't 
"my bananas went from green to green-brown   \\what the hell "
the a clockwork orange reference on south park last night was amazing 
"internet! it's been two days, that's two too many "
"define the word \universe\"" and give 3 examples """
hmmm    staying up late on a night before a midterm writing about philosophy instead of studying 
anyone else in mirkwood lose internet for a minute or so there?
"no matter how hard you try, you will never find a song name cooler than \watch where you're <propfirst> walken\"" """
2 hour naps that just make you more tired are very disappointing 
tf2 is officially reinstalled  now to pray my abhorrent graphics card can somehow manage to run a 3 year old game 
went to hokkaido for lunch    love that restaurant 
what an une playful ected and totally unforeseen crash 
"continuing student housing for 2011-122011-12 student housing online application window opens at7 surprise 0 a m , monday, november 15\apply online at https annoyed  my housing uci edu gateway \\lol not really"

just hindu it 
"why must they always host loud events just outside of mirkwood?\\why!?!?!?!?"
woke up at 4 smile 0 pm  mirkwood record?
"italian ice when it's this temperature? am i crazy? no, just bold "

i should probably skim through those 300 or so pages of psych that make up all the test material on our final in two days 
"1 down, 3 to go; i love finals week"
just overheard some girl saying \so like," polar or nonpolar has to with the charge?\""\"d0187d2faed8b387efd33a94e62c086e,i find it funny that people need to forcefully cut themselves off fb for finals > >
"note to self: attempting to cultivate a \finals week beard\"" only results in shame and pathetic failure when your facial hair grows as slowly as moss """

"funniest part of the day? \this is my favorite position!\"""""
all these online class resources are really annoying    especially when you end up having more than you have actual classes   
i should never be up early enough to have to wait for pippin to open   
a woman babbling in chinese    and i thought my new voicemail would be important 
stupid mandatory new profile switch    i dislike it

"woo, back to pq this weekend"
"great day  not only did my car breaking down turn a 1 hour trip home into a 3 hour trip home, but the engine is probably ruined forever "
skipping bio is a great feeling 
i love when your chem teacher doesn't teach you anything at all about the online homework 
"16 hours of work straight except for food breaks and still not quite done with stuff due tomorrow \\fun "
always great when your alarm mysteriously doesn't go off and you walk in to your 50 minute chem midterm 35 minutes late 
listening to animals by pink <propmale> all the way through for the first time in a while is great 
"so, the girl with the dragon tattoo was good  not super cheery though "
