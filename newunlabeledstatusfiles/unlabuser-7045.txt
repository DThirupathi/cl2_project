happy new year  i'm sick  i'm losing my voice and sound like a 13 year old boy  it's smexy  <propfirst> leaves monday so i pray this isn't anything that will knock me out  whine 
so much packing to do   no drive to do it  
now the kidlets are sick too  yeeehaw 
"i would tongue kiss my shiny new cable interwebs if i weren't afraid of getting it sick  fairwell, dsl, you suck at internetting "
trying to become motivated  
suhg 
holy crap did we get a lot of snow  it's still coming down too  the kids are giddy 
season finale of <propmale> = sjkalgdrsuyfgdgbghf
we went to cafe evolution and bought three things of sheese  i am giddy  over fake cheese 
"so, there was like massive arson activity in my neighborhood last night, which is super awesome  only two people died, but they just *happened* to be my step mom's family members  <propfemale>, we won't be sleeping tonight  anyone want to hellp me for a millitia? northampton millitia  that sounds really not threatening "
"we didn't burn to death, so that's good "
"dear fb, <propfemale> palin sucks  i'm not sure why you think her and i are bffs, but i don't like seeing her face when i log in  thanks "
the kids are already crying for dadda  this is going to be fun 
"day one (mostly) over and done with  the kids are snug in bed  <propfemale> had a giant painting with her own spit fest today for some reason, but otherwise we survived the day unscathed  now i just need to stop being sick so i can go grocery shopping "
we left the house today and it went well  i got some faux chicken marinara things from the c surprise p made with daiya and they look yummy  now i'm dizzy and tired  the end
pink
"feeling moopsy  the whole aloney thing is setting in and i don't like it  i need to stop being sick  it's been like over a week  on a positive note, the kids are starting to adjust and have been <propmale> better  so yay  smile "
is insanely bored 
"dear bed, stop being so comfy and warm and or magically make my kids sleep until 11   and then magically make me not get out of said warm bed and make sure they're living and accidentally wake them up and ruin it "
the kids are still awake and i'm feeding them pizza and fries  parenting fail 
it's pouring rain and 55 out  it smells like spring  i wish it really were!
today is a moopsy day 
please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who has been eaten by dragons  my wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of  dragons are nearly unstoppable and    are truly terrifying  93% won't copy and paste this    they have been eaten by dragons 
spent most of last night in the hospital with kahlil  we were both pukies so much  they gave us ivs and anti-nausea meds and it helps a lot  this morning i stepped on my glasses and broke them in half  hmph 
"fell asleep at like 7 smile 0 and i've been awake since like 3 smile 0  whoops  luckily it means that i'm just not sick enough to sleep that long  feeling much better this morning, but my lack of glasses is making me frustrated "
"dear fb, you are effing up my computer  thanks "
"not to be all wah wah wah, but today i missed my appointment to get glasses because i locked us all out of the house with no car keys and no cell phone  the next available appointment is in more than a month  a fucking month  i feel screaming coming on "

my car is making me caricidal 
i am officially turning to polygamy to devote my love to my new <propmale> studio stick 
"dear right hand,     please stop making me look like i smoke crack                                                                                     love,                                                                                        love  <propfemale>  love "
"deals & steals ftw  two full bags of groceries for $10 50, can't really beat that "
"fyi, it's difficult to shop for <propfemale> ears on etsy for your five year old without feeling unclean afterward  why must everything on earth be tainted with icky?"
akua is dancing to hhc in the living room and <propfemale> is yelling at me to turn it off  they are so much like myself and <propfirst> that it makes me giggle sometimes 
feeling nostalgic and moopsy  i miss fun 
uhhgg snow storm  no wonder i woke up to a dream about satan 
my baby is five today  how did this happen?
does anyone know if it's worth seeing <propfemale> in imax?
got an iphone today yaaay
"as it turns out, it wasn't worth seeing alive in imax  i did enjoy it though  also, <propfirst> leaves in a few hours and i am painfully moopsy"
it's supposed to be nearly 60 out the next two days! then it's supposed to get colder and dump buckets of rain on us for the rest of the week   
"fyi, wasabi does not feel so fab in your sinuses  avoid that "
i'm all manic and buzzy and can't sleep  boo 
i can't stop shivering!!!
i am wiped out and totally happy about that  yay spring!
"how in the world are ear buds supposed to be comfortable? maybe i have extra <propfemale> ear holes, but ow "
i've set out to do nothing today after a week solid of doing crap  it's noon and i'm already twitching 
i'll add to my word roster  i am officially sick  bleehh
chewing my nails and spacing out at the wall 
my grandma is literally stalking me 
"dying my hair pink  i missed you, pink hair   love "
"<propfemale> is on a big trying to make akua into a burrito kick today  just now she was rolling him up in a blanket and singing to him, \you're my <propfemale> burriiittooo i'm going to cook you up sppeeeeedooo  you will be so deliciiicooouus i love you my <propfemale> burriiittooo!\"" """
"it is inhumanely muggy  i really hoped to wake up to a nice, cool morning after last night  dear central air, i miss you "
"oh caffeine, why must you make me ill? i could really use you right about now "
thaannkkss guyths
so essited to spend my birthday cleaning  i am soooo sleepypampts!
waiting at the airport  hope i'm in the right place  confidential 
today = lame 
"ooops i got fat again  tomorrow i start tracking again  i'm hoping that if i say it here, i'll actually do it  someone please come live with me and guilt me into eating right "
"the humidity today is ridiculous  on the bright side, i picked up a cute pair of summery wedges for like $3 and change at target "
today is weird 
"someone help me connect to this freaking irc chat on my iphone!!! it says i have the wrong password, but i triple checked and it's a liar!"
"dear eyes, please open willingly and without delay  i am too tired to fight with you "
i just fell asleep for what felt like forever  seriously out cold  it felt amazing  it was only like ten minutes though  now i just want a real nap  tease!
ready to move 
just binged on blackberries  it was not a good choice 
i am strongly dissatisfied with the new version of the my little pony seaponies  i'm dying to go dig around my dad's basement 
anyone in western <propfemale> happen to know a good babysitter who can do weekday afternoons once or twice a week?
anyone want to buy my brand new iphone for $200 toward the end of the month?
sleep eludes me  boo 
"i'm not normally big on the emo posts, but today today is lame  it would make my life immeasurably less difficult if i could get just an *ounce* of support  why am i shouldering everyone else's drama and babysitting adults when i'm just trying to get through the day with my own problems? the end "
"dear att, get your shiz together  i want my damn iphone 4 "
just preordered my shiny new iphone 4  i did it for the toads 
"yaaayyy, poison <propfemale>!"
i had to get a new phone number  let me know if you want it and haven't already gotten it 
"dear sick, please go away instead of *kind of* getting better and then getting worse in new and fun ways "
this heat can kindly eff off and die 
bleh 
had a nice time on the cape  on our way back now 
meh 
"dear roofers, i know youre just doing your job, but i kind of wish a massive thunderstorm upon you  (also, my keyboard wont let me press the apostrophe key  it makes it go to \quick search\""  wtf)"""
i just watched like six hours of glee  there is something very wrong with me 
the c surprise p started carrying these vegan cheese crackers they sell on vegan essentials and i am a little bit in love  they also started carrying daiya finally!
"i was so pretty today!! we went to the fair, then the playground, then to the c surprise p, and i am now worn out  also, i am going to break in to the fair tonight and steal bunnies "
pretty sure my tap water has an abnormally high level of bacteria  all of my bettas have gotten ill with various bacterial infections no matter how well the water is kept  i am making a last ditch effort and switching to bottled water like i did the last time i lived in this apartment(and had all my tanks crash out of nowhere with bacterial infections   hrrmm)  it worked last time   here's to hoping 
<propfemale>'s first day of school  she grabbed a friend and more or less blew us off from there  hahah
"ashas first day went well! she and the girl in the pic i posted earlier were all hugging on each other  she forgot i packed gym shoes for her, but she says everything else was good    getting specifics is like pulling teeth  also, my apostrophe\ button is forcing me to go to search again so i cant use it  i do not approve "
it's odd being dressed and done with my errands at 10am 
it is an absolutely stunning day
would it be wrong to smack a five year old?
"dear 9am, you are boring "
"i just got this e-mail, sent from \me\"": \",8fce90beb1bb214770d88be08c5fe7cb,<propfemale> has an ear infection  boo 
kombucha = carbonated vinegar = the opposite of noms 
snore 
i don't waaannna go outside!!! 28 effing degrees man  that's no joke  i need a winter coat 
today can end now  i would be sincerely ok with this 
i don't waaannnaaa
i am thankful to be home 
i seriously could not be happier that it's the weekend  this week just dragged on and on and on 
clean all the things?  sad 
wiinnnttteeerrrr!! why oh why!? i don't want to lose my face and have to wear a silicone face  please don't make me  kiss (
"i am a sleeping late ninja  i don't know how i managed to get <propfemale> to school on time, but i pretty much rock   and have unbrushed hair  but my point still stands "
why am i still awake?
"i should really learn to stop going to bed at 8pm  without the internet, my sleep schedule is even more effy  i don't know what i would do without my phone "
apparently sleep was not to be had for either <propfemale> or i since about midnight  i guess i'll get my shopping done when akua wakes up and then take a nap?
aaannnndd <propfemale>'s sick  i really needed foods too  feh  i need my husband back  life is very inconvenient without a live in hand 
wrap all the things?  sad 
ahhhhhhhhh glitter wrapping paper was not the best choice  it looks like ten or twelve kandie kids had an orgy on my bed 
lately i can't sleep at all 
everything hurts  sad 
i have awesome friends   love 
apparently it's another one of those non sleeping nights  can't say i approve 
brraaaaaiiimmmmmmssss
yaay! snow day tomorrow  which means i can sleep in  which means awesomesauce 
"dear winter, please stop crapping all over us  snow days were fun at first, but honestly my nerves really prefer otherwise  thanks!"
finally back to school and <propfemale> wakes up with pink eye  fml
what an effing morning 
"signed on a(rental) house today! not the weird, old lady mansion house with the excessive gold detailing, but a nice, newer, smaller one  i really like it  soooo, we shall be moving back to tx soon "
snow day did not happen  we did get a two hour delay at least!
ahhh  unintentional 7pm naps always screw me 
noooo no no no  i am not getting sick again  not gonna happen  no 
it's a good day for a snow day 
*cry*
"if you happen to see a bunch of bald people sitting naked in the snow outside of a burning house, that's us "
it's amazing to me that it's 2011 and we haven't figured out a safe and efficient way to get rid of lice from this world
