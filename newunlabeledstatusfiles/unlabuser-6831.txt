"see, breaking up it's hard to move along it's even harder\it's over she got colder now can't locate where her heart is\and i'm just being honest, since we not even talking\my mind won't let you go\she even consider stalking na\you know i be teasin' no\you know that my ego won't\thought this was forever love\guess that was just seasonal\she got back with her old boy\she's probably had a reason though"
so gettin to the point where i either gotta start growin my hair out again or buzz it again

i wanna quit   
"whenever you need me \whenever want me, \you know you can call me, i'll be there shortly \don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me \i can be your best friend, and you be my homie \i ain't gonna flex, i'm not gonna front \you know if i ball, then we all gonna stunt \send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up \whenever you call baby i roll up"
