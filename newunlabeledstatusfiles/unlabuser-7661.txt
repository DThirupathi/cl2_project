i wonder what medical school is best for someone who wants to pursue neuroscience 
"i want to volunteer in hospitals, clinics, or anything where i can help people in a medical atmosphere   ideas?"
"these are some rather obvious thoughts that just randomly popped in my head: \language is just a means through which we can communicate our perceptions   it must have been frustrating being an infant, perceiving new things constantly but being unable, for the most part, to communicate these feelings and perceptions effectively "
"what if there were schools that would take a child from elementary school through high school with an emphasis on a certain career such as a specialty in the medical profession, and after receiving that school's high school education that child would be able to enter directly into their career or go directly to a professional school (e g  med school, law school, etc) "
"there comes a time in life when you walk away from all the pointless drama and people who make it, and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus on the good  life is too short to be anything but happy  true friends should pray for each other and build one another up; not tear one ano   ther down  re-post if you agree  i just did "
"as a future physician, i want to be one of the ones who helped eliminate the threat of alzheimer's disease  for now, i'm taking baby steps by supporting the alzheimer's association  if you have the time & feel something should be done about the sixth worst killer in the u s , then please support with me  [check earlier post to take action]"
what is living in this world worth if you never give it anything worthwhile?

"change\your fb profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood  the goal is \to not see a human face on fb til monday, dec  6  join the fight against\child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your \friends to do the same"
i am ready for this break to start already!
i just lost thirteen rounds of pool to my uncle   i'm so embarrassed 
"i believe in jesus christ  one facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall  the bible says, if you deny me in front of your peers, i will deny you in front of my father  this is a simple test  if you love god and you are not afraid to show it, re-post "
"never be wishy-washy, or you'll be counted as a hypocrite  (paraphrasing <propfirst> 5:12)  nobody trusts a half-heart   be firm in your yes or your no "

"got bored with studying, put on earphones, and started singing grenade from <propmale> mars   apparently much louder than he had thought "
