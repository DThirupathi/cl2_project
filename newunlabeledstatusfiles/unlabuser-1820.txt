life is like seseame street  you can be living in a dumpster and wind up singing 
somewhere between the darkness and the light  somewhere between who i was and who you're making me  somewhere in the middle is where you'll find me  ~casting crowns
between a rock and a hard place  so why not walk beside the both? one will eventually give up or die 
thankful for lots of things!
just wanna sit down for thirty minutes then everything would be perfect 
"his arms were stretched out as far as they'd go nailed to the cross for the whole world to know i love you this much and i'm waiting on you to make up your mind, do you love me too? how ever long it takes i'm never giving up no matter what i love you this much  ~ <propfirst> <propmale>"
