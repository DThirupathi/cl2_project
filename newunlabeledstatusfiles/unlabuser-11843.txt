"knows that there comes a time when you get tired of trying to help people     it's not a sign of giving up, but a sign that you don't need them in your life!"
"i wish i had the courage to kill myself and ened this nonsensical existence    but i made a promise to the most important person to me that i would never try that again   now he won't even take the time to try to help or understand me   i feel like i'm already dead, so why won't god take mercy on me and end it? what sort of sick kick does fate get out of watching me flail around like this?"
"   i just want you to put you're arms around me, to hold me tight and tell me you still love me, want me and that's its going to be ok!"
remember that time you said you would never give up on me? because you loved me too much? what happened to that?
