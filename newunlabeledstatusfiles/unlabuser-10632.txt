"the person who has never made a mistake in their life is allowed to talk shit about me once! for all the others, and those who i do not even talk to why is it so hard for you to keep my name out of your mouth?"
"can't is a word none should speak without blushing; \to utter it should be a symbol of shame; \ambition and courage it daily is crushing; \it blights a man's purpose and shortens his aim  \despise it with all of your hatred of error; \refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain; \arm against it as a creature of terror, \and all that you dream of you some day shall gain "
had a great time tonight! thanks girls!
"yay! new car, finally "
"saw my darkest days, saving <propmale>, and hinder in concert with good friends, had a great time!!!  smile "

"it's brother's week! if you have a brother who has made you laugh, punched you, stuck up for you, drove you crazy, annoyed you to no end, hugged you, wathced you succed, saw you fail, picked you back up, cheered you on, made you stronge, and is someone you are very proud to have in your life  re-post, even though they can be an idiot"
your smirking cause you think you've won and you think you have gotten away with it and i'm smiling & laughing cause i know you haven't          
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, being a bitch, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they left off, even if it has been months ( or even years) apart  they love you   for who you are  re-post if you have at least one true friend  they will know who they are "
