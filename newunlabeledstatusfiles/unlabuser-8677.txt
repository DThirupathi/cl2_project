i'm tired   and i only got a facebook because a friend told me to   bribed me to   i don't know why i have one   i like myspace better
"what's on my mind?? the fact that i'm getting up in 5 hours and giving other people a bath and getting one from my friend  also brushing each other's teeth, feeding each other jello, and learning to measure fluid intake and output using catheters    at 7 in the morning    my life says  yay all over it!!"
is the luckiest person on earth   being in loive is finding one soul living in two bodies   and that has indeed been the case for 4 years and 3 days  smile 
sooooooo   my car has had hiccups for two or three weeks   just one after another   it's a car with tertiary infections!!! how does that happen?!?!?!?!?!
"so i was made aware that when i wear my all white scrubs, i look like i work in an asylum   and at the end of the day it sort of feels like it   creepy huh??? that's how my life is "
"loves watching these kittens grow  it's amazing to see how they all have their own personality, likes and dislikes, and how much they know out of instinct  there is no way anyone can tell me that god made animals devoid of personalities  smile  (p s  my kitten typed this emoticon randomly just by stepping on my keyboard) lol"
is stressing out!!! we all got the talk in class today about how we have to step up the pace if we want to succeed in life   no pressure at all!!!
is getting ready for clinicals tomorrow  iget my own patient tomorrow   
"is a stressed, confused, frazzled, tired, exhausted, exasperated, and will start all over again tomorrow  going to bed yall  see ya later!!"
i hate paperwork!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not only does the class have to be super hard and a ton of work but the paperwork comes out of your ears!!! i'd rather buy a car   less paperwork!!
"yeah, but it's like 4 years of pain so that you can make money in 4 years  right now its just like paying them $4,000 so that you can work work work work work and still be broke "
"has a question  how many people could take care of a teenager, two kids, a toddler, a dog, and three baby kittens for a day and still write a paper that's due tomorrow? i can!!!  smile "
just finished a 3 <propfemale> paper  smile  i'm satisfied at least 
is adding the final touches to her paperwork and her scholarly paper  then i get to print and go lawn mowing tomorrow   yay for money!!!!!!
"just made $85 in lawn mowing money  $25 goes to <propfemale> for helping me, $5 went to drinks, $20 goes to my gym membership (that i don't use), $10 for gas for school, and $25 for <propmale> for working on my lawn mower   end of the day   $0 richer  smile    anyone need a babysitter or landscaper?  laugh "

needs prayer  please please please please pray for my classes  i'm scared  it is crunch time and i am apparently not doing as much as i need to to succeed in my classes  pray that i will have peace of mind during my tests and succeed in all of my classes 
is so relieved! thank you everyone who prayed for me today  everything went smoothly and i felt so much more confident with my skills than i have felt all summer  god knows what your plans are before you do them   it's up to you to find out what god's plan is  keep praying for my classes though  i'm not out of the doghouse just yet 
"thank you to everyone who has been supportive, understanding, and helpful in my struggle with this class  i have to say from e playful erience that criticism has not been any help at all  as a matter of fact it makes me despondent  my mind shuts down and i give up   so thank you for the music people "
i am not doing well at all  my first car accident to add to all the trouble  i stink at life  i quit 
"for everyone who was wondering  i am ok  i am just being tested this summer  i firmly believe that god is trying me, testing me, and trying to improve me   i am a house under construction, sometimes you have to destroy some walls so you can put up new ones"
