"life is a journey  everything in it is a process  it has a beginning, a middle and an end  all aspects of life are always developing  life is motion  without movement, advancement and progression, there is no life  once a thing has ceased to progress, it is dead--joyce meyer"
sometimes we think we need a miracle in our situation when what we truly need is a miracle of revelation that will change our attitude and alter our approach to life--joyce meyer
