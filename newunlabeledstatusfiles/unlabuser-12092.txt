bored
life is meaningless! chaos! the universe has no center! the creator is a drooling idiot!
take what you can! give nothing back!
the beast is the beast let it run free
become the animal you are meant to be not the shell of a human that everyone e playful ects you to be 
"i'm beaten down again, i belong to them\beaten down again, i've failed you\i'm weaker now my friend, i belong to them\beaten down again, i've failed you"
for once i like to make some real money not this f@#$n loose change

need a new face
fools rush in where angels fear to tred

i'm at a lost  don't know no more  not sure of anything  wonder if there really is a good ending  but which road to take  i ponder on all this but get lost in the void and wonder if i can escape 
"i feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin\i must confess that i feel like a monster\i hate what i've become, the nightmare's just begun\i must confess that i feel like a monster"
havin me some fun tonight

"let's see how creative my facebook friends are    leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name    it can only be 1 word    then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you    don't just post a word & not copy, that's no fun   smile "
being a simple kind of man
