"1349: wow  i've known you since high school, and you were totally awesome to chat with  always a pleasure to talk with you, as even during some of the worst of times in your life, you'd always be a positive <propmale>, never a negative <propfemale>  with that type of attitude, anything is possible for you! traits like those are very impressive, and again to quote the song, \thank you for being a friend!\"""""
"3: it's seems only yesterday i met you whilst at the same time it feels like i've known you my entire life  neither is, of course true in a literal sense  i feel as there is still much we can talk about as friends, and there will be a time for that  thanks for being part of sga, and you are very fortunate for the people in your life, as they help to build on your already dynamic character!"
"-1^(1 2) : a few months ago, i hardly knew you  but as time went on, i've gotten to know you better, and you are literally a human enbodiment of someone opening a can of whoopass combined with 1337, roflmao and awesome  every day you come up with a new gem of knowledge that is both insightful and funny  and since you care about everyone, you'd be an awesome teacher if you ever considered the path!"
"23: i remember when i first met you in professor harmon's texas politics class  then you joined sga, so i had plenty of times to say hi and how are you doing (well after we finished harmon's class), and you were always a pleasant person to chat with  feel free to drop on by the office and say hi or send a message! i'd always be delighted to talk with you!"

"0689: you're literally the first person in this list i can legitimately say i hardly know (we only met less than a month ago)  you certainly are a cool person, and you're dedicated to every task you put your efforts in  hopefully we can get to know each other in the near future!"
"2612: it's been a while since we've really talked  you've always had fresh and innovative ideas, and when you were running that newspaper i always found myself amused with the writing and all  glad to see you're back at utsa and gearing towards graduation!"

"8: wow  where to begin    you've been an awesome friend, and i'm going to miss you when you graduate  it will definitely be a different place in the uc3 and at utsa without you  i think you still would have made a great senator for sga!"
"12988976: you sir, are a badass, and i'm glad you joined sga  better late than never  you'd always found a way to get things done at utsa, and i think you will excel in law school  you better come back and visit us often  finally, you are a millionaire    with a huge wealth of quality, solid, awesome friends   laugh "
