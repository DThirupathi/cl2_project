went to physical therapy today  the woman told me my spine is not in the correct position when i sit or stand     now to try to undo 14 years of holding my spine incorrectly  yay gymnastics?
"why, when someone tells you to lie still for an mri, does it become the most difficult thing in the world? everything seems to itch  and every muscle wants to twitch "
i eat all your foods
i hate doctors 
i need to get paid now
and the world spins madly on
not feeling well at all today    annoyed 
as if homework wasn't difficult enough already when i didn't feel super sick 
"seriously, what is going on  since when does my back pain hurt so bad that i literally can't walk? i'm not even doing gymnastics anymore   "
i guess the nearing of the end of the semester entails spontaneous trips to disneyland  smile 
"the 91 freewy is too valuable  when it shuts down, it takes hours to go around because all of the other freeways become chaotic   "
"woke up at 6 smile 0am due to an annoying cat, drank two cups of coffee while watching pirates of the carribean, off to work early to do some cleaning for extra money, more work until 6:15pm, family friends from up north visiting for the weekend, more friends coming over tonight to <propfemale> out, eat pizza, and swim    sounds like a busy, productive, and enjoyable day to me "
 crying 
and the winds that blow remind me of what has been and what can never be

"3d tv is much too realistic for me  and so, i am stuck watching abc family halloween movies instead of actual horror films "
i think being in a gym full of people all singing the veggie tales theme song in unison is a once in a lifetime event 
finishing my paper before the 11:59pm deadline calls for a celebration  toy story 3!!!!  smile  i've waited so long for this moment!!!
this whole figuring out my future thing is really confusing my brain
"i have a lot of energy that i want to put to good use  but not in the way i should    instead of doing homework and going to work like i need to (and will ultimately end up doing), i would rather be baking cookies, crocheting a blanket, painting my nails, or having a movie marathon with a good friend  oh the wonderful world of responsibilities   "
<propfirst> pan tonight with the family at the oc performing arts center  i'm so excited!!!!
"one presentation, one final paper, two research papers, a p e  paper, and 5 finals stand in the way of me and my winter break    praying for the motivation to get through this without tears "

glee performing the dirty dancing song and <propfemale> and the machine =  love 
"don't you just hate when you can't, for the life of you, remember someone's name?    and you end up spitting out every name you can think of    then wind up thinking a song title was the name you were looking for    just me? oh ok   "
a free show at my school by <propfirst> bazan? don't mind if i do
