today:  quite possibly hired for real!  also pie
"fuck you, pokemon "
"getting shot down after interviews is becoming aggravating   the bank account being overdrawn more so   surviving on my paypal infuriating   i would like one thing   one thing to go right, at some point within the next, i dunno   sixty years or whatever "
i like being told to come <propfemale> out just to be flatly ignored by everyone in the room   makes me feel like the 'friendships' are worth it 
beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy  y n?
"thank you, facebook, for implementing the stupidest feature i've ever seen - the last thing norps need to witness are half-naked pictures of me from a fag-tastic nerd convention when i was 21 "
"quick glance at the news today shows most of the stories cover the sotu address last night   in my late teens early twenties, i'd have chastised people for not watching it, nor allowed myself to miss it \\nowadays, though, i realize the only thing worth doing when a president makes a speech is to get drunk with your friends, eat bad chinese take-out and play video games   guess how i spent my tuesday~"
"hello, facebook   where the fuck have i been for two-and-a-half months?"
all night with minny and <propfemale> at fitzgerald's to see combichrist   fuck i loved the show   absolutely need to pass out; long work week + six hour concert = tired as shit
"'twas out with <propfemale> and braden last night; simply marvelous time   but my stupid internal clock dictated that i wake up at 7 smile 0 - seriously <propmale> over   why do you do this to me, body? wrrrrrrrrryyyyy?!!!!!\\i need an omelet    indecision "
<propmale> <propmale> is gonna have to cut a bitch 
"so it's official - granddad's got copd, still hasn't been released from the hospital   family's planning a trip up to pittsburgh to see him shortly   i always intended to go back on my own terms after i moved away and visit with him again, but i never thought it would come to this \\figures that's how shit goes down "
"supposed to be at a bar with friends, instead, in considerable pain  fml"
"man, i cannot thank anyone enough who's wished me a happy birthday today   it has honestly been a day made of such complete shit that coming home and seeing all the well-wishes was a very positive thing for me   thanks to everyone so much   love "
"i only have one vote - but i will not give that vote to any federal incumbent in 2012, not after seeing the end result of the last two months of political infighting today   neither the president nor my congressional representatives in the house and senate will benefit from me "
it's not dropping out of college the first time that broke my back; it was rolling over and allowing myself to become a sheep 
"i miss the days when playing a video game meant turning on your console and pressing the start button; not logging into a million accounts, downloading a thousand patches and system updates, and have streamed commercials rammed down your throat "
third straight day of rain   woken up by waves of it hitting the windows and thunder rumbling in the distance   so glad it came; we needed this badly   fires were licking at the city's western edge just this past week 
"found an email from paypal in my inbox congratulating me on blowing $5k this year through them; considering the only thing i use paypal for is to buy warhammer crap on ebay, i suppose i'm living proof of the fact that you really can spend $40k playing 40k   fml"
"take a trip to toys 'r us; buy yourself one of those <propfemale> foam axes   put on your best pair of cool shades, get in your car, roll down your windows, play your preferred kind of power metal and charge down the highway swinging said axe out the window while singing - badly - at the top of your lungs \\treasure the looks you get from your fellow motorists for the remainder of your life "
"i'm really curious to know what sort of fuzzy math was used to conclude only 53% of the country is paying taxes   i sure as hell remember federal and state taxes being pulled out of my paycheck when i worked minimum wage; i don't recall getting more than a slim percentage back on my return, either   i don't recollect being able to opt out of paying the sales tax for retail purchases, either, let alone getting a discount on fill-ups by excusing myself from the gas tax   unless something's drastically changed in the last 7 years (apart from this so-called 53% losing their sense of human compassion), i call bullshit "
"flattus is dead   no  fucking  way \\rip, <propfirst> - i loved you on stage "
