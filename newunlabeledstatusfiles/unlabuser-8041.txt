has nearly a hundred more screenshots to go through just for one season of the fortress he's running for his story before he's up to date with it   he also takes far too many screenshots

   speaking of the geek test   
wants you all to know that the giant headless blobby guy is not pleased 
apparently oop is too complicated for these twits in class to understand   or the professor is too much of a twit to e playful lain it using polysyllabic words   either way 
woke up to a bunch of mexicans tearing off the roof less than five minutes before class started   worst wake-up call ever 
just accidentally got on his soapbox for ten solid minutes in film class   oops

", after almost two solid hours of wrestling with power game factory, has figured out how to make an enemy capable of controlling its own vertical flight speed   the first thing that the test character did was fly straight up and off screen and hide up there where i couldn't test it any further "

"last class of the semester, nothing of any use or interest whatsoever is happening, and i can't leave!  troubled "
has just discovered that he is way too braindead today to code well   this is unfortunate   has also just realized that he only really uses fb to complain 
"just used \yay done\"" as a comment on his code and is now worried for his sanity """
"is going to have, far and above, the best new year's eve day in his life, assuming nothing goes horribly horribly wrong "
"just realized, after being in this class for over an hour, why his professor is already boring: he's an unfunny <propmale> "
"ohhhhh this does not bode well   i haven't known the guy for thirty whole seconds, and i already can't understand a word my calculus professor is saying "

"\it's only funny when your arm hair is illuminated \""    it's been an interesting day """

"you know, i remember when reviews actually had something to do with the material that needed reviewing "
"has pebbles flying up his nose and making him cough, but that's okay because he's gorgeous  also, semi-related, this  http annoyed  loadingreadyrun com videos view 212 gorgeous"
would like very much if someone would commission a collar from him soon 
"again, i repeat: commission a collar!  they're awesome! http annoyed  www facebook com notes jacob-van-de-graaff custom-collar-pricing-list 397108078712 pictures of materials and finished collars are to be forthcoming within the week, so if you're waiting on that before buying one, you shouldn't have to wait much longer "
"updated the collar pricing list again, now with pictures of all the current fabric types! http annoyed  www facebook com note php?note_id laugh 97108078712"
"<propmale>'s birthday today    kinda wishing he was around to see it   er    in the physical sense, anyway "
"depression is not a sign of weakness  it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long  put this as your status if you or someone you know have had depression  most people won't, but its mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives  show your support ~"
what the fish it's snowing   again   at the end of april   one more day of this and i will officially go mad 
snowing again   the unhappiness from this is mostly balanced by the absolutely awesome development that is my newly-reconstructed train table   pictures coming soon 
"first photos of the railroad are online, yay!"
just so we're clear on this: i hate needles!  haaaate 
just got more or less the best news ever 
steam usernames   you have them   i want them 
team rocket is rocking!
"the single best piece of advice i think i can give anyone is this: never, ever forget that one hundred percent of everything depends in some way on context "
the sky here was mad pink for about ten minutes earlier    it was amazing 
"has spent the entire week thus far in the presence of the two people he loves most in the world  it's been emotionally strenuous, but far, far beyond amazing "
is just _barely_ coping right now   
"twenty-seven more hours, then i leave for chicago   getting back on the 5th   probably will update some during the trip, but not much "
"hates moral dilemmas, especially when they hit so close to home     ugh, i don't even know if i'm doing the right things anyway "
last night    prohibitively traumatic   it's going to be a long day 
has just realized that he generally really doesn't like making promises   or promises in general   but mostly making them 
regarding my new semi-imaginary gay lover <propfemale> who also happens to be a demigod: the human mind is a very weird thing 
drama on the one hand and abuse on the other   isn't life fun?
"inspector gadget binge continues   day 2 ended, day 3 very likely to begin tomorrow morning "
"as predicted, more inspector gadget today   i should really have breakfast at some point "
"and now, somehow, i feel even more scummy   way to go, <propmale> "
"i need support, badly   i don't know what i need, but i do know it won't be found here "
