every day you hold on to your lonely broken heart (it's tearing you apart) god is calling out to you just let healing start (will you open up and let him in) you decide (who will you run to) wrong or right (there is no reason) for you to hide  only love can change your life  you decide 
"sometimes it's hard to just keep going  but faith is moving without knowing  can i  trust what i can't see to reach my <propfemale>?  i want to take control but i know better  god i want to dream again, take me where i've never been  i wanna go there, this time i'm not scared  now i am unbreakable, it's unmistakable  no one can touch me, nothing can stop me "
"i'm here again a thousand <propmale> away from you  a broken mess, just scattered pieces of who i am  i tried so hard  thought i could do this on my own  i've lost so much along the way  then i'll see your face  i know i'm finally yours  i find everything i thought i lost before  you call my name  i come to you in pieces  so you can make me whole  --red \pieces\"" """
"and it finds me  the fight inside is coursing through my veins  and it's raging  the fight inside is breaking me again  --- red \fight inside\"""""
no matter what is said to me   no matter what is done to help me  no matter what i do  i can't find my way out 
stayed the night with <propfemale> and gang and didn't sleep at all  i've learned a lot    
just try it and i know you'll be happy  you just need to take that step  please trust me     
pretty much spent the day with molly     had fun      smile 
i am so bored       
i wonder when she talks about missing him and all that stuff who she is referring to    it's probably not me      crying   or it could be for more that one person  surprise       or it could just be for me  smile         but i doubt it    sad 
"hello    \?  \ ? \  \\"
    just tired    
"cause all of the stars have faded away  just try not to worry, you'll see them someday  take what you need and be on your way and stop crying your heart out "
friday's don't seem to mean much to me anymore       
 sad  pray for me please   
 crying 
"so sure she was like a brother til you dropped another  so sure you kept it under covers until you knew you laughter (loved her?)\now you canâ€™t think straight because youâ€™re not straight in the back of her motherâ€™s car "
i'm falling apart     i can't do anything right anymore  i'm about to push a lot of people away bc i'm insecure and i deserve to be beaten     
i feel a change in me and it's taking hold and bringing me down to the lowest point i have ever been  sorry to all those i have brought light to that i'm such a disappointment  this is all my fault 
"wake up, now it's over, just tell me it's ok to die"
i can't sleep     i'm not sure what i want to do bc i don't know what you want and i'm bummed and in pain  i don't want to lose you no matter how much it hurts  if you're happy with him then i'll just deal with the pain and find a way to be friends  it won't be the same but it won't matter bc you'll be happy with him  i'm really really sad 
it's getting worse   no matter what i do    how much i pray    it's only dark  i don't blame anyone    it's my own fault and i'll suffer for it     
<propfemale> made my day       you make me so happy     
and all i can taste is this moment and all i can breathe is your life cause sooner or later it's over i just don't want to miss you tonight   and i don't want the world to see me cause i don't think that they'd understand  when everything's made to be broken i just want you to know who i am 
i'll find a way to make it through by holding onto you    
"wish i could just stop by and maybe say hi, wish i could just stop by and lay by your side      sad  i miss you t "

"if there is an exception to every rule, then every rule must have at least one exception; the exception to this one being that it has no exception  there's always an exception to the rule, except to the exception of the rule â€” which is, in of itself, an accepted exception of the rule "
religion is a lot more like politics  the only difference is that with religion you get to confess your own sins 
"gonna <propfemale> out in the freakin heat, but it's with friends so it's all good "

"you tell me that you need me then you go and cut me down, but wait  you tell me that you're sorry  didn't think i'd turn around, and say   \it's too late to apologize, it's too late "

"darling, i forgive you after all  anything is better than to be alone  and in the end i guess i had to fall  always find my place among the ashes  i can't hold on to me  wonder what's wrong with me?"
"and if i bleed, iâ€™ll bleed, knowing you donâ€™t care  and if i sleep just to dream of you and wake without you there, isnâ€™t something missing?"
 crying 
i dont think she understands the sacrifices that i made  maybe if this bitch had acted right i wouldve stayed  but ive already wasted over half of my life i wouldve laid  down and died for you i no longer cry for you  no more pain bitch you  took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  into the dirt i can no longer stand it
"forming a new, stronger crew  it is a time for friends to stand up with one another and overcome whatever comes our way "
i thought i was waiting for the girl i loved but all i was really waiting for was another heart break    right when i was about to move on she claimed that she needed me then turned around to cut me down  it's all good though     i'm not going to wait for anyone ever again

"blood-stained sheets in the shape of your heart  this is where it starts  this is where it will end  here comes the <propfemale> again  beyond the pale everything is black, no turning back  } sad "
"sever me from the fall  fuck the people, fuck the world, fuck it all  open my arms, bleed out the flood in crimson i begin to drown  distance yourself from the pain that covers me  i reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me   sad "
"home sweet home  something in the night felt like a door had been opened, an <propfemale> of the past, an old monster snapping its eyes open in the depths of my brain  closing your eyes forces you to look at the darkness inside "
the thing is    when you live in a dark world of the hopeless; faith is just a few steps out on to an active intersection when things go wrong you can assure yourself that it's okay but the pain doesn't go away  it'll infest in your brain to make sure it doesn't go away 
 crying 
"i get it    i lost, you win  don't back off of me now give me the rest of it   you never held back before why should it fucking matter now  i'll make it easier for you and disconnect from everyone else  they lied to me and hurt me anyhow "
underneath the cold anger and pain    there are still traces of warmth that still cares   maybe that's why it hurts so much for so long 
i tracked you down with this  this is my timey-wimey detector  b)
train in da way      needs to move but nope still sitting there    working on teleportation which irks me bc it's all fine and dandy when ya get all the molecules to break apart to travel to another area instantly but they won't go back together that well  on a side note     live subjects require too much cleaning after e playful eriment 
"will you still hold me when you see what i have done? will you still kiss me the same, when you taste my victim's blood?"
ya know when you watch a person try for something knowing very well that the outcome will be the same as before but they think they can change it some how by doing nothing different      just need to tell myself to step away from the retard
