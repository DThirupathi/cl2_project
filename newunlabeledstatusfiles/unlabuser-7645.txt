"\anybody can do just about anything with himself that he really wants to and makes his mind to do  we are capable of greater than we realize \""\",9c296030e826a265aea31d26f7df16cf,"love is the answer at least to most of the questions of my heart like why are we here, where do we go, and how come it's so hard    it's always better when we're together, yeah it's always better when we're together   "

5   4   3   2   1    and continue to  wait  lol the car business is very slow in october i guess 
"life moves very fast  it seems even if your life is steady there's so much going on around you  there's never an excuse to not make your life the best possible, just step out of the comfort zone and brace yourself to get swept away   smile  maybe that's a good thing"

"breathe deep the gathering gloom,watch lights fade from every room bedsitter people look back and lament,another day's useless energy spent impassioned lovers wrestle as one,lonely man cries for love and has none new mother picks up and suckles her son,senior citizens wish they were young cold hearted orb that rules the night,removes the colours from our sight red is grey and yellow white "

note to self: if <propfirst> comes back inside before going to work and warns me that it's treacherous outside don't: 1) wear heels 2) lay in bed where it's warm instead of going to start your car 3) think its going to take less then 30 minutes to get out of the driveway and finally 4) assume he's exaggerating even in the slightest
if it takes the employees 30 plus minutes to get to the store why do we think anyone else is going to bother to show up to buy anything? idk crossing my fingers
