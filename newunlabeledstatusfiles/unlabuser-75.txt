why is it when someone u know dies that the first thing most people do is drink? why would u have a fundraiser in a bar for a person who didnt go to the bar? i think its disrespectful to the deceased  why can't u set up a memorial fund at the bank and ask for donations to be made there instead of asking abunch of drunks for there beer money   
if finding happiness was meant to be this easy i should have joined mcb sooner!

ok well found out today i have cellulitis which is a localized infection i have currently in my left leg    i'm currently on 2 antibiotics for it    if that doesnt work my next step is to be hospitalized with a drip full of antibiotics    oh so much fun of having a compromised immune system 
well leg is doing alot better today no pain and it looks like it stop spreading thanks to 200 mg of doxycycline and 2000 mg of keflex everyday 
it's nice when u have a hunch and it goes off right    taking my friend <propfirst> to my psychic <propfemale> was wonderful for him    just like any psychic she didn't open doors for him but she did open windows to help him see whats ahead    its up to him to open the doors

"big question of the day annoyed if carrots are so good for the eyes, how come i see so many dead rabbits on the highway?"

ok ortho dr  is pissed now hes taking the next step and actually putting in the paperwork that i'm disabled so medicaid will see that a specialist has diagnosed me as disabled    if medicaid would just figure out i dont want to live on the system i just need it for a little while until i'm fixed then i wont need them anymore
