"~an old man once said    there comes a time in life, when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it  you surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, and focus on the good  so love the people who treat you right, pray for the ones who don't  life is too short to be anything but happy  falling down is a part of life, getting back up is living ~"

"? if your dad is a hard working man and is and always will be your hero, helped you no matter how bad you were or was just the best dad ever, if you are blessed to still have your dad or if he is an angel in heaven, paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your dad  you can replace a lot of people in life, but you only have one dad  ?"
"in life, we do things  some we wish we had never done and some we wish we could replay a million times  but they all make us who we are and in the end they shape and detail us  if we were to reverse them, we wouldn't be the person we are today  so just live, make mistakes and have wonderful memories  but never second guess who you are, where you've been and most importantly, where your going "
