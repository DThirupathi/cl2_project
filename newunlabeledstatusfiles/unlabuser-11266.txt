"i can certainly say that i'm far from a big basketball fan but i can honestly say this: lebron is a cunt  \plain and simple  \most professional athletes are  you know why? because very very few of them actually give a shit about the team or city they play for  \professional athletes cannot help but be swayed by cash  its what they all play for  miami has more money and better, higher paid players  hence the move "
"pt2>>>>>>>>>don't get me wrong  i'm not trying to justify his choice  i think it\makes him a quitter  worse than that it's a big white flag of surrender\on his legacy  he was not able to elevate himself or his team to a\championship  \\not a single one "
"pt3>>>>>>>>>>>>>it's not that he couldn't  he can't  not without alot of help  i guess\to me that swipes him off the pedestal you have all put him off  at\least in my eyes  if it doesn't have the same effect for you just go\comfort yourself with the memory of all the nba championships he brough\us "
"it's the ol' saying that rings true from dozens upon dozens of former coaches through the years: there is no 'i' in team \\it takes a team to win and <propmale> just has to do a better job of building one "
