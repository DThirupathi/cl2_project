"i'm sorry    but it's really gross to me when you see those girls that entirely wax or shave off their eyebrows and then draw them back on their face! it always turns out 1 of 2 ways - they'll end up with these <propfemale> little penciled in lines that you can barely see   or they'll have these things that, from a distance, look like massive pieces of black licorice that stretch from one side of their face to the other!!"
"have a question    when you start a blog, can you ever change the name of it later??"

facebook wars get really old

"i feel like people only see me as an agressive, criticising bully    and that's not true! i'm just a very strong willed person (and sometimes that trait gets the best of me) - i call it how i see it and i always try my best to do it in a tactful way! i don't constantly <propfemale> over people - when i compliment someone i do it out sincerity, not empty courtesy "

sat down to the piano today for first time in over a year   i have a performance coming up in 3 weeks that i got signed up for   haha  but i have to admit ~ it felt so good to play those keys and sing like that again!! ?
feel like a failure   
i'm just sayin'   
officially feel old  ! pulled into my driveway and told 3 kids to get out of my yard! wow   hahahaha ~ wasn't that long ago i was on the receiving end of a comment like that   ha
apparently i'm not worth it   
never want to spend another night in a hospital again    ever  
don't you just looovve it when you get to prove rude and selfrighteous people wrong! oh i do!! i know i probably shouldn't   but maaann do i enjoy seeing the e playful ression of stunned humility that wipes across their face!! <propfemale>    hahahaha  smile )
ugh  it still hits me really hard sometimes   i'm not sure if the pain will ever truly go away  thank heavens for mamas though   cause i really needed a shoulder to cry on this morning    love

"everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in tucson, may i offer this little tidbit: if guns kill people, then pencils misspell words, cars drive drunk, and spoons make people fat! remember: hold the person accountable for their actions, not the means they chose to utilize!!!"
pressure makes diamonds    
i am sooo grateful for the blessings in my life! i caught myself thinking today about how this or that could be better    but the truth is ~ things could always be worse  so be grateful for what you do have  life isn't about keeping up with the jones  it's about doing the best you can!  love 
"writing a letter to my dad    not quite sure how i feel about this decision yet, but for some reason, i just know that i should   "

these pregnancy headaches are killing me!! ugh   
i love the smell of rain   it always seems so calming 
"is it just me or does anyone else get a little annoyed by the term, prego??     yes, i'm pregnant, but that doesn't mean i have a can of spaghetti sauce in my stomach  ha"
