"those who knew him would say he hated the world, which was why he was perpetually temperamental  that was in fact not true, hiei didnâ€™t hate the world; it was rather nice and filled with comfy trees and window sills  no, what hiei hated were the people in the world   "
"he was in such a fool mood on this morning for many reasons, but one reason in particular: a squirrel had thought his hair a convenient source of fluff for its nest  the furry creature was now in more pieces than your average puzzle  but it had come too late, for his hair was unevenly cropped a few inches short in the back -hiei"
