maybe it's time to sit back and let things move along by themselves for a while   i have no clue what's going on and i'm not going to pretend to  guess i'll just see what happens  i'll sit back and watch regardless of what happens  maybe i'll learn what i've done wrong 
things thicken by the hour  nothing seems to be working itself out  maybe running was a better idea in the first place   ?
feels like something's changed  i feel like i'm finally starting to figure things out 
i'd have to say that my greatest fear is disappointing my parents  (the ones that raised me   ) they've done so much and sacrificed so much for me  the least i could do is make them proud  i hope that someday i can
