go 24 go!!!!!!!!!!
there is a nascar god! the 48 didn't win the race!!
"you\ try not to be superstitious, but this year october will have 5 fridays,\ 5 saturdays and 5 sundays  this happens once every 823 years  this is \money bags  copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 \days- based on chinese feng shui  the one who does not copy will be \without  good luck!!!"

almost wreckers or checkers time
wreckers or checkers time

i'm having a yard sale today until whenever  2205 brandonwood rd  <propfemale>  sc 29505
"ok, i'm not usually a harvick fan, but i'm pulling for harvick to win this championship!"
it would really be nice if someone took the 48 out of the race!!
damn!! #24 going after #31 ass! good for u #24
"wtf, 24's pit crew is taking 48's pit crew place!"
48 does not need any help to win another championship! come on harvick  take the championship
come on harvick!!
i think we all need to pray to the nascar god's to help harvick out!
"i loved harvick's little \luv\"" tap on jj!"""
at least harvick finished ahead of jj and at least we have a new points leader!!
i really hate morning drivers!!!!!!!!

my back is killing me  looking forward to seeing the surgeon fri!
you know there are some sorry ass fathers n this world & my son's father happens to be one!!
i'm such a glutton for punishment!  when will i learn my f#@*ingram lesson?
i'd like to know where the freight train that ran over my back during the night went to  it sure does suck getting old!
people need to know what the whole story is before they make comments
"i'm upset, mad, angry, & most of all i'm pissed thef#@k off!!"
was told bad news from the surgeon about my back  it's worse than i thought
at my 25 the high school reunion  having a blast  its wonderful seeing everyone!!!

i learned a very important thing this week  i found out just who is my true friend and who is not  my eyes are wide open now and it's time for a new beginning for me and boy am i looking forward to it!!!
waiting n the surgeons office
i will be so relieved when the surgeon finds out what this thing is on my spine  it hurting more and more and tonight is a painful night
thinks that true strength lies within the ability to not kill those people in your life that just piss you off

"ok, i'm about to completely flip my noodle w this traffic!!!! i've already had to slap myself n the face!"
"every christmas you always hear people saying what they want & bought  well, this is what i want: i want people who are sick with no cure, to be able to be cured  i want children with no families, to be adopted  & i want people to never have to worry about food & shelter & heat  now lets see how many people re post this who actually c      are  i have a feeling i am gonna see almost no re posts! for <propfirst>"
"you know it takes one sorry mother fu$#&* to go to a hit a woman and his girlfriend has to jump in between to the woman wouldn't get hit!! all because he thinks everyone is to drop everything they're doing to do what he wants, when he wants! the world doesn't operate that way and it damn sure doesn't work w me!!!!"
time to hit the hay  i'm having surgery at 5:15 in the morning  i really hope i wake up on time!
"enjoying this nasty, gloomy day in my bed w my 4 legged baby"
"kiss me, bite me, tie me up  but make sure you leave me with a smile on my face!  love "
"random fact: chickens can't swallow while they're upside down   here's my question, who in the hell got paid to find that out?!!"
nothing gripes my ass more than when ur trying to talk to someone & they take their sweet ass time to say anything back!
