severely ticked off that the cookies burned  sad 
excited about the wonderful get-away weekend mi amor is planning for us!
happy that we have a good friend who is willing to watch the animals while we're away! btw- we adopted an adorable kitten and named him apollo!
well unsurprisingly someone at the university decided it was a good idea to scratch off the paint on my car's rear bumper (all the way across) and not take responsibility for it  i hate humans  99% of them should all disappear and leave the world's resources to those  who deserve them 
well being uber-sick is definitely not fun    especially right when school is just starting
feeling better but not happy with the past three hours in lab staring at fish

i am an intj and i am rare  smile 
ok so i loved my costume and so did <propfemale> (as seen in her photo album) but most people didn't get what i was going for    i thought steampunk was becoming popular    or is my costume just lacking in gadgets and clockwork?
"san fransisco, what are you thinking? those kids shouldn't be \punished\"" because their parents take them to eat fattening fast food  big brother is coming! haha"""

i took apollo to the vet today to have his manhood removed    little jerk better behave now! haha j k
"so i found out that our cat, apollo, is not a he    but an it    the vet believes that apollo has a penis and ovaries but without surgery or image scans there is no way to be sure  good news= i didn't have to pay to get apollo fixed!"
"a day of hell= apollo got a urinary tract infection, then a 12 hour drive that was supposed to be 7 hrs, but my car decided to lose a lug and lug nut and the auto parts stores don't <propfemale> the right sizes, and when we finally got back on the road, apollo got sick twice and took a couple of dumps in his carrier!"
"just in case anyone is looking for a dog, i am trying to find a new home for t'pol but she needs someone who is home a large majority of the time and can give her space to run around in "
"quick question, how does changing ones profile picture to an animated character \fight child abuse\""?"""

loving windows 7  smile 
<propmale> o'reilly is quite possibly one of the most unintelligent beings in the history of the earth 
"why is it that people assume the world is becoming a more horrible place? i think we are just e playful osed to people's atrocities more easily via media than ever before in history  and the fact that dramatic events garner people's attention more than stories of good deeds  perhaps if you stop watchin the news simply because someone got shot, then they might show more stories featuring children that raise money for cancer "
happy to have celebrated one year of being engaged to the best man on the planet!!!  smile 
sick    ugh
"\life is a journey that's measured not in  <propmale> or years but in e playful eriences\""\",b85cfb3500e85ff3a61a42a06c633767,rolled three times and played barefoot but had fun playing kickball today
"i am sad because i just realized that because my favorite animal has been dead 65 million years, i will never meet one    time to learn to be dr  <propfirst> wu "
