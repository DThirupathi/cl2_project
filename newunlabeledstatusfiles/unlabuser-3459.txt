there r just some question that can't be answered by other human being no matter how much they think they know sick of those who think they know everything
let their light be my guide i will stay true to my path and myself 
hmmm i guess this is how it's going to be but i should have known better i seems sometimes never change my own fault for thinking otherwise ac of coon squad out  playful 
nothing is absolute not even death  can't remember where i heard that but it's true 
it seems love is losing it's original meaning now someone tell me i'm wrong with a straight face  new note on the way
as the # my friends increase phase 1 of my plan is closer to complete only a matter of time before my ambition is realized!!!
phase 1 is almost complete just small things to tie up  no stupid comments please
only a few more thing and it will be the end of phase 1 on to phase 2 big plans a celaberation will take place and all of my friends and famliy will attend hopefully  this is going to be big may need help with e playful enses anyone want to help??
this is wat the fuck i'm talkin bout when i say i just can't have a good day something always ruins it y me why the fuck is my life some kind of bad joke
i'm beginning to know wat true despair is  the pain is the worst feeling ever i need someone to cheer me up  anyone want to <propfemale> out to stop this feeling 
it seem i have to push my plan phase one complete now on to phase 2 my ambition shall be realized before the summers end my plan must be in the final phase or it will all be for nothing r i p  <propmale> edwards miss u granddad  frowny 
reading hitman reborn funny as hell and good action manga
am i fool for believing in other for believing in love some do but i don't i will not falter no one will stop me from being me i'd like to see someone try!!
my life just got worst my family on my mom's side is about end up killing each other but i am not going 2 let that happen wish things could go back before this
my heart is spilt in 4 held by 4 very different people intrested to see the end of this delima  ac of coon squad aka korikage out
aw isn't that cute they think their in love well more funny than cute 2 me but people r fools it's sad 2 think love is only a fools dream it really is sad

come join me in creating a new world lets work together in making the world a better place to live!
by now we all should know better unfortunlly as human being we make the same mistake over and over again not because we're stupid it's because many of us r stubborn as well as persitint  others maybe other thing or ur just stupid maybe 
the only way to relivse my ambition is to make very hard desisions the outcome will be very intresting 
finally my plan is almost complete just a few more things left to do  ac of coon squad aka korikage out
come to think of it one of the thinks keeping me going is my love for all my family and friends but only 4 people can truly hurt me they are the 4 girl that hold a piece of my heart  ac of coon squad aka korikage k out
just got back from dayton for my granddad's funeral i'm tired no one to <propfemale> wit so i'm going to sleep
people are foolish and ignore the truth even when it staring them in the face wat a shame 
if i see another status with the words my babe in it i'm going to throw up it pointless to lie to urself if u can't stand them leave them before ur stuck with them or they will break ur heart and u either way u'll suffer love them or leave make it easier on urself  ac aka korikage out
it's sad when you caim friends as family rather then your real family  i'm feeling like that right now sometime i feel that my own family are to much  i could name 5 family members that i'm ashamed of on both my mom's and dad's side and the list continues to grow  on the other hand friends can be just as bad  well whatever still love them all  ac of coon squad of 2010 aka kroikage out!!
"i keep thinking to myself what do i want but it seems i can't think clearly anymore  i feel like i don't know who i am anymore looking in the mirror, i see a person who has lost himself in a world consumed by hate, greed, lust, and war  i'm going to do something it maybe a big mistake but a question still remains  who the hell am i?"
i'm about to break passed my limits can't take much more of this 4 once i'm going to do wat makes me happy 
in a perfect world u can do wat u want when u want but in reality there r consequence 4 every action one post on the internet or casual encounter can ruin ur life now of days the walls do have eyes
a dark shadow looms over my shoulder and it's eating away at my soul if only i could find a light shine by my side but where can i find it  ac of coon out
"swing, swing, swing \from the tangles of\my heart is crushed \by a former love\can you help me find a way\to <propfemale> on again?\-swing swing by the all american rejects"
i need to find someone who can draw some anime charaters for me is there anyone who can help me 
there is only one thing i hate more than anything i hate when people conpare me to someone else don't know why but i fuckin hate that it just pisses me off  ac aka korikage out
nothing is true and everything is premitted  i wonder what that means 
"i have never in my life been this confused, upset, or irritated i'm so fuckin tired all the arguing and bull i need a break from this madness or people need to get along  i need to find a punching bag quick or i'm going to take it out some dudes face i need something to hit!! i'm going to go <propfemale> out wit someone today  this stuff is insane  ac aka korikage out!"
"there is so much i can say about this world we live in that is messed up, and i try not to think so much about fantasy but it's my escape from this hell  in my fantasy i'm not alone in a empty space in mine i'm surrounded by all my loved ones smiling together in a peaceful bliss  with that i say this to all my family and friends i love you all and no one can change that "
i find it funny when ppl don't know i'm using sarcasm but then again maybe i'm more cruel then i give myself credit 
sometimes i think i'm the biggest idoit in the world then again maybe i don't give myself enough credit i believe i'm very intelligent may not have the best spelling in the world but i am very smart no matter what  ac aka korikage out
"people argue religion all the time when there is are some holes and information they don't have to proprely back up their argument  think about this \god\"" puts u throught trials to see if u can still have fate in him but y if he is this all knowing being he should know wheather or not u will or will not turn ur back on him e playful lain that for me i may have left sometime out """

love is sometimes miss place this is done all the time and very common in young couples ha ha how sad they really think they are in love well i guess we won't know for sure until a certian something happens
"sometimes i feel like i'm in nightmare and i can't wake up but then again the only thing that scares me is that i may never forfill my dream and i lose everyone i care about, but u know wat i will not allow that to happen i am the one who shall change the world and everyone that wants to help me make my dream a reality will see a better future for all around the world  ac aka korikage out"
"so it's not about fame and fortune,\it's about believing and believeing in yourself,\and understanding that this life is, it's life,\it's <propfemale>, and the pursuit of happiness,\and happiness is not about getting what you want all the timek,\it's about loving what you have,\so get ready it's a new day \\i've been on my grind\i can only grind\for so long   -asher roth g r i n d"
you know sometimes i know my life may not seem all that bad to others but its not a competition of who life is worst as a friend you should just understand how i'm feeling and right now my heart feels heavy and it hurt to think i get so close just to get pushed so far away i don't know how much longer i can stand it why do i care anymore   ac aka korikage out
to be forgotten and discard is the worst feeling ever but i guess i shouldn't complain so much it only makes things worst and makes me seem weak 
can someone tell me y i should give a damn about anything else but myself ive reached that point where im done <propfemale> bout anybody im sick of this bye im gone
there i go again i shouldn't let my emotions get the best of me i know i'm better than that 
i think i'm done talking about my feeling and problem to anybody i really think it's time i just keep it to myself  ac aka korikage out
i regret so much right now
i finally know y i've done everything i've done because i wanted wat everyone else had the good and i thought i could handle the bad but now i know wat i thought i wanted wat i needed i don't really need i'm just gonna let it all go  ac aka korikage out
