"i might go to gamestop this week to get a ds game for the 8-hour car ride from <propfemale> to massachusetts (and for the ride back as well)  i'm going to use my edge card, so it'll have to be a used game  i'm thinking something like fire emblem or professor layton would be good since they're easily playable in a moving vehicle  any other suggestions?"
"super <propfirst> galaxy 2  super <propfirst> galaxy 2  super <propfirst> galaxy 2  (it arrived in the mail today  if you don't have it already, order it from amazon; you will get a $20 credit towards your next video game purchase )"
