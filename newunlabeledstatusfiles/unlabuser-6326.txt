"choose, we never told him to take a side  we were there for him but he never saw it and chose the one who would hurt him more than anyone else over us, who were always there  the matter is not about ten dollars  it is because he left us  it was a choice he made-to leave, to not listen, to ignore, to take the pain "

"as we walk among these shadows, in these streets, this field of battle \take it up, we wear the medal, raise your hands with burning candles \hear us whisper in the dark, hear in the rain you see the spark \   \walk alone against all we've ever known \all we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home \but you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts \made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart"
<propfemale> hates it when people i don't know try to add me as their friend on facebook 
kayak across the pacific ocean   and it's serious??
"here we are, three years later,\still stuck beneath your hand,\as you ruin my happily ever after \people like you should be confined,\locked away behind the iron bars,\never have seen that the sun had shined \i will never be the same,\only forever changed,\past and future overflown with shame \my strongest hate\exists entirely for you,\knowing you're lying in wait \what are you waiting for?"
"another day in this carnival of souls\another night's sands end as quickly as it goes\the memories are shadows, ink on the page\and i can't seem to find my way home\all the places i've been and things i've seen\a million stories that made up a million shattered dreams\the faces of people i'll never see again\and i can't seem to find my way home\   your heaven's trying everything to break me down\ love ffdp-far from home"
"we live in a cold dark world with venom in its fangs you can spit it in my face but i know ill be ok a ball and chain,chew my arm off to get away dont fight,or it deny it,invite it cuz when it feels like a kick in the teeth i can take it ur settin me free with one more kick in the teeth im bleedin out the mouth i hope u know im stronger now im takin the hate,wont go down til im 6 feet underground"
life is great for those of us who take it in stride

"throughout my life i had all i believed i wanted and u came along and murdered me  you shattered my childhood, robbed my innocence, and tore my last threads of hope i held onto so dearly  people say to hold onto what i've got, but when it happens again and again, you know it is useless to try  this is where a person chooses to let go or stay strong  i've made my own different decision "

"if i gave you the truth,would it keep you alive?though i'm closer to wrong,i'm no further from right and now i'm convinced on the inside that something's wrong with me no there's nothing you say that can salvage the lie i'm trying to keep my intentions disguised and now i'm deprived of my conscience and something's got to give the deception you show is your own parasite just a word of advice you can heed if you like "
