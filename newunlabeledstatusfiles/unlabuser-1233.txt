i am so clever that sometimes i don't understand a single word of what i am saying 
"the future lies before you, like paths of pure white snow  be careful how you tread it, for every step will show"
they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night 
"somebody should tell us, right at the start of our lives, that we are dying  then we might live life to the limit, every minute of every day  do it! i say  whatever you want to do, do it now! there are only so many tomorrows  pope <propfirst> <propfemale>"
