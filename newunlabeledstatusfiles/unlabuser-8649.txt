"failed plans, looks like tinker's might have to wait "

"she can dance a cajun rythym, jump like a willys in four wheel drive  she's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter, she can make happy, any man alive "
"finally finished with hw and schedules, finally can sleep "
came to the realiztion that you are not a man until you accept that you are a child 
"can you give me sanctuary, i must find a place to hide, a place fo me to hide  can you find me soft asylum, i can't make it anymore, the man is at the door "
"my brain is flaming, i don't know which way to go "
a fine day indeed 
"some come to laugh the past away, some come to make it just one more day  which ever way your pleasure tends, if you plant ice, your gonna harvest wind  roll away the dew      "
"we live in the same world, the beauty is we all see it in a different way "
death makes angels of us all and gives us wings as smooth as ravens claws
