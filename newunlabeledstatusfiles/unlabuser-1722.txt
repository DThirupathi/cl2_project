"you know what's the most terrifying thing about admitting that you're in love? you're just naked  you put yourself in harm's way and you lay down all your defenses  no clothes, no weapons  nowhere to hide, completely vulnerable  the only thing that makes it tolerable is to believe the other person loves you back and you can trust him not to hurt you    unknown "

"is very tired, but glad to be going to the bar tonight   smile "
do i want to head to the icehouse before i go to the sweet home?
"fear? what is there to fear in love? love is the very reason we live  to fear love is to lose all sense of living, and if we cannot love, then why have we been put here? fearing love is like being afraid of breathing  it's not something to be scared of  it's so natural that no one can resist    unknown "

"court went well  we get arynna back tomorrow, after dhs talks to <propfirst>   smile "

"thinks low blood sugars are great, 'cause they let me eat ice cream before breakfast    smile "
would be quite happy to curl into a ball and sleep   unfortunately i have a school conference to deal with first   
"wishes the powers that be at my work would give us a little more warning before doing something that breaks all of the tools i need to do my job   really, warning on the day you're doing it, on a friday, does not help us grave monkeys make money for the company   smile "

*stomps feet* don't wanna go to work!

"love and electricity are one in the same, my dear    if you do not feel the jolt in your soul every time a kiss is shared, a whisper is spoken, a touch is felt, then you're not really in love at all    c  j  franks "
"my heart aches, today  i miss her   "
"icehouse had a band   so we went to legends  it was busy, but entertaining  home now, and getting sleepy   "

"love is   running into his arms, colliding with his heart, and e playful loding into his soul    unknown "
"do you want me to tell you something really subversive? love is everything it's cracked up to be  that's why people are so cynical   about it   it really is worth fighting for,   being brave for, risking everything for  and the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more    erica <propfemale> "

"tonight's chore: cooking, baking and preserving  i'm making applesauce and hopefully some apple butter if i have enough apples  i will be making bread pudding and butterscotch chip cookies if i have time energy  i'm also going to be freezing eggs for later use, we have a lot of 'em  feeling domestic tonight   just wish someone was here to <propfemale> out with me while i do all of this "
*flop* bread pudding and applesauce made  i tired now 
will the universe just stop messing with my head already?
"well, crap  i'm out of game time on wow  this completely blows "
still missing her  i think i always will 
was a pretty good night  i'm damned thankful for my friends  you guys are awesome 
"the stereo in tramp lives! thanks, <propfirst>  you rock   smile "
"<propfirst> and i made 13 containers of jam today   blueberry and strawberry  now, if the blueberry would just set properly  debating making cookies as well, since <propfirst> is at work and i'm utterly bored   "
"home from work on time, gonna take some allergy meds and curl up in a warm bed  once i drag <propfirst> away from wow   smile "
is sick and wanting to go home  two and a half hours left   why can't the night be over already?
i am hand-sewing a cloak  i must be insane 
"far too much to do, and no time to do it  have to figure out how to get three pans of fudge done   and i have to leave for work in an hour  this is -not- going to work  nothing is packed for revel, i still have to figure out how to feed us for the weekend, and my mother is annoying the hell out of me  gah!"
"i might have to replace my phone, if it keeps randomly rebooting on me like this  this effing sucks "
"*sighs* rhi's being a snot, while i'm trying to get things together for the event  (<propfirst> got tomorrow off   yay!) e playful lain to me why i'm taking her to the event, instead of dropping her off with her grandmother for the weekend?"
"almost done packing the truck, then on our way to blackthorne revel!  smile "
that's it   i'm shaving their heads  *is frustrated*
"things are, at the moment, looking up  here's hoping i haven't jinxed it by saying something   playful "
i have dash lights!  smile 
i fixed the wii    smile 
"temporary fix on tramp's window completed  now, on to the next project   "
"it's saturday night, and i'm stuck at home bored  gah!"
"*sighs* the world sucks, today "
"was going to go to a party tonight, but i'm sick and exhausted and just want to curl up in a miserable little ball  maybe tomorrow will be better?"
one more day of monsters   then it's back to school they go!  smile 
"damn, that's some serious rain! hello, fall?"
i am so done  i am -not- going to deal with people taking advantage of my family anymore   those who think they can are going to get a -very- rude awakening 
so tired   thank the gods tomorrow is friday  i'm so beyond done with this week now 
mmm  caramel corn   smile 
ugh   can't get sleepy -now-   i have to leave for work in two and a half hours!
is not amused   just got a disconnect notice from the water company  a <propmale> that the landlord is supposed to pay 
bored bored bored   waiting for <propfirst> to get home from work so we can go to the bar   
"*sighs* the girls are asleep, the house is -almost- silent   except that i can hear water dripping into the bucket underneath the hole in my ceiling  you know, i'm really starting to dislike this place "
is rather cranky today 
found two houses on the rmls website that i am very interested in  i wonder what my chances would be of being able to pull it off   
"i wake up to   a hell of a lot of pain, ominous text messages and a wonky voice  can i fast-forward to tomorrow, now? maybe friday?"
"has a sick mate and the makings of a large pot of chicken soup  methinks these go together, somehow "
soup made  i collapse in my chair and eat some now   smile 
"farmville was annoying me, so it's gone now "
"it has been an interesting week so far  i've dealt with the girls' school about rhi's health stuff again, played a decent amount of wow, had a couple of fantastic curries and really, haven't gotten a whole hell of a lot done  i'm happy, though "
my best friend apparently just got the double transplant he was on the list for  i'm really happy for him! *bounces*
"you know, i really like my job, but some nights it's incredibly boring  like now "
"last night seriously sucked  if i never have another night like that, it'll be too soon  sadly, those nights happen semi-frequently  still   it's the weekend! yay!"
*blinks* why exactly would a package that is leaving detroit and coming -here- go through a processing center in atlanta five days after it was mailed?
"package is here, and i'm now running bc  i can play with pretty shiny jewels!"
my main worry just disappeared  i'm almost giddy  life is good at the moment   
"so today is apparently \i am beautiful\"" day  it is also <propmale>'s birthday  anyone else seeing a connection here? *grins*"""
"is incredibly bored, thinking of maybe running around on wow for awhile  if anyone is interested in joining me, i'm on <propfemale> dream "
is the weekend really over already? i'm so not looking forward to this week   
wants everything to fall into place   -right now-!
"two more nights  gods, this week is dragging!"
"yummyween was a blast  at fat daves now, spending time with my baby away from home and the game  life is good   smile "
finally got to level 50 on my shaman  only 10 more levels to go until i reach my next goal: flight 
"i swear, life has been one long, stretched out fog of exhaustion lately  i really hope it ends soon, kinda sick of it now "
the roof   is still leaking  *sighs*
is going to be utterly exhausted at work tonight   
there is a kitten outside my apartment   all tabby striped and cute with these gorgeous <propfemale> eyes   
"happy samhain, everyone!  smile "
i fly!
"so   the transmission gave out on christine   and of course we have no resources available to fix it  we -need- her running   and right now she's sitting in the parking lot at <propfirst>'s work  sans the rear license plate, because some asshat decided to steal it \\i am -not- amused "
"if\ you have a wonderful man in your life, who may not be perfect, but is \perfect for you, who works hard (and plays harder), who would do \anything for you (in his own way of course), who makes you laugh, who is\ your best friend (sometimes you're each others only friend), who you \want to grow old with (if you don't kill him first), and who you are \thankful for every day, post this as your status "
"we pushed <propfemale> home with the tramp  i'm not sure which vehicle i felt more sorry for   <propfemale> was surrounded with smoke by the end of it, but well, tramp had to push her through a left-turn intersection   "
is tired   and so glad it's the weekend!
"the brakes on tramp died  it's at the shop, hopefully not costing a huge amount to fix   and i rented a car for the day  it's a ford focus   drives nice, but it's a ford  *sighs* still, it makes me want to drive it, but i need sleep  gah! i nap, until they call me about the truck "
"okay, so the brakes are going to cost a huge amount to fix  at the moment they're trying to get a set of pads on the rear, that's pretty much all i can afford  and really, i shouldn't even be doing that, except that i need to get to and from work \\why does everything have to go wrong at once?"
"car go zoom  unfortunately, car goes zooming back to the rental place in an hour   sad "
"got the truck back, not grinding anymore for now but i'm seriously thinking that it's more of a liability than an asset  i have a few ideas, but they're gonna have to wait a bit  rent first, then bills, then everything else  thank the gods rent gets paid today "
"so much to do, so little time   a little over a month  meep!"
wishes she were at con 
"is tired, miserable and cranky  i don't want to deal with work tonight   maybe in a few days when the antibiotics kick in and i'm not in so much pain  damned teeth "
apparently <propfemale> has gotten to the stage where she has decided to hide what she's doing on the computer from me  ideas on how to make this stop?
"$140 in phone charges on <propfemale>'s cell since august  she no longer has a phone  if anyone needs to get ahold of her, use rhi's phone, but understand that it is rhi's phone, not hers \\as for web, she's off it until further notice  i'm probably going to find a parental control program  if she earns web back  that might take awhile "
*screams in frustration*
"okay, rhi's phone goes on the 22nd  she opted to turn hers off as well in exchange for there being a house phone  unlimited local and long distance, apparently, so yes <propmale>, the girls can still call you   smile  poke at me if you want the number, people   smile "
"is tired already, and i have to leave for work in half an hour  joy  *sighs*"
tired   *whimper*
still tired   but i'm getting rid of the irritant that is my truck  this is good thing  here's hoping it all goes through okay 
"slept all day  staying home tonight, 'cause <propfirst> is sleepy  is good though, we actually get to spend some time together   smile "
"needed: 80gb hard drive (or something around there) that someone is willing to sell me cheap  <propfemale>'s computer is pretty much out of space, and i'm trying to install a game for her   "
"feeling accomplished  <propfemale> now has a larger hard drive, and i installed it in about 20 minutes   i needed a newer cable  thankfully <propfirst> was able to dig one up from his random boxes of stuff   smile "
"okay, time to drag my butt to work  *sighs* this will be an interesting night  i'm tired, not feeling well and haven't eaten a whole hell of a lot today  at least i did -one- thing right  <propfemale>'s computer hasn't crashed once so far "
sending out christmas cards  message me your address if you want one   smile 
"spent the night curled up with <propfirst> watching movies  the sorcerer's apprentice and the new <propfirst> hood flick, to be exact  i have to say that i'm extremely impressed with both  also, we got some cleaning done   still -tons- more to do on that before the 18th, but we'll get there  really, we will "
"you know, i'm starting to find the fact that so many things seem to be planned for december 18th amusing  <propfirst> and i are getting married that day at 4pm  it's going to be a small thing in our apartment, so unfortunately we can't have a whole lot of people attend   we're talking about doing a reception sometime after the first of the year  also, we'll be at pirate karaoke that night, so come celebrate with us!  smile "
ugh  i hate being sick 
not sure i like the new profile format   
early christmas gifts for <propfirst> and i - cataclysm  *happy dance*
"this sounds interesting and fun so   \\send me a fb mail message with a number and i\ll post a status with your number saying what i think of you \",234e6a4145366e4caaa06 laugh 83b5657ed,"#513: i miss you a hell of a lot  we need to <propfemale> out soon  that said, you are one of the best people i know  you are a great friend, and have a huge heart  you always tell me what i -need- to hear, wether or not i -want- to hear it "
   earrings   *twitch*
"if i'm not allowed to sleep, i should play wow, right? *snort* nope  server is full, i'm in the queue  at least it's going quickly  ish "
"i am, out of sheer boredom, installing wow on the netbook  we'll see how it runs \\now, if only i had a spare usb mouse   the trackpad on that blows "
i really want strawberry shortcake  hell of a craving to have at 5 smile 0 in the morning   *sighs*
"today seems like a good day to curl back up in bed and let the universe go to hell in a handbasket  after enough crap to deal with, you just stop caring beyond the \again? *sigh* alright   \"""""
"house is, for the most part, clean  we're as ready as we can get until the last minute madness in the morning   and tonight, we'll be at the sweet home  gonna leave to get <propfirst> and <propfirst> in half an hour   smile "
apple pie + fireball = best drink ever!  smile 
"leftover taco pizza  yum  now to get my hair done, the rest of the house done, and run around like a headless chicken \\meep!"
"i am hiding today  feel free to text, i may answer   but i'm not answering the phone "
"happy yule, everyone!"
"i give up  it's not that i can't please everyone, it's that i can't please -anyone- "
"finally home   seems like the past two days has been this huge rush of spending holidays with family  three separate houses, this year  we actually did get the tree up at our place, though, and it looks fantastic! i've got lots of pics to share   once they're downloaded from the camera that is \\best gifts received: a gorgeous chess set, a wolf candle holder and a 18 pc  knife set w block "
"my best friend is in town, and the butthead doesn't tell me until i'm getting ready for work  *sighs* here's hoping i'll get to meet up with him before he goes back to klamath falls on thursday   "
finally got the post office to deliver the package from <propmale>  the girls love their presents 
i'm wearing my slippers to work tonight  i don't know whether to be amused at this or pissed that my feet are too swollen to fit into my shoes  - -
"i'm being forced to write a moody, slightly depressed, completely obsessive character  this is going to be interesting "
"i have to say, so far <propfirst> is an amazing writing partner  even if he does go on random tangents that last for long periods of time   smile "
"the finest for of worship anyone can give is song  it doesn't matter what song, or what who you worship  music moves the soul "
"hanging out with <propfirst>, the kids, and my brother   getting stuff done around the house   it's a good day   smile "
"note to self 1: no stealing <propfirst>'s lemon-ginger tea  you will end up with his fuzzy head, sore throat and cough "
note to self 2: never start writing as you're getting ready for work 
"note to self 3: stop speeding, moron! (no, i did not get pulled over this time )"
i went to bed at about 6 smile 0am on the 10th  this is the first time i've been out of bed since then   and it's only because the only thing i've eaten is a cup of yogurt that <propfirst> brought me sometime this morning  my temp keeps going up   and i promised my boss i'd be at work tonight  shoot me?

"legend of the guardians was a cute kids flick, and it was really pretty   but i was incredibly bored the entire time i was watching it  *sighs* now, off to ice cream at <propmale> & <propfirst>'s and then to wunderland for <propfemale>'s birthday thing that we put off until today  should be relatively entertaining "
