"at the end of the day, all i'm left with is the problem of how to fill all the empty space "

why are there so many songs about rainbows and who gives a fuck anyway? rainbows are stupid they only remind me that my life is sick with decay
"you've got a fucking catheter in your brain, pissing your common sense away"
my finger hurts
in the eye of the tornado  blow me away 
have i ever told you that you should fuck off?

you are not special  you are not a beautiful or unique snowflake  you're the same decaying organic matter as everything else 
your a towel!
i feel like breaking things 
oh my god! its a leprechaun
someone's in my fruit cellar! someone with a fresh soooul!
life causes cancer
"brains!,brains for lunch, brains for breakfast, brains for brunch brains at every single meal why cant we have some guts!"
what am i to do with all this silence?
we are the angels mutants
"drinking black coffee, staring at the wall"
sepultura!!!
"no hell below us, above us only sky"
just ate 5 cookies  yum  feelin floaty
"why are there so many songs about rainbows and who gives a fuck anyway? rainbows are stupid, they only remind me that my life is sick with decay "
"twenty eyes in my head, they're all the same"
thrash 
watching amon amarth music videos just for the synchronised windmilling

a severed foot is the ultumate stocking stuffer
