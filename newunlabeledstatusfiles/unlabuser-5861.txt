why can't the past just stay in the past and leave me the hell alone!!
happy thanksgiving everyone hope you all had a wonderful day 
"greatest man in history, named jesus, had no servants, yet they called him master  had no degree, yet they called him teacher  had no medicines, yet they called him healer  he had no army, yet kings feared him  he won no military battles, yet he conquered the world  he committed no crime, yet they crucified him      he was buried in a tomb, yet he lives today  re-post if you believe with your heart"
