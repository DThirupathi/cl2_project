"watching <propmale> sleep  then i hear him start to stretch and i just know a \wahhhh!\"" is going to come soon  i think it's feeding time soon  love """
"*yawn* wish the baby would go back to sleep, i could still use a few more hours "
"<propmale> had his first visit to mommaw and poppaw raines's  it was a good visit, but he seemed to be a bit cranky and cried  he calmed down when he got in his swing at least   smile "
"<propmale> smiled at me twice this morning   love   it took some time to get him to do it, but he let them slip eventually   smile   i can't wait until he does it on a regular basis "
woo hoo! mom is coming over to help with the baby in the morning so i can actually clean house  thank god for mom's  love 
"thinks <propmale>'s hair is turning brownish red, instead of strawberry blond  maybe he will have hair like his mom   smile "
"had a great day  went to church and then visited <propmale> and <propfemale>   smile  <propmale> was so nice for most of the day, just cranky when he was hungry, but what baby doesn't do that lol"
"this week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried \but never met, or those we have held but could not take home or the ones\ that came home but didn't stay  make this your profile status if you or\ someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby        in memory of \all lost angels "
"wishes strangers would leave me alone when i go out, i know i have a cute baby  but if i don't know you   please don't touch!! maybe i'm just being an over protective momma, but i don't feel comfortable with strangers touching my baby  sad "
"hot cocoa, relaxing music, baby asleep   bliss  love "
i got a mom haircut today  lol no more little fingers getting tangled in my curls  i sure do feel light headed now  smile 
"going to try and ween <propmale> of his pacifier  i had hoped this time wouldn't come until he was 2 or 3, but he's waking up almost every hour or so in the night to want it put back in his mouth  i can't take many more of those nights   sad "
"<propmale> took his nap with only a few minutes of crying for his pacifier this time, last nap was 15 minutes  i hate doing 'cry it out', it makes me feel so bad know all i'd have to do to make him happy is giving him his paci, but if i gave in, there'd never be any sleep  sad "
wonder how many trick-or-treaters i'll get this year? last year i had a grand total of one! lol happy halloween everyone 
i think <propmale> is becoming a 'momma's boy'  we went to my parents today and the only people he would let hold him were mommy and me  he cried when daddy or my grandparents tried to hold him   sad  i guess it's because he doesn't get to see them as often 
"<propfirst> took care of <propmale> for most of the day today  he gave me a three hour nap and then i had to leave for an eye exam and went shopping  when i got home he told me he didn't know how i did it, it really took a lot out of him today  lol!"
had a great thanksgiving yesterday  i got to see my cousins that i don't get to see but a few times a year  now i'm clearing out a space in the living room so i can put up the tree tomorrow  <propmale> is only 4 months old and has already taken over the living room  i hope i can maneuver all his things around to fit the tree in  smile 
"<propmale> has finally learned to roll from his tummy to his back! <propfirst> got to see his first time this morning, and i just saw him do it again   smile  he's been in the floor looking at his feet and rolling from side to side, and sometimes rolls on over to his belly "
"jacob---my\ son is the only one who knows how much i love him   because he is the \only one who knows how my heart feels on the inside  {{post this to your\ status if you have a child that you could never live without}} mommy \loves you so much i couldn't ever imagine my life without you    you \will always be mommy's baby boy   "

"<propmale> is growing so fast  i noticed his shirt was very hard to get off of him, it's size 3-6 months, i tried a 6-9 months on him and it fits perfectly!  love "
"god saw you getting tired & a cure was not to be  so he put his arms around you & whispered come with me  with tearful eyes, we watched & saw you pass away  although we love you dearly, we could not make you stay  a <propfemale> heart stopped beating, hard working hands at rest  god broke our hearts to prove to us, he only takes the best  put this on your status if there is someone in heaven you will miss this christmas"
"greatest man in history, named jesus, had no servants, yet they called him master  had no degree, yet they called him teacher  had no medicines, yet they called him healer  he had no army, yet kings feared him  he won no military battles, yet he conquered the world  he committed no crime, yet they crucified him  he was buried in a tomb, yet he lives today  re-post if you believe with all your heart  <propfemale> christmas  "
"had a wonderful christmas  <propmale> is loving his gifts, especially his new exersaucer  when i put him in it last night he went straight to playing and jumping in it  he giggled so much, it was so sweet   love "
<propmale> loves music so much  every time people are singing on t v  he automatically looks up towards it  it even makes him stop in his tracks when he's in his exersaucer  lol
"<propmale> is teething   low grade fever and very fussy  i'm excited for his tooth, but the process is horrible!"
"i just read an article that disney is no longer making <propfemale> movies after tangled  they say after 5 or 6 girls are no longer interested in <propfemale>, instead want to be 'cool' or 'hot'  that is not something they should promote! bring back the <propfemale>'s!"
"your son will hold your hand for only a little while, but will hold your heart for a lifetime  its sons week    if you have a son who makes your life worth living by just being around them, and if you're proud of your son, copy and paste this to your status "

"you would think that when the dog barks, <propmale> wouldn't like it  instead, he thinks it's funny  lol how strange "
"this week we remember all babies born sleeping, or whom we have carried but never met, or those we have held but could not take home, or the ones that came home but didn't stay  make this your profile status, if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby  the majority won't do it, because unlike cancer, baby loss is still a taboo subject  break the silence  in memory of all lost angels ?"
"i know it will be a while before <propmale> can crawl, but he wants to  his toy pooh bear is out of his reach, and his little arms and legs make the motions   smile "
<propmale> is scooting a little across the rug! it won't be long now until he figures out how to crawl  love

my poor doggie  i believe our dog will be <propmale>'s incentive to crawl  i can put his toys in front of him and he doesn't seem to care  the dog sits near him and he starts to laugh and reach for him  only problem is  our dog is afraid of him! lol i guess <propmale> will have to learn to go faster to catch him  playful 
"<propmale> is able to get anywhere he wants now  it's not quite a crawl, but very close  he uses his arms and legs together now   love  he's slow   but i bet that won't last long "
"just got back from a day at <propfirst>'s parents house  <propmale> did great in the beginning, but got a little overwhelmed by all the noise when everyone else arrived  we get him home and he's laughing out loud and chasing the dog  where was this enthusiasm earlier??"
