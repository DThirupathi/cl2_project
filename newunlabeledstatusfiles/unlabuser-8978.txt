"working 7 days a week, 30 hours a week  it's not as bad as i thought it would be, but knowing that i don't have a whole day to myself is a bit frustrating "
"im just one dm away from my next belt, and i have to wait a whole month just to get the one technique *sad face* atleast i know everything else pretty well "
"life is encased in shadow, waiting for time to reveal your future  your past was illuminated, but remains a faint glow dimly lit by memory  the present glows constantly, but cannot give light to the past or radiate the path ahead "
"the wisdom of our creed is revealed through these words  we work in the dark and serve the light  nothing is true, everything is permitted "
"out of all the reasons to live, i find people to be the only one that really truly matters  i have had some of the darkest thoughts enter my mind but memories of friends and family always brightens my day "
how can i make up my mind? make up goes on your face 
"whoever decided that selling a super supreme with double toppings was plausible should die     it doesn't even completely cook right, i mean really? i hate customer service sometimes    "

call of duty: run around > aim > shoot > hit hit hit hit hit hit hit > enemy turns around knifes and teleports 10 feet to you  being good at video games is serious business

one day i want to copy somebody's status word for word and see if they notice 
"i asked god this  if i am so strong, why do i keep falling? if i work so hard, why does it never pay off? if i give life my best shot, why is my best never good enough? he replied simply  because you are so strong, work so hard, and always try your best, you will overcome every challenge "
