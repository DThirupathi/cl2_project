today was fun  i totally fail at bowling but it was great
i really don't want to go back to school
break has hardly started and i'm incredibly bored already
"stupid, moronic   grrr"
"\true love lasts forever\"" that would be so great if it were actually true!"""
"i'm tired, frusturated, and kind of really pissed off at him   "
take a moment and look at me i'm not the same person i was
"fell in and out of love, lost friends, had amazing e playful eriences  so can't wait to write my memoir  2011!"

it was actually semi-warm today!
"well, french was unusually fun   "
guess what! its the weekend!
it looks so nice out  i half want to just go outside and run around barefoot but that means i'd have to change out of my pjs   
three day week!
i'm so looking forward to the weekend even though i was only at school for three days   
"you know, this week could have started out better but at least i passed the trig tests (so far) pros can outweigh the cons  smile "
"chris: \jessica simpson?\"" me: \""parabola?\"""""
this day has been so great  mrs  kuntz is amazing!
there's something i wish would happen but everytime i try to figure out what it is i forget  kinda annoying but w e this day was great
i'm so bad at 'comforting' people yet they still come to me  i love the fact that they trust me enough to come to me but i usually have no clue what to say   
someone should kidnap me for the weekend   
we need like another week for the weekend 
<propfirst> has a book and knows how to use it  my headache is proof enough
i'm so happy
i don't know why i feel so crappy but i do and i'm incredibly pissed off at just about everyone 
i passed my driving license test!  smile 
i will make varsity  i will 
so looking forward to thursday's meet
"mom: \quick look for them!\"" me: \""are they going someplace?\"" (in relation to 3 hour burning logs that were $15)"""
"yay, i am so happy about my trig test  i hope my algebra ii test is just as easy!"
i was so excited about my math tests and strength and conditiong (even though i totally tripped over that one dude and ran into the other) but then sickness decided that it was time to call
so happy to be back at school! i miss too much being sick   
"i absolutely love <propfirst>! she's so much fun to be around and math  oh, wow"
"chris: the ice cream is tickling my throat   yes, my throat is ticklish  me: the inside or outside? chris: um, both? (i love my sister  love )"
16 days left then most days will be like today  can't wait
"yay, i get to go to one acts tonight! time to get out of the house for like the first time all week : )"
"goals for the week annoyed chem lab, trig test, get all make-up alg ii homework in, do chem homework, turn in trig missing assignments, and french 5 sentences \psh, i can totally do this!"
"okay <propfemale>, i'm not really sure what i did but fine i'll take this  thanks for biting me on the butt, now please, pretty please, smack him in the face "
i'm going with that if i open and close the doors on the fridge and pantry enough times something good will magically appear
betrayal is inevitable in any relationship
"yay, only 4 more finals!"

"yay, feeling better    which means i might be able to get out of the house this week and do stuff with my friends!  love  you guys"
worst day of my life  anyone hate me and would kill me in blind rage right now cause i could use that
best night  haven't laughed that hard in a while  so strange that i can be this happy even considering what's happened 
"well, i'm kind of bored of summer  anyone wanna do something this weekend or whenever?"
just saw a full rainbow  rainbows are suppose to be symbols of hope  sadly it faded shortly after i saw it  i wonder if the indicates fading hope?
"weekend, finally  even though its summer i need this weekend "

"guys are immature, insensitive jerks "
its a relief to be leaving sunday  i really can't wait
"this has not been my week, actually month  things better get better by next sunday or i'm probably going to severly hurt myself "
okay so i must have been in a state of numbness for the past like 2 weeks or w e cause i think it's finally hit me that i'm alone cause last night when kaite burger claimed me as hers <propfirst> hood wasn't there to dispute that claim  i miss my life

it might be a good idea for me to not drive  i think there needs to be a law saying that in order to drive you must not be really frickin' pissed off or crying (visibility issues)  especially when there's ice on the roads
