"sometimes in life, you know you can't have something  but that only makes you want it more and try harder to get it "
"the world is full of love  a soulmate's true love, a mother's and father's unconditional love, a friend's eternal love, a brother's unsaid love, a sister's emotional love  to recieve even one is a treasure worth living a million lifetimes, thru the pain, hardship, & uncertainty  to all who love me, you are the reason my heart still beats, the reason my lips still smile, & the reason my soul has so much love to give"
"loves backseat dance parties more than anyone, ever did!"

"even when life is changing, even when it gets tough, even when u think its never gonna be like it was, u cant give up  u have to remember that in the end it will all be ok  that no matter what happens u always have those u love, those that are there for u  you u always have god and ur beliefs  nothing can take that from u "
