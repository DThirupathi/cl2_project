"i'm ready for this week to end, and to just have a fun weekend "
going to enjoy my weekend
"i am ready for the weekend to be here already, and i'm glad that this summer intercession is almost over "
doesn't like speeches when you have to do so much stuff for it    i can't believe the blackhawks lost to the flyers today
i really hate how speech has all these requirements in order to do a specific speech
"will never forget and will always remember a great man, great cousin who has been the greatest he could ever be  he had always brought comedy to the family gatherings, and i will always miss it  will always remember the times when we would <propfemale> out together as kids, and bug my aunt's and uncle's  i will always remember <propfirst> hermes, june 23, 2010 "
"boston, <propfemale> is best place to go claming and eating lobster and crab on the beach "

mosquito's are the devil
"a mere friend will agree with you, but a real friend will argue \\(russian proverb)"

"twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do  so throw off the bowlines  sail away from the safe harbor  catch the trade winds in your sails  e playful lore  dream  discover \\(<propfirst> twain)"
"it is not possible for one to teach others who cannot teach his own family \\(confucius)"

i think school is trying to kill me with multiple tests this week and next week 
frustrated with stats homework    someone help
\you realize life goes by way to fast," but its the matter of taking the time to spend at that specific moment to enjoy it longer \""\"63da08b723fbd9a14055ed70a582f7e0,i hate how teachers like to coordinate all there tests and big essay's on the exact same week  please stop doing this    
wishing i didn't lose an hour of sleep   sad
