to me when it comes to men and child support  it wouldnt bother me so much not to have financial support if the father of the child would at least spend time with the kid  to me that is what kids who have no father want  that is why it is so easy for women to find male father figures  most men what a kid or kids to <propfemale> out with but they dont ever want to have to pay for them 
"you know everything about me  you won't tell anyone my secrets  you are the one person i can't live without \\     i love you mom  smile \\(if you feel the need to repost this go head!)"

<propfirst> and names are so cool  i have been studying astrology and numberology and how they affect our daily lives  including those who are notorious for crime  if one was to look at for example <propfirst> manson  one would see that something was bound to happen due to name and astrology chart 
"made speghetti for supper, should have seen <propfemale>'s eyes when i brought out the parmeson cheese  she was all googly eyed "
