"on a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?"
will i lose my dignity? will someone care? will i wake tomorrow from this nightmare?
"here i go again on my own, going down the only road i've ever known    "
you got something to say? then dont be a coward and say it to my face i'll let you know right where i am      
"i am going to say this once and only once, if you wish to speak on a subject that you a)know nothing about except some rumors maybe  b)have only one side of the story  or c) just have to get your licks in, then have the testicular fortitude to say it to me in person, or keep my name out of your mouth "
is not satisfied with the snow in the least      and damn that black ice!
is off to see <propmale>!
it's snowin again! dunno if i should be happy or annoyed  i'll figure it out over lunch *noms*

about to cuddle under 33 1 2 dead fraggles and finish my book  joyful  
"we never said our love  was evergreen, or as unchanging as the sea - but if you can still  remember, stop and think  of me    "
where are my cats? tell me how can two cats disappear out of a house that is supposedly locked whenever people leave without someone who has a key coming in and taking them? this really upsets me
