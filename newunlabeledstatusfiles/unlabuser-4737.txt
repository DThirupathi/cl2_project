oh and i close my eyes and you and i are stuck on the farris wheel rockin with the motion and hand in hand we cried and laughed knowin that love belonged to us girl if only for a moment
get caught in the race of this crazy life tryin to be everything can make you lose your mind  i just wanna go back in time
this is my temporary home its not where i belong windows and rooms that im passin through this is just a stop on the way to where im going im not afraid because i know this is my temporary home
i just want to make sure you know just who youre getting under this old hat cause girl im not the kind to two time or play games behind your back im a little more country than that
without saying a word you can light up the dark try as i may i could never e playful lain what i hear when you don't say a thing
and if it looks like we were scared to death like a couple of kids just trying to save each other you should have seen it in color a pictures worth a thousand words but you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered you should have seen it in color
we love it - we hate it - we're all just trying to make it in this crazy town
same old boy same sweet girl ten years down the road he held her tight and kissed her lips in front of the picture show
rain makes corn corn makes whiskey whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
i  love  <propmale> track and field athletics
just when i thought it couldnt get no hotter i caught glimpse of the farmers daughter
drive until the city lights dissolve into a country sky just me and you   free as we'll ever be
scars heal <propfemale> fades and all we're left with are the memories made pain hurts but only for a minute yeah life is short so go on and live it cause the chicks dig it
when i hear your name i feel rain fallin right out of the blue sky and its the fifth of may and im right there starin in your eyes and nothins changed and we're still the same and i get lost in the innocence of a first kiss and im hangin on to every word rollin off of your lips and thats all it takes and im in that place every time i hear your name
yeah shes good when shes bad shes cute when shes mad and she does all the wrong things right yeah boy its a fact when theyre made like that you aint ever gonna sleep at night
baby im on my way to come and get ya meet me at the end of your drive grab your shades and your string bikini   i know a spot down on the river underneath the sycamore tree save all your kisses up bring on your sweet love pour it all over me
my felicitations to all graduating friends  i'll miss you guys 
you've got willing arms that'll hold you tight a hand to lead you on through the night right here i know your heart can get all tangled up inside but don't you keep it to yourself; when your long day is over and you can barely drag your feet the weight of the world is on your shoulders i know what you need bring it on home to me
you wear your smile like a summer sky just shining down on me and you i swear your heart is a free bird on a lazy sunday afternoon i love the way that you're up for anything and never worry bout what people say
phone gone  if you need to get ahold of me you can text <propfemale> or call my house phone  329-6959
"when i'm a ship tossed around on the waves, up on a highwire thats ready to break when i've had just about all i can take, baby you save me"
i'm gonna live where the green grass grows
"there's always that one person that will always have your heart you never see it coming cause you're blinded from the start know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see ooh baby, you will always be my boo"
"i believe in memories they look so, so pretty when i sleep hey now, and when i wake up, you look so pretty sleeping next to me but there is not enough time, and there is no, no song i could sing and there is no, combination of words i could say but i will still tell you one thing we're better together  -<propfirst> <propmale>"
"we gotta start makin' changes learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers and that's how it's supposed to be how can the devil take a brother if he's close to me? i'd love to go back to when we played as kids but things changed, and that's the way it is"
"today that's good enough for me, breathing in and out's a blessing can't you see, todays the first day of the rest of my life, and i'm alive and well, yeah i'm alive and well"
you and me go fishin' in the dark
you gonna feel my rush you don't feel it then it must be too real to touch peel the dutch i'm about to tear shit up goosebumps yeah i'ma make your hair sit up-eminem
sometimes god gives us opportunities in life and we fuck it up  you just gotta keep goin' keep livin' hopin one day you'll get another <propmale> and you'll do it right 
"life is too short to put it off anymore you gotta live it before, it's too late can't turn that clock back around on what your dreamin about you better do it now don't wait"
lifes like a novel with the end ripped out
i don't see nothin wrong with a little bit of bump and grind
i got so many ya'll got dimes but i got twenties
her laughter fills my soul and when i hold her i don't wanna let go when it comes to her i can't get enough so it took me by complete surprise when my heart got lost in those deep green eyes she's not at all what i was looking for; she's more
"picture a place that they exist, together it has to be a place better then this, in heaven so right before i sleep dear god what i'm asking: remember this face, save me a place\in thug mansion "
cause love only comes once in awhile knocks on your door and throws you a smile and takes every breath and leaves every scar
so baby gimme that toot toot lemme give you that beep beep runnin her hands through my 'fro bouncin on 24's while they say on the radio   it's the remix to ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen mama rollin that body got every man in here wishin sippin on coke and rum i'm like so what i'm drunk it's the freakin weekend baby i'm about to have me some fun
but you'd have to walk a thousand <propmale> in my shoes just to see what it's like to be me i'll be you let's trade shoes just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain i'll feel mine go inside each others minds just to see what we'd find look at shit through each others eyes but don't let em say you aint beautiful they can all get fucked just stay true to you
"'cause i didn't know i needed you so\and letting you go was wrong\and baby i know you got your radio on\so this is my, my bad, come back song\\i know i said i wouldn't miss you\but now i'm saying i'm a fool\you're on the feel good side of leaving\and i'm the backside of a mule\\and i didn't know i needed you so\and letting you go was wrong"
eavesdropping should be considered a crime
life's too fun and i'm too young and the night ain't over yet; like i said i can sleep when i'm dead
"don't take life too seriously, no one lives through it "
"life's not the breaths you take, the breathing in and out, that gets you through the day,ainâ€™t what itâ€™s all about, you just might miss the point, trying to win the race, lifeâ€™s not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away"
chew me up and spit me out i fell for this so many times it's ridiculous and still i stick with this i'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction your addictive as they get evil as they come
