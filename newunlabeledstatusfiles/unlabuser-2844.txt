happy new year! may all your resolutions come true!
how 'bout them cowboys!
"i'm disappointed about the cowboys  i am, however, seeing a saints-colts super bowl in our near future  awesome!"
"i'm a little late in getting in on the look-alike thing, but here you go "

"what's the difference between a salschow, a toe loop, a lutz, and a flip? they all look the same to me "
"i recently encountered a question that i think bears repeating   if <propfirst> cracked corn, but no one cared, why is there a song about him?  playful "
"usa!usa!usa!,etc   laugh "
this is for all you idol fans  1) vftw saved <propfemale>  2) where were all the <propfirst> fans? i mean really  <propfirst> park and <propmale> urban were much worse than him  3) i'll miss you <propfemale>!
"rats! oh, well  we tried "
hating <propfirst> park
"jammin' guitar, but the vocals aren't workin' for <propfirst>"
that's two  he's become a serial killer  todrick must be stopped!

"acid reflux is the bane of my existence! ifinally managed to get past a <propmale> problem i encountetred while eating my dinner  for those who knew, and were praying, thank you "
the last 3-4 girls should be safe  so should ms  bowersox  the rest are in trouble 
vftw strikes again!

"i was born in denver,colorado  i didn't get an accent until i got to texas  then i lost it again when i had it trained out of me by a voice teacher "
i finally decided to join twitter  i must really be bored 
"well, i guess there isn't a good reason to keep watching the tournament now  no one is left that i care about "

"it was cool to see dr  holcomb last night  his hair is getting shaggy  if he ever decides to stop styling it, he could go for the \leopold\"" look """
"<propfirst> and mamasox are the best of the night! i'm not sure what will happen with the others  this is idol gives back, no one gets voted off on that week "
(warning: inside joke to follow) the difference between baseball and soccer is you aren't allowed to hit the ball with a big stick in soccer   playful

we're off to boston!
today we switch to the scientific part of our tour 
"i think <propfirst> and big <propfirst> are in trouble  i liked <propfirst>'s song better than the judges  i do, however, agree with tem on the duets and crytal's song "
go <propfirst> and <propfemale>! on to the finals!
my mom is the best ever!
to everyone: thank you for your birthday wishes  i have had a fantastic day!
hannibal the klingon was the first mistake
i was hoping that <propfirst> had more talent  i did like the light show at the beginning 
"i have a theory that most people in the world are crazy  of course, that means that the sane people are abnormal   playful "
i decided to update my profile with a more professional photo
today's new musicals need to have their mouths washed out with soap
i hereby banish all nightmares from my room  i've got to get some sleep  g'nite facebookland!
happy father's day to all the dads (including my own)!
wow  great first quarterfinal match for uruguay
chicago has the best talent! wow!
i agreed with all the picks except miss romer  i thought that strange familiar was a much better act  (<propfemale>'s got talent)
listening to music from lord of the rings trilogy  thy did such a fantastic job! i can picture evry scene based on what music is being played 
<propfirst> was the funniest tonight  that bit about the deer was hilarious!
why <propfemale>? why would you vote for these irritating people over true talent?
a very disappointing outing by the cowboys
"why is it that when most people have a problem with me, they avoid me? i've never understood that "
some of these 18 -wheelers are getting out of control  i just had one try to run me off the road! my driver-side mirror is gone 
"wow, what a great night for <propfemale>'s got talent!"
"driving a rental car in the rain, plus i have to work nights for the next 2 weeks  i'm glad i had a good weekend "
had fun in auditions last night  can't wait to find out the results 
never allow pain and paranoia to fuel your imagination  i need some laughter desperately right now 
poor passing by romo  weird change in defensive strategy in the second quarter  an inconsistent kicker  it's a good thing i'm a pro football fan and not just a <propmale> 
"they have begun offering roles for \a christmas carol\""  this is gonna be awesome!"""
<propmale> scandrick is a menace to the team!
i am feeling it  go rangers!!!!!!
"thanks for being a killjoy, <propmale> <propmale>!"
first half: positive- our quarterback is fighting hard for us  negative- we have no discipline  go cowboys!
<propfirst> <propmale> is a disaster!
go benji! we can still do this!
hamilton strikes again!
that last not was just a <propmale> flat 
"okay, this sucks  we need outs!"
thank you <propmale> and young!
i was just wondering something  are the yankees worried yet?
"feeling under the weather  unfortunately, i can't stay home  i need the day to go fast "
3 outs away! you can almost taste it 
the rangers win the pennant! in your face a-rod!
i hope that fullback is proud of himself  romo is probably out for the season 
i'm over the cowboys  there are better teams i can watch this season  go rangers!
"eight songs down, three to go! (4 if you count \rhinestones on my touche\"")"""
this is not the game i envisioned  at least our offense is trying 
this game reminds me of game 5 from the alcs 
"dumb, kinsler "
"good news for today: the mavericks won last night, and the rangers still have 6 games to play in the world series!"
i don't think we can come back from being 2 games down  it will still be an awesome run for our rangers!
did i say the series was over? no! why would i say something like that? go rangers!
awesome season for the rangers  sad ending  we'll bring the claw and antlers next year!
"recording for \a christmas carol\"" today  this is gonna be awesome!"""
"sorry, <propfirst>, but you don't have much of a choice  either fire <propmale> or face the possibility that no one will come to the home games "
i'm trying to decide if i even care who is going to the super bowl this year  none of the teams seem to care 
"i want to laugh, cry, scream, and sleep all at the same time  how is that possible?"
for all that you've done and are still doing for us - thank you veterans!
i get to work a double shift today        hooray
"don't anybody look now, but the cowboys just outplayed the giants in the 1st quarter "
that's a whole 1st half where the cowboys played at this level 
and the cowboys did it!
"distractions  they come in many different forms  to me, the most insidious is when others try not to distract you  their absence is very distracting to me "
"okay, i saw <propmale> potter last night  i enjoyed the movie except for the scene where <propmale> destroys the horcrux  the nudity was totally unnecessary "
last rehearsal for a whole week  time to rest my voice for a while 
"happy thanksgiving! i am grateful for all my loved ones  i am grateful for my god-fearing church family  most of all, i'm grateful that jesus saved me from myself "
"okay, i've got my plan for black friday  let the christmas season commence!"
i was doing fine on my shopping spree    until i got to the galleria  today is not the day to go there folks!
mini-vacation over  nose meet grindstone  ugh

"change your \fb profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood  the goal is not to \see a human face on fb until monday, december 6th  join the fight \against child abuse & copy & paste to your status and invite \your friends to do the same"

"getting ready to head to day #2 of \a chhristmas carol\"" at first baptist carrollton  it just keeps getting better!"""
one more day in victorian england  they sure sang a lot back then 
"my last note on \a christmas carol\"": <propfirst>- this will definitely become my favorite version! <propfirst> s - i think i speak for all the \""scoundrels\"" when i say thank you for making us look so good! my fellow cast members- you were all awesome!"""
"is there such a thing as \musical lag\""? my internal chronometer feels off """

<propfemale> christmas from all of me to all of you 
i got fantasia fantasia 2000 dvd for christmas  watching it now  they need to make a new one 
"i enjoyed several movies this past year, but my top 5 were: 1) inception 2) book of <propmale> 3) tron annoyed egacy 4) the a-team 5) the sorcerer's apprentice"
the worst thing you could wish on someone is that they die alone 
they are working on a universal translator app  one step closer to <propfemale> trek!
the green hornet  meh
(sigh)
bible study was very interesting tonight  it's too bad that some people had to miss it 
i'm in the zone  hoping the trend continues 
"to varying degrees, we always want the approval of the people we love  it may sound obvious, but think about the ramifications "
it's been an up and down kind of day  good thing i don't get motion sickness anymore 
"i've been in a lousy mood all day  choir helped some, but i'm still stewing  hopefully, tomorrow will be better "
i've said it before: don't let someone with my imagination stay in a bad mood for too long 
"just finished watching the dvd of \a christmas carol\""  that was some great camera work!"""
i'll be at camp compass for the next few days  they'll probably make a tv movie about our survival story 
"snow days are for catching up  on sleep, on tv, etc "
"a cancer patient only has one wish, to kick cancer's butt  i know that 97% of you won't post this as your status, but my friends will be the 3% that do  in honor of someone who died or is fighting cancer, post this for at least one hour"
just got my first e playful erience with the wii  i just about hyperextended my elbow trying to bowl strikes  taking a break from that 
i'm off to work  i may not be able to access fb for a while  i hope everyone stays safe and warm 
being home is awesome!
"i'm glad i made it home yesterday  otherwise, i might not have been home until tomorrow afternoon! this weather is insane!"
i'm predicting a lot of november babies born in texas this year 
"the nfl e playful erience sounds awesome, but i think i'd rather wait and see the hall of fame one of these years  (during the summer)"
"nfl hof class of '11 was just announced  i agree with most of the picks, but 3 great receivers and <propfirst> <propfemale> were snubbed  there were a couple on the class list that could've waited i think "
"gotta say, that was one of the best sb games i've ever seen  kudos to both teams! (not so much to the \singers\"")"""
here we go again
"compared to last week, today was a snap  still, it's good to be home "
the nfl has descended into childishness  i think i'll watch soccer this year  go fc <propfirst>!
finally going to see true grit  i hope it's worth the wait 
"today i stand with the teachers, support staff, administrators and school boards of texas who are fighting for the education of children in texas  to the texas legislature i say: make education a priority  i hope you will change this to your status for the rest of the day"
jury duty  ugh 
double shifts the rest of the week and all next week  my joy overfloweth  (was that sarcasm over the top?)
i'm off to my audition with amtc  wish me luck!
"okay oscars, i'm bored so far  hooray for inception!"
"so far, they are spreading the wealth  true grit is the only film getting the brush "
boo! i liked the score for inception better

"just watched last night's <propfemale>  most of the girls should worry as should stefano  i would add <propfirst> to that list, but he seems to have a big following for now  <propfirst> durbin was my favorite of the night "
i've got a full weekend of training in store at amtc  should be fun and exhausting!
what's the <propfemale> got to do with it? please make the torture stop!
"why am i watching <propfemale> again? other than thia, no one has stayed on key so far "
"finally! thanks, stefano  i thought we were never going to hear a good one tonight!"
<propfirst> is weird 
"much better, <propmale>  can we please say goodbye to naima?"
"warning!! as of today - facebook will automatically start dragging the earth into the sun  to change this option, go to settings > planetary settings > trajectory then unclick the box that says 'apocalypse ' facebook kept this one quiet  copy & paste onto your status for absolutely no good reason whatsoever "
