forgiveness comes hard to many people about a lot of things    but the only way we could ever have the right to not forgive others is if we've never had to ask for forgiveness for ourselves  which means that no one has the right to keep a grudge because everyone makes mistakes  it's what makes us human  (on another note: working on scholarship essays -- text me if you need me)
