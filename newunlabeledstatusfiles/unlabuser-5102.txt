"strangest thing   <propfirst> woke me up at 3am, asking if i smelled smoke  we went out into the kitchen and turned on the light and you could see very subtle clouds of smoke rolling around on the ceiling  we searched the entire place, but couldn't find the source of it  so then, of course, we were afraid to go to sleep  the last thing i remember <propfirst> saying to me was, \see you in the morning  i hope \"""""
hot and steamy baby!!  smile 
"you reach in and grab a handful, but before you shovel it in, you noticed there was, sitting triumphantly atop the less priviledged, was the perfect piece of popcorn  so beautifully buttery and fat   it also just happens to be the only piece that flips out of your hand and lands on the floor  figures "
"ok i'm passin it on  during this week please change your profile picture to someone famous (actor ,musician,athelete) you have been told you look like    post this to your profile and message your friends with it   "
"kids in bed, bored outta my mind waiting for <propfirst> to get home from work so we can watch the final season premier of lost!! you don't know how hard it is for me to see it sitting on the dvr and not push play   "
"my brother, <propmale>, has been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, and they're talking about possible congestive heart failure  it's not looking good   sad  please keep him in your thoughts and prayers   "
"happy anniversary, <propfemale> and eddie!! smile "
"i just posted this, but i'm so annoyed, i wanna post it again  i'm waiting semi-patiently on a shipment of <propmale> supplies so i can paint some pieces that i need special brushes for   and this snow is screwing everything up!! it's either snowing, or it's sunday, or it's freakin president's day   this shipment is never gonna get here!! and i'm sooooo in the mood to paint! dammit!"
i swear    getting my 3 year old to clean her room is like trying to make a man jump into a pool of piranhas   it just ain't happenin   
i love it  <propfirst> just cut <propfemale>'s hair with the clippers and my little blondie has a dime-sized brown patch of hair on the back of his head! lol almost just as good as <propfemale>'s hair suddenly growing in bleach blonde at about 6 months old so it looked like we had dyed her hair darker cuz her roots were gleaming white  lol
"i went outside to let the heathens pee (the dogs, not the kids) and an insanely strange impulse surged through me  as i looked at the snow perched like a mountain on top of the tarp covering <propfirst>'s bikes, i rationalized with myself, saying it was just my inner child shining through  it didn't work  i tried to shoo it away, but it just kept nagging at me  so, i did it    i bent over and smashed my face in the snow "
"sorry for my hiatus guys  lol  let's just say i have a total skunkbag for a landlord  he had our cable and internet shut off, posing as <propfirst>  but i'm back! i went thru total fb withdrawals! ha!"
"it's my little man's first birthday!! he woke up in such a good mood  <propfirst>, alyx and i were saying happy birthday to him and he kept giggling! lol i'll try to post pics of the cake smashing later   "
"so after the whole fiasco in which our landlord had our cable and net shut off, we get it turned back on and a few days later, our computer is attacked by a freakin virus   it was an anti virus posing as a virus to make us buy their software (avg)  it disabled everything  got it fixed tho   bastards "
"well, i've started the looooong road to weight loss! i'm determined to get rid of this damn baby belly!! i'm doing the flat belly diet  i've heard good things about the book, which i have  i also have the cookbook  the food doesn't look too bad either    and you can eat dark chocolate on this diet!!! hellz yeah!!!"
"please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone, who needs a punch in the face  people who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many  there is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face, except a punch in the face, but we can raise awareness"
"yeah, now our furnace is kaput  we're trying to figure out if it's the actual furnace or just the thermostat   just what we need  <propfirst>'s replacing the thermostat now, so everyone keep your fingers crossed that that's it  if not, well at least the temps aren't freezing right now  at least it's a <propfemale> 50-degree day  it's actually warmer outside than inside!!"

"omg   i watched lost last night   this poop is getting really good! kudos to <propfirst> <propmale> (<propmale> linus) for some very impressive acting  i actually got choked up there for a few minutes, a feeling i never would have imagined to be invoked by <propmale>! i'm tryin not to give any spoilers, tiff, since i know you and ant are only on season 3, but holy cow, wait til you get to the final season!!! it's off the freakin hook!"
"is anyone as pissed off about the prom cancellation in mississippi as i am? it's 2010, people, it's time to stop being embarrassed over gays and lesbians (even if you're against it)  they're everywhere, whether we like it or not, and to ban a couple lesbians from attending prom is a violation of rights   point blank "
"well, it's early and already, <propfemale> has a 'tude  that boy has a short ass temper! and he's sneaky to boot   "
"okay, guys, i need some help  there's an old <propfirst> gatlin song    one of lesser known ones   it's about two people, a man and a woman    and i'm thinking there's something about a bed in it   i wanna hear it so bad, but i can never find it anywhere!!! dad was the one who used to play it all the time, so, dad, if you ever get on fb, now is the time!! lol"

sittin here on fb and watching spongebob with the kiddies  smile  i'm also conjuring up some ideas for a new painting   and we all know what a great inspiration spongebob is!!
"well, for those who are interested, i will soon have all my paintings online, with a website  this is all in the works, so i don't know my web address yet  i'm so freakin anxious!! then i'll be motivated to paint all the time!!  laugh "
"was feelin a bit under the weather   could've been the disgusting white stuff i awakened to this morning (talkin about the snow, get your mind outta the gutter!!)  so, i did my hair, and put on some bar-hoppin makeup just cause i could, and now i feel so energized and ready for a night @ home with the little people!!  smile  yay!"
"well, it's official  <propfemale> can walk now!! he is sooooo proud of himself  he'll toddle around the room and when he stops or falls down, he claps for himself  of course, i'm clapping right along with him!  smile  he's such a big boy!!"
"aaaahhh    laying out in the sun, kiddies outside playing, sagers is napping   i'm in a great mood today!!! maybe i can use this time to catch up on reading    smile "
"sketched out an awesome painting idea last night   i've been so artistically blocked lately, but this one just flowed  i hope it's the beginning of the much needed painting streak i have so desperately been waiting for  now just to contemplate hues and background   "
"alright, i'm doin it    i'm goin back to blonde  i don't know how much i'll like it, i just want something different   but, i'm not gonna cut it again! why don't people just smack me when i do shit like that? why do i have to be so stubborn?"
"well, i've been a sketchin fool lately  i've done no paintings, but i have drawn out 4 sketches to paint when i feel up to it   since <propfemale> has now started walking, we can no longer keep him within the confines of the living room  i have to <propmale> him everywhere, so it looks like i won't be painting again til the newness wears off   oh well, as long as stops dumping the dog water all over himself sometime soon   "
is wondering why so many people let the petty crap bother them   including myself? i hate petty crap  it serves no function or purpose and only pisses people off   
i try to clean    then these lil ankle gnomes scurry behind me and blow dust and pet furries back on everything   then the brownies go and hide my dustrag  that's it! i'm on strike!!!
"no matter what kind of day i've had, once i put on my big fluffy pink and purple slippers, everything gets a little better  smile "

"ok, mama is one pissed off lady   for some reason, lost didn't record, so <propfirst> and i missed it  we're having a <propmale> bitch fest in honor of time <propmale> cable for providing us with such excellent service   bastards "
ugh  ate some baaaad taco hell last night  lets just say i had to move my bathroom party to the one out in the front hallway at 5am as opposed to using the one in our bedroom  i would have awakened <propfemale> and <propfirst> if i kept getting in and out of bed  i still feel awful    no more chalupas or mexican pizzas for me for awhile   
"<propfemale> n <propfemale> are down for naps at the same time, <propfirst> is playing outside, and alyx is outside fulfilling a punishment  i finally get some mommy time!!! think i'll work on a series of sketches i've started  just sketches    no painting involved  sometimes i just like to create in gray and white    subtle  soft shading and creepy shadows   smile "

"is pretty unhappy with the series finale of lost  this was a plot that everyone had guessed back in season 2   however, i do like how they made all the significant couples partners remember each other    i especially loved <propfirst> and <propfemale>'s reunion, and sawyer and <propfemale>'s wasn't bad either! but, c'mon! seriously? that's it?? this is not how i wanted it all to end!! i feel very let down   "

"yeah, so my night sucked  it could've been much, much worse tho  we were just leaving to take tay back to <propmale>, when i realized i had forgotten to stop at shamrah's first, so i turned around and just as i pulled in her drive, my front passenger tire splits  as if i needed this   if it's not one thing, it's another "
