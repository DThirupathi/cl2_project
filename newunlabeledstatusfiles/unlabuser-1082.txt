thanks to <propfemale> miller i finally have a photo profile 
monday's are depressing enough without it being so crappy outside too!
"i meditate, i burn candles, i drink green tea    and still i want to smack someone! and it's only 10 smile 0am!"
<propfemale>'s office has no ac!  it's sort of like working in a f    g sauna 
thank god we have ac again!  no more sticking to stuff 
will the weekend never get here?
what a great day!  for the first time in years i don't have to spend the day being a hypocrite! it feels marvelous!
girls day night out is finally here !
