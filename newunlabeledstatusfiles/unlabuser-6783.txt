"gone like a freightrain, gone like yesterday,  gone like a soldier in the civil war bang bang, gone like a 59 cadillac, like all those good things that ain't never coming back   well she is gone"
where do you draw the line between chaos and structure?    how do you know if what you did wasn't a complete mocary of who you are and what you symbolize?    
all your life you were only waiting for this moment to arrive   and now its gone
please love me do
she smashed her knuckles into winter as autumns warmth fades into black she is the saint of all the sinners the one thats fallen through the cracks
you think you lost your love when i saw her yesterday its you she is thinkin of and she told me what to say
maybe i shouldn't think of you   as mine
every street i walk on i leave teardrops on the ground all because of a girl i didn't want around
he blew his mind out in a car he didn't notice that the lights had changed a crowd of people stood and stared they'd seen his face before
somebody asked me once if i loved them enough to tell them the truth    what do you think?
your gonna lose that girl
yes yes your gonna lose that girl
oh man
the moments and events we once had are not gone
hit me baby one more time
lost in the thick fog of time
she told me her name was    billie <propfirst> a she caused a scene
if i lose everything in the fire i'm sending all my love to you
oh shit    i think i'm gonna do it   i have to do it
with every breath that i am worth here on earth i'm sendin all my love to you   so if you dare to second guess you can rest assured that all my love is for you my beating heart belongs to you i walked for <propmale> till i found you
throw up your arms into the sky    you and i
i drank the water from the hurricane and i set a fire just to see the flame
if i lost you in the fire how did i ever make it through?
i txt a postcard sent to you did it go through?
ground control to <propmale> bullshit
nobody likes you everyone left you their all out without you having fun
"as of today 4,346 soldiers have died in the iraq war since it started in march of 2003   hmmm   does it seem worth it now?"
if i could find you now things would get better we could leave this town and run forever
i need to find a place to hide you never know what could be waiting outside the accidents that you could find it's like some kind of suicideso what ails you is what impales you i feel like i've been crucified to be satisfiedi'm a victim of my symptom i am my own worst enemy you're a victim of your symptom you are your own worst enemy know your enemy
what happened to it all   ?
we are fucked although we aren't the same
when i walk in crowded rooms  i feel as if it is my doom  i know that i don't belong  in that room i see her  i see her and she's with him  i turn and then i'm gone
your running after somethung that you'll never kill if this what you want than fire at will
is gonna die
when you are at the end of  the road and you lost all sense of control and your thoughts have taken their toll and your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
darling you've got to let me know   should i stay or should i go
does anybody want to start a war?
nobody wants him  he just stares at the world  planning his vengeance  that he will soon unfold  now the time is here  for his time to spread fear  vengeance from the grave  kills the people he once saved nobody helps him  now he has his revenge
it's all over coming to a screeching halt all around me breaking into peices right before my very eyes   and for what?
i'm looking down at this mess that you've made and i can't believe that i stayed so unhappy for so long where did i go wrong? i've got to get out of here my hand is on the handle i'm leaving everything behind goodbye for a lifetime
you don't know what it is like to listen to your fears
just kinda empty
do you dream to much?    do you think what you need is a crutch
the world is spinning around and around out of control again from the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down to send my love a letterbomb and visit me in hell
"black <propfemale> of death in my fist i clutch thorns shred my finger tips and drips toxic blood i'm rotting inside my flesh turns to dust whisper, â€œare you dying?â€� in my ear kiss me one last time wipe off my sweat whisper, â€œare you dying?â€� in my ear"
nobody helps him now he has his revenge
all day long i think of things but nothing seems to satisfy think i'll lose my mind if i don't find something to pacify
make a joke and i will sigh and you will laugh and i will cry

"turn off your mind, relax and float down stream it is not dying it is not  dying lay down all thought surrender to the void it is shining it is shining"

"a drink for the horror that i'm in   for the good guys and the bad guys for the monsters that i've been, cause ther ain't no way that i'm coming back again and    through it all how could you cry for me?"

there is a fine line between loving you and hateing you   and i'm on it
there is a fine line  between loving you and hateing you   and i'm on it(but i'm leaning towards hate)
who knows which is which and who is who?
we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish  bowl year after year   how i wish you were here
"did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? hot ashes for trees? hot air for a cool breeze? and cold comfort for change? did you exchange a walk on part in the war, for a lead role in a cage?"

"i will never falter, i'll stand my ground"
i built this with my own two hands
good-bye was a long time ago   we just didn't have the guts to admit it
just got slapped in the face by <propfemale>'s <propmale>
because i will live forever we don't belong together i know i'll feel better one day when i can make it through
"can anybody find me somebody to love? each morning i get up i die a  little can barely stand on my feet take a look in the mirror and  cry lord what you're doing to me i have spent all my years in  believing you but i just can't get no relief,"
damn   
i have put myself here i am the culprit
"i'm on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know right from the start i knew this day would come  there's nowhere left to run such a pretty picture, your chalk line on the ground, i hope you die"

"turn into a jet, like a boss, bomb the russians    like a boss"
have you ever rescued a swan?

"i want to break free, i've got to break free   god knows i want to break free"
"straight people don't know, what you're about they put you down and shut you out you gave to me a new belief and soon the world will love you sweet leaf"
will i ever find love?
"if my heart was still alive i know it would surely break,and my memories <propfemale>ft with you there's nothing more to say,  a tout <propfemale> monde, a tout mes amis je vous aime je dois partir, these are the last words i'll ever speak and they'll set me free "
if the war inside my head won't take a day off i'll be dead
"it's when hate turns to love and love to hate faith to doubt and doubts to faith now feeling turning your heart into stone feeling piercing your courageous soul beyond now, redemption no one's gonna catch you when you fall"
"iâ€™ve been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life   iâ€™m damaged from  the inside  iâ€™ve been broken   donâ€™t threaten me with what you think i feel   if you could read my mind youâ€™d be ashamed iâ€™m sick of your excuses  you hold above me   iâ€™ve finally come to terms with what i am   iâ€™m  nothing in your eyes, this will not change   iâ€™m living in a dream "
