for all you packers fan keep dreaming steelers are winning today so just forget it
ok so everyone sayin packers r gonna win might be a little disappointed later but u never know jk any steelers fan knows it all about the black and yellow today they might as well give <propmale> that 4th ring car and the money
so much yellow on the field i wish 25 <propfemale> would gone by already i wanna eat the strombolli i just made by hand
come on guys pull it together if steelers can get a touchdown then a two point conversion and then after that get a three point field goal they can tie it and go into overtime
