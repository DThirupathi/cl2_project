"i keep hesitating    but i don't want to anymore  maybe i shouldn't do this, but i'll follow my heart and if that doesn't work then what i thought was true really wasn't and boo you "
bff    when you have been talking to somebody and been friends for so long that they accept everything about you    and you don't realize they are your best friend until they randomly say it after 3 years of friendship    lol  playful

"it's hard when you lose somebody you care about  you can't talk to them when you need somebody anymore  it makes you feel lost and confused, and a million other emotions   but then in the middle of it all, you begin to realize who your real friends have always been, cause they are the ones who will let you vent and cry, and support you the entire time  thanks, you know who you are "
today was so amazing   had so much fun at the reunion and in heber afterwords 
"i love that moment when you reach the place you think you aren't going to reach, and you actually realize that you made it  now all that's left is to heal, it makes me so happy "

loves those long boring days where she can get lost in another world in her books 
"sometimes you know that you need to say something, but you also know that responding will hurt more then not "

i'm tired   but since that thing on saturday i haven't been able to sleep decently   may sleep come soon and for a very very long time   lol
"i cant' wait for school   i miss class    the only bad part is seeing people   lol, love ya guys"
"even a fake smile has some truth, even a tear cried in dispair has some hope  so live each moment fully, cause even though it seems the worst right now, you'll look back and realize, its what made you who you are, and that was the best thing that ever happened to you "
the last first day of forced education is tomorrow   next year it'll be all my fault   lol

"it's my personal opinion that if somebody wants to talk to you about something important, even if you are scared to talk to them, just do it  it might be one of the best things in your life   you won't regret it because that way nobody can say you didn't try "
"i like teh idea  although it was one i originally came up with   but who knows, maybe this time it'll make sense   they just have to agree"
"i forgot most of what i wanted to say   but then i realized, it doens't matter  people will act as they want, if they assume crap about me, then so be it  cause i deserve better then that   lol  smile "

"unfortunately most women won't re-post this  i'm strong willed,independent, and outspoken, i make mistakes, i am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best  if you're a  handful  then post this on       your status   i dare you!"
"sometimes things happen that you don't plan on  it might be good or bad  but if you let the bad things take over, then you'll never be able to enjoy the good  just remember love always exists, if it seems like you lost it, look in another place  i guarentee that it'll be there somewhere "

"sleep, the time where your mind shows you what you want in life   awake, the time where your life shows you what you have in life   dozing, where you imagine the best while knowing the worst  don't give up hope, but always remember the truth"
this weekend was fun  and i got a great idea for a peice of artwork to do   i just hope it'll turn out like i want it to
