my baby turned 14 today it just doesn't seem real where did all the time go?  also this is a warning to all he is old enough to have a drivers permit watch yourselves on the roads you never know where he might turn up  lol
today is a good day!!!!  i just found out i am going to be a grandmother again!!! and my puppy peanut was found in pleasant hill he is now home!!!!!!!!!!
i have basically split my heel almost in half i am now being medevaced out for both my elbow and my foot   i am on my way to germany in the next 48 hours from there i hope to be heading to the states soon   not the best way to go home but there it is 
"as many of you know i have been on deployment in kuwait these last 7-8 months   about a 2 month ago i started having problems with my elbow and the doctors decided to medevac me home to have more test   while waiting for the volcano ash to dissipate, i injured the heel of my foot "
well i am on my way to germany in about 6 hours   see you on the flip side
well i didn't make the cut   they picked up too many litter bound people in iraq so i am stuck here until wednesday morning   everyone pray that i get out of here then!
tonight is the night i leave for germany   hopefully i will not be stuck there very long   the flight doctor took a look at my x-rays and told me that not only is my heel split but that there are pieces of bone in my heel as well   i really hope this goes well 
"20 mintues until i board the plane i am so excited, just hope i am not stuck in germany too long "
"well i made it to germany, and today i have my first appointment they have to re-x-ray my heel, which they will make me straighten the foot fun fun fun,  really it is more painful than having my kids, there is always something to look forwatd to in the army   but at least i finally made it this far "
got to love the army  i showed up for my appointment 1 hour early and left the doctorâ€™s office 4 hours after my scheduled appointment  chances are they will admit me to the hospital tomorrow because we have to get the swelling down so when i am sent stateside they can do surgery   looking on leaving germany monday or tuesday 
"good news   i am out of here tomorrow   bad news they are sending me to ft  <propmale>, ks   it will be closer to home and my family will be able to come see me for my surgery which is good   but i really donâ€™t like ft  <propmale>   oh well as long as they fix me itâ€™s all good "
i am finally stateside i am at <propfirst> air base in illinois
i am finally stateside at <propfirst> air base in illinois  i fly to <propmale> tomorrow 
on my way to ft <propmale> on a c-130 not the best ride by far 
"i arrived at ft <propmale> wednesday afternoon, inprocessed thursday afternoon , and got the weekend off   i really wanted to start doctor appointments but stateside they do not work weekends   monday i hope to talk to all the doctors i need to so i can get surgery and move on to recovery "
"well i am going on week two of my stay at lovely fort <propmale>   still haven't gotten any appointments set up, but my case manager is working on it   got to love the army hurry-up and wait!!"
"good news finally!  after only 2 weeks of bull they have figured out that my foot is really messed up   and all it took was a trip to the podiatrist for them to finally decide i need an orthopedic surgeon   now things are finally moving, of course it is still going to be a long and painful process, not fun!  but at least i am starting the process "
"better news this morning   i visited the orthopedic surgeon, and i am having surgery monday morning   i donâ€™t have a lot of details for the recovery but i do know that i cannot put weight on the foot for at least 3 months and after that i can only but slight pressure on the toes   this is going to be a very long painful road "
well i am at the hospital going through surgery prep  love you all 
a stay of exacution
"well the stay of execution is over   tomorrow is the big day, the surgery will take about 2 hours and i have been promised a long painful recovery by my doctor, at least he is honest "
i made it out of surgery today at 1230  everything went well  they had to rebreak the heel clean up what was healing then place 2 2in screws in it to hold in place  lots of pain with this 
i am now offically on convalesent leave for 30 days   i do have an appointment on the 7th of june 
"just left the doctor's office, the foot looks great but it is still slightly"
"went to the doctor today, the foot looks good!!  they left the splint on for now the area around my incision is still slightly swollen, so i go back in 2 weeks to have the stitches removed and a full cast put on "
will the rain ever stop?
omg i cant believe this mom photographed her baby doing this: http annoyed  tinyurl com sickening-baby-pic
"my foot is doing a lot better, now it is on <propmale> to the elbow   so much fun!"
"i'm getting out of fort <propmale> yeah!!!!!!!  sunday i fly to <propfirst> then on to molin, got to love the army and how they make flight arrangements "
