"what else is life but a series of chances to touch and be touched; to  feel it all, to give it all, to invite it all in? the opportunity to  take this fragile, transient moment everyone is given and transform it  into <propmale> that few may ever see, but that will leave fingerprint  impressions on all who behold it  to send them forth with one message, make it matter  let the world be better because you are a p<propmale> of  it "
