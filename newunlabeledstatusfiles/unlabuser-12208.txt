just dont want the weekend to end   
life its never anything easy  how do you know what kind of person you truly are until your tested  to be able to withstand the darker side of your soul 
you ever shake a grow man so hard that they shit themselves?
your neighbors know my name!
great example of why i say women will never know what they want  watch episode 16 of the show called bones and you'll see why 
my mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark 
"<propmale>, bosh and lebron    oh yea 305 back in business  laker's who???"
"\you just killed a helicopter with a car!\"" \""i was out of bullets \"""""
"definition of m a n: <propmale> willis\for all you poser's watch any of his movies to make you feel more like a *****!!!"
on another level    you'll <propfemale> shine like me so why not just ride my coat-tails 
having trouble understanding life right now??!!
"t pain: \put it down\"" if you don't know bout it then you need to """
it seems that happiness is always fleeting but misery holds onto you compassionately 
damn 81 and rainy    love being in miami
guess back to work again
"2010\ is almost over! nows ur <propmale>  what's something uve always wanted to \tell me (inbox only)? put this as ur status and see what u get!"
