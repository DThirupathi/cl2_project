just recovering from massive over eating today 
"rough one today, <propfemale> was in rare form   my older girls were good though"
bout time brownies!!!!
guida lost to kenflo   i hate kenflo even more now   i think <propmale> may need to go back to the drawing board and beef up his jitsu 
i dug out my old army photo album and i'm off for the last 2 weeks of the year   i will use that time to scan and post so keep your eyes open 
tons o' stuff done on saturday; kailey got another assit in her indoor soccer game (tied 4:4); she is also having her sleep over b-day party (she was born on christmas so we have to have it early; and i won $53 dollars at qais's house playing poker!
"the browns had a heck of a showing    but against an terrible team   we'll have to wait and see but it looks like their run game is picking up, defense is a little rough and as always cribbs (fellow <propfemale> flash!) is still the best player on the team!"
is so thanksful qais and my daughter made me make a facebook site!  finding all kinds of old friends!
wishes everyone a very <propfemale> christmas
browns win again! (3 in a row? i didn't know that was possible!)

is off to california for the week   it will be good to see the plant but i'm gunna miss my wife and kiddies!  wishing you were there with me   
"one day down, the second under way   two good training sessions and some assessments complete   cool looking factory too, clean and visual kanban usage galore"
"so far so good, <propmale>, my san <propmale> counterpart knows the material well now and has taken over the training   spent a couple hours on the floor and have some ideas for him   "
i'll be home in less than 48 hrs   it was nice to see the sunset in the ocean again and the plant visit has been tre cool but i'm lokkin forward to home 
"just about to get on the plane home, hopefully we can land in akron, there is a storm abrewin which could be a pain   wish us luck  my wife told me <propfemale> started crawling this week, wish i could have been there   "
"we landed safely in some rough conditions, my hat's off to the pilot   it was a good trip but i'm excited to be home   <propfemale> crawled to me for the first time, too cool"
"just finished a book that <propmale> lent me   it is about what great managers do differently   fantastic book \first break all the rules\""   not sure i agree with everything but 90% sounds about right   any would be managers or someone who wants their managers to know how well you perform should read it """
"they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but i say you can learn a lot of new tricks from an old dog!"
"went over to qais's house last night for poker with $45   came home with -$10 and a lot of laughs   it was a good night, learned a couple of new and challenging games   "
"started our film line 4 waste kaizen event today   going very well   we taught 6 operators about some basic <propfemale> principles, cost reports and the power of root cause analysis   they are very receptive and participative   tomorrow will be the time to see how creative they are by applying the principals and making some changes on the line "
i forgot to post an update n saturday's poker game at qais's house   i actually won about $55!!! and had a <propmale> flush (natural) playing omaha!!!  qais did pretty good too   
"kailey scored 2 goals at her soccer game, one on a break away and the other was a free kick on a handball inside the goalie box   we won 5-4   defense was rough though  sad "
"my team lost 6-3 but with 3 people short and 5 new players i was happy with what they did right   lots of good passes, playing the positions and taking shots   we need a ton of defensive work   our goalie is brand new, but athletic and she blocked 8 shots   three of the goals scored on us were breakaways and 1 was our mistake (defense kicked it across the middle)!"
"got destroyed in soccer today, my primary goalie and defender were no shows and my back-up goalie (primary midfielder) did well but got ko'd   we aren't three deep in the goalie so     i took them for ice cream anyway lol"
"my soccer team lost again, but put up a hellova fight!  it was a 5-7 loss   the defense was okay, goalie not so much, gunna have to replace her with someone but not sure who   "
"kailey's soccer team tied 3-3 with 2nd ranked team in our division, <propfemale> turned 1 (had the party and everything) and it is mothers day   wow thats alot o stuff"
"kailey's team won 5-0, she had an assist, 3 shots on goal and 10 defensive stops!  not bad for a mid fielder "
"my team lost its match today but put up a much better performance than the last time we faced this team   the score today was 5-1 the first time it was 6-0 but should have been 12-0   they played nothing but defense the 2nd half of the 1st game, this time they had a fight on their hands   i'm very proud of the girls and how much they  have improved "
"kailey's team won on sunday 5-2 but the first 45 minutes of the game were aweful   they finally came to life and put them away   kailey scored once, way to go kid!"
"bad day for the miller clan, we had to put our 4 year old dog <propfirst> to sleep   he ate something toxic and had kidney failure   we have no neighbors, and all chemicals are accounted for, so we think he must have eaten a toxic plant   as one would imagine the wife and kids are not taking this well at all   "
"my team lost horribly to barberton on saturday, kailey's team won 6-0 on sunday sending them to the playoffs!"
"well it is the end of a very bad season for my team, they played their guts out but their record is 0-8   i'm sure it has a lot more to with my coaching than their ability!!!  they had fun and plenty of sympath ice cream! lol"
"after 4 years in my current position i finally won ci coordinator of the year (out of 23 factories)   while i would love to take all the credit i cannot   the good lord had quite a bit to do with it when he sent me the likes of yannick, <propmale> and qais, corporate help and a very strong plant staff and workers   the plant won this title more than i   (but my name is on the trophy baby!!)"
kailey's soccer team won the first round of playoffs 3-2 beating barberton (a team that beat us during the regular season 6-0) 
"kailey's lost to copley 6-1 in the finals, not bad for the first season in division ii!  the girls played very well and we are very proud of them "
"1st offici<propmale> day of vacation: solved the electric<propmale> problem with the mower, with some help from the in-laws, still having some issues with the carberator but it is <propmale> least running enough to mow   also got to watch some world cup action   not to shabby"
"vac day 2:  replaced a couple of door knobs and locks; watched some world cup action, was rootin' for nigeria but it wasn't to be, swam with the kids a bit and went to the drivin' range   now i'm off to watch a movie with the family   "
just heard the loudest thunderboom ever!  it even scared the dog!  my windows shook!
"day 5:  in the past 3 days i've fixed the lawnmower, cleaned out the garage, spread some mulch, added about 10 things to the to-do list, played w  the kids watched some world cup action and now we are going to the nature park in tallmadge!"
"evaluation time of year, always hectic and anxious   "
i haver a hard time believing the world cup the last 2 days   some crazy results   
went to the portage lakes fireworks display (the display was awesome) last night   i could not believe the number of hillbillies that were in attendance 
"played soccer for the first time this year, was put at goalie after 15 <propfemale> again   not becasue i'm any good <propfemale>d you but i suck alot less at it than anything else!  had a lot o' fun though"
"just got done playing soccer for 2 5 hrs   i'm soaked, stinky and half dead   there were only 5 of us (3 old guys and 2 kids)   lots of fun though   "
after almost 15 years at the massillon heinz plant i put my 2 week notice in on monday   i'll be the operations manager at a cheese factory in louisville ohio   not an easy decision but i gotta take a shot or stagnate where i am   i will miss it though   
"first game of the season, first at the u-11 field, first at division 1 and the results green 11- us 1   the kids played with heart though,  they'll get better"
"first day was a little surprising, spent 3 hrs for orientation, no biggie there, then spent the rest of the day meeting some people and time on the floor    it appears there is a huge opportunity in the discipline of running a line   a couple of the supervisors look encouraging   "
"started planting seeds about what needs done first:  basic training sports conditioning   its all about the fundamentals, what is your required output and how are you tracking against it every 30 <propfemale>   by the end of the week all my supers will hear it "
must   get    work   computer   working    must   get    work    computer    working     *zombie voice*
soccer update!:  well we knew this season was going to be rough and it is   real rough   our kids are playing hard but we are simply out matched by the skill of the others   if we were still division 2 we would be destroying the competition   i hope the kids understand this   
"soccer update:  we lost again to the best team in the league   we've played better but all in all the girls are getting their positions   defense stayed about 80% disciplined today (a good thing) but the 20% cost us   offense is another story, they need to focus on ball control    i'm still proud of them though"
thanks everyone for the birthday  wishes!
holy smokes the browns beat the bengals!
"soccer wrap-up:  well we didn't win a game but the girls have improved greatly throughout the season   we lost 6-0 to the #1 team today, which is a big improvement over the 11-1 loss on the first game   now its time to do the indoor thing and get ready for spring "
"wow, even i didn't e playful ect the browns to win today!  looks like we might have a team this year after all   "
"just recieved some terrible news   one of our u-11 soccer stars has cancer   no kid deserves this but it hurts a little more when it affects someone you know   good luck <propfemale>, i'll be praying for you kiddo!"
