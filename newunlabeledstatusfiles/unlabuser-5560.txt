"is concerned, my house guests left this morning at 10 already two bloody <propfirst>'s deep      it is now three and they are no where to be found, wonder how drunk they are and how obnoxious they will be when they get back"
now they have their mulligan     
"walk through the jungle to arco ballena, no bueno    thank god for hydrocortisone cream    "
so tired    
damn its humid       maybe that is why <propmale> refuses to sleep
thai night with the girls!  too bad i'll have the baby in tow
"is having a hard time saying no to moving to a house that is 45 minutes away from everything without a pool but with the most jaw dropping view i have ever seen        decisions, decisions"
waiting for my parents to get here and then heading to <propmale> <propfirst> for 5 days!
seriously the nicest place i have ever stayed     
ugh on vacation with a sick baby
"is venturing out of the condo today        looks like munchie is better but i feel worse, funny how that always works out    hopefully <propmale> <propfirst> is cool"
"he is finally sleeping, thank god!  esp after being up till 11pm last night, seriously what is wrong with my child"
"holy crap <propmale> <propfirst> is a totally different world, never e playful erienced a costa rica like this!   my dad said i live out in the middle of nowhere i guess he might be right---  i'm missing my quiet beaches with no one in sight---"
we are walking!!!!!!
people warned me how intense parent visits are when you live out of town but i seriously had no idea        5 days and counting
"can't go out to dinner one more night, i think i might die"
"is excited to come back to the land of good internet, target, and reliable produce at the grocery store"
"almost three months down here and i found a real crib, not a pack n play a real crib     <propmale> you will be sleeping well tonight my friend"
need your opinion: would you rather attend a first birthday party on a friday evening or a sunday afternoon?  (dinner or lunch basically)
"1 more day, 1 more day     "
is heading toward a mental breakdown      
"i officially live in costa rica, my car is broken        and we have to figure out how to get to san <propfirst> on monday (5 or so hours away)        gggrrr"
"going to look at a potential new house, pool and a yard, hard things to find around here!"
"is heading for a long drive to san <propfirst> tomorrow, hopefully the baby doesn't scream the whole way like he did here     "
"made it home in one piece!   all screwed up, can't believe it is still light outside"
"aawwww, its good to be home, i've missed my people "
is very cold    
is blonde again    
"signing the in-laws up for facebook, i think this might be officially lame"
"nice to be back, came home with a walking, babbling, raspberry blowing, kissing (his new trick) machine!"
is it normal for a one year old to fight sleep like crazy?   maybe he only needs one nap a day now?
"do you ever wonder who still plays the bagpipes????   my neighbor apparently  and it is really fucking loud, thanks for waking up the baby jerk        first clue that you shouldn't play bagpipes on your deck in a neighborhood where everyone leaves their w"
my child now flails his arms when he is excited and answers his toy telephone     
"going to look at another house, hope we won't be disappointed again     "
"new house! ya, pool and an outdoor shower      and the most amazing some grass!"
rain here smells like seattle      if that makes any sense
"first babysitter tomorrow am      not sure if i am going to leave the house, might just make a baby book (i'm so behind)"
"ninera (babysitter) just left, had to use the computer to translate     i need to get better at speaking spanish, that being said i understood more than i ever had      "
"no wonder munchie is hating life, he is cutting 4 teeth, 2 just poking through and the others underneath the gum   lesson to moms:  music soothes the savage beast"
"<propmale> was suppose to be home at around 4 it is now 6, pouring rain and getting dark, i'm worried   he has the car and the working phone----"
happy birthday to munchie!!!
"lost my husband again today, hmmm is this becoming a reoccurring theme?   apparently a softball game takes 5 hours, gotta love tico time, <propfemale> <propfemale>!"
"had the best thai food i've had in a long time last night, at my neighbors     "
after months of purposely keeping <propmale> away from our sketchy stairs he has learned to climb them and wants to learn to go down     in the process of trying to teach him he almost rolled down them twice today
"first full day of the weaning process, even though they say 2 years i just really can't imagine nursing a 2 year old in public      this is going to be interesting!"
sick husband and weaning teething baby makes for a very tired me!
feliz <propfemale> de la madre!
"now we have a sick me, sick <propmale>, and crazy baby         boo!"
"ugh, tired!!! baby just went down for a nap, going to lay down and watch trashy tv while trying to decide if i should still have the ninera come tonight    thinking not i don't want to get her sick too"
"officially coming back to the states dec 11th thru the 21st, who wants to go shopping with me?!?"
shit he can now reach stuff at the edge of the counter    
has been fighting the nap war       and loosing
"huge black wasps building hives all around my house, waiting for <propmale> to get home with <propfemale> spray and trying to e playful lainto the baby that outside is not good right now"
"baby slept in today! ya, got up at 5 smile 0"
anyone else's little guy still get the hiccups all the time at one?

"clean, clean, we have visitors coming!"
"apparently for some people it is an option to sleep on an atv, toilet, and stairs all in one night  costa is always full of interesting people"
"please god just let his teeth cut, i can't handle many more days like this"
yeah weird        sorry i'm not walking anywhere today woke up in the middle of the night with a pretty high fever and started puking    feel better today just really really tired
and the last thing i needed was to get the flu food poisoning     fun fun!
is the sinking feeling in my stomach a sign of bad things to come or just the extension of the stomach flu i'm recovering from       
"is still alive, i just don't have internet anymore"
not having internet sucks
so looks like that bad feeling in my stomach was true
"ok wow! didn't mean to freak everyone out, just feel like everything is falling apart       looks like we are going to have to move back home and there is literally an issue with everything"

sick baby  sad 
happy to see 3 sheets back    
not having a car sucks    
ahhh  back in my own house!   just wish it was located in a tropical place     
"aaaahhhhh cranky baby and angry husband, maybe a part time job won't work     "
"hahaha!!!! i found you asshole, you will pay i promise!!!   all my 'detective' work has finally paid off and i found the new residence of my shitty renter who owes me a ton of money!  i got to warn his new landlord too, maybe she will have a better <propmale> than we did "

"the zoo apparently isn't entertaining enough for my child, however the empty field in the zoo where there are no animals to see is where he wants to be     "
i now have short red hair      
"its official, <propmale>'s first accidental call to 911   thank god i heard someone on the other line or we would have had cops show up       guess i should stop letting him play with the house phone!"

"for my wonderful sister and everyone else i know         put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered baby loss  ??? the majority won't put it on, because unlike cancer, baby loss is a taboo  ??? break the silence  ??? in memory of all the ~angel~ babies gone too soon but never forgotten about"
does anyone else's child walk around having gibberish conversations with themselves?
thank you for all the birthday wishes everyone!
"now he can climb out of a pack n play, the crib has to be coming        i am envisioning a little visitor in our bedroom at sometime soon"
"officially survived the wedding show! all by myself this year, thank god that is over       and i already got a hit-  i'm back"
anybody know anyone who needs someone to watch nanny their kids part time?   ideally ok with them bringing their own kid         
"seriously, does anyone ever follow the facebook ads on the right?  like would it be worth it to advertise a&o there?"

"how bizarre, <propmale> is much more interested and willing to try to speak spanish     "
"wedding season has officially begun, first set of the save the dates went out this week, met with 5 new brides and have 8 more meetings scheduled in the next week and a half     busy, busy!"

"get to go do a bridal consultation, with no voice     this is going to be interesting"
"ugh, sick mommy sick baby     sucks"
the only thing worse than having a sick baby is knowing that you passed the sickness to them     hopefully he feels better tomorrow
"really?! really?!  <propmale> and i are finally starting to feel better and <propmale> is up all night puking        he doesn't know it yet but he will be quaranteened to our bedroom and the bonus room and i'm sleeping on the couch---  the last thing i need is a puking, coughing baby!"
"for bjorn nielson, <propfirst> bergesen, grandpa bernt, papa and my mom, who is still with us and fought a hell of a fight!  today is the international day for the fight against cancer    in memory of those who lost the battle against cancer, and those who continue fighting  i pray for a cure  92% of you won't copy & paste this tex   t to their facebook profile status, will you?"
"just as i am feeling better, i take a turn for the worse, will i ever get over this cold??????  i'm so tired of being sick"
"finally on the mend, but oops we got grammy sick       no more babysitter  sad "
"most frustrating part of my job is having a client want something ugly, being unable to talk them out of it, even after showing them how much better it could be, then having to sit and design this ugly thing     yuk "
"flush, flush, flush, <propmale> has apparently learned how to flush the toilet"
is today over yet?
can't focus     
"poor little guy, first ear infection"
blah
"baby with <propmale> this morning, so nice!"
its a sad sad day for this country  so much for governed for the people by the people---
"naptime marathon finally done, time to sit and work with a giant cup of tea, all i want to do is sleep!"
"how come i always get some song from toddler group stuck in my head? all i've heard all day is 'i roll the ball to 'insert name here', he rolls it back to me'"
ugh munchkin now has pink eye and the doc thinks he is starting to get a virus--- fun fun!
shit he now has the stomach flu----
"so i'm thinking not the stomach flu cause his 'issues' only lasted for an hour or so, but it appears i now have sore throat    ugh, another virus!"
"i am cranky and sick, with a child who is clearly not himself, and rather bi-polar  and i need to work, but i think sleep would be more beneficial to my mood---poor <propmale>!"
"i don't understand how it is taking my neighbors over a week to move out of a house that can't be any bigger than 1500sq ft     and there is still crap everywhere   i feel bad for the owners, i'm sure its going to be a total bitch to get the house ready for the next renters-"
is it possible my child is going through the 2 5 disequilibrium at almost 20 months? or is it just going to be waaayyy worse then?
"been awake maybe ten minutes or so, massive fit number one  and counting     "
most frustrating day ever!!!!
"leaving the to-do list for tomorrow, already been a really stressful week so i'm taking the night off, hope my clients will understand!"
"just shaved <propmale>'s head, and like i predicted he freaked out!!! but a lot easier than cutting it with scissors"
"please e playful lain to me how it is possible the one thing in place to save my family's quickly sinking ship is now totally and completely f'd up?----   its amazing how many crappy things keep happening, the gig is up, i think we are ready to cash in"
"fuck you citi morgage, you are a crappy company"
rad    the stomach flu
"i think we've made it through, everyone appears to be done puking--- hopefully that doesn't happen again for a long time"
"about 12 hours cleaning the new house today, finally home for good but now working on stuff for clients, still feeling a bit iffy     just want this week of my life over"
"it appears that all of the 'fingers don't go in the toilet'-s i have told <propmale> have finally sunk in, he now sticks his feet in"
exhausted 
"just gotta get through one more day, then off to vegas early tomorrow am        now only if the weather forcast would change, i need some heat!"
"laid down for a few seconds during danes nap to relieve my frustration from this fit-tacular day, woke up an hour and a half later     i'd say it worked!"
<propmale>'s new favorite 'lullaby': folsom prison blues
here we go again     
"ugh, getting sick"
need to remember that when you see the warnings signs in business and life it is best just to walk away--
"pretty sure i'm not the only one who got nothing accomplished today, judging by the fact i've gotten 0 new emails since 11 am"
calling it quits for the night early to sit and drink wine with <propmale>
i cannot take one more fit
"bad ear infection with a torn eardrum     <propmale> and <propfirst> are both out of town, was up at least every two hours last night-  awesome"
"i ? azithromycin--- munchie is much better today, thank god"
its not uh oh if you do something on purpose       good lord its only 1 and i could use a drink
i am now completely obsessed with finishing reading the lovely bones (a little late i know) and am convinced i should have forced my way through it while pregnant cause i think it is even harder as a parent    
"if you haven't noticed, i have not posted a link to my house, which means it has sold, today in fact      now onto the next problem, where to live?   i got 30 days to figure it out"
"couldn't really tell you why, but feeling a little defeated today"
i don't understand why it is taking my dryer three cycles to dry a load of clothes      nothing appears to be wrong and i have a mountain of laundry   sad 
"smart guides--- so useful, so annoying"
i have come to the realization that the old adage 'having it all' is a complete load of crap especially if you actually want to enjoy life
"came to the realization i have to move again in about a week and like ususal, nothing is packed or even remotely ready      the only thing that i'm taking solice in is that we don't own much from moving 6 times in two years"
"i am pretending that i did not just see my husband drive off with our son on his lap!!!!   know they are only going up the street but we aren't in costa anymore, that will be one crazy ticket!"
"if i'm lucky maybe five hours of sleep last night, followed by a day full of packing work and cranky toddler, can you guys who didn't sleep either?"
"3 days till we sign and move, 5 days till we close, can't come soon enough!"
"upstairs packing, listening to <propmale> and <propmale> sing songs about football   smile   cute very cute!"
"last night in our house, although i've moved out once before, i have to admit i'm just as sad     "
"unpacking, unpacking, unpacking!   will it ever end?"
yeah! my internet is back!
"anybody else's kid go nuts when they got their two year molars?  <propmale> is insanely tired and so full of energy at the same time, along with needy and clingy        can't wait for them just to come in"
"<propmale> managed to lock my mother in laws keys, purse, and glasses in her car--- that kid is trouble already!"
"it appears i have found the cure for mono: virigin coconut oil, astragulas, garlic, st <propfirst>'s wart, goldenseal, b-complex, apple cider vinegar, pre-natal, and kombucha"
"skydiving, shopping, dinner at aureole, live music at house of blues, good day in vegas!"
"back home and childless till tomorrow, don't know what to do with myself!"
"who would have thought with a husband who has mono, that i would get it        i'm hoping my herbal vitamin cocktail works wonders for me too"
"sleep, must sleep---"
"<propmale> is on the obx war path, i give us 2 months <propmale> in seattle--- heaven help me"
"edmonds was full of crazies today-- my personal fav:   overweight guy in his mid 60's with shoulder length <propmale> of white hair, long beard, wearing only (no shoes or shirt) women's dazy dukes that were at least 2 sizes too small and didn't have pockets on the ass--  i wish i had a camera"
"totally dreading the drive out to factoria today with the kiddo in morning traffic, just to drop off something to a client, i should have put my foot down"
not liking this weather    
boo! <propmale> woke up with a cold now we have to postpone his bday play group tomorrow---  even though he doesn't know the difference i'm feel bad
happy birthday little guy! can't believe you are two----
feeling big changes coming
"\the rolling hills and <propfemale> trees of <propfemale> wait for me    \"""""
going blonde!
"if you couldn't tell, i finally found our camera cord, almost a year later    "
braving rush hour traffic to <propmale> to meet my new nephew!!!
"its officially the week of babies,  who else will go into labor this week?  3 down    "
"seriously regretting the massage i had on saturday to relieve crazy tight muscles in my hip, the muscles are great but now i have a raging pinched nerve from all the pressure point releases, ugh i would rather have the tight muscles"
"what is better with a 2 year old--- leaving ridiculously early and flying all day \(2- 3 hour flights, with layover) or leaving around nap and flying till about midnight, then staying the night in a hotel?"
"flights booked, dreading oct 5th"
<propmale> is finally in his crib wearing my hasselbeck jersey over his pj's cuddling a football
"let the sorting, purging, and packing begin!"
"ever want to feel really stupid, enter the real world for 6 years and then take a gre practice test     "
nothing worse than a sick toddler    
"exhausted  2 5 days solid of high fever, no appetite, and restless sleep, this would be much easier if i was the one who was sick     "
"breathe in, breathe out          at least the fever is gone, hopefully his bad mood won't last forever"
"anybody know of someone who would be interested in 22 bum genius 3 0 one size?  (cloth diapers) trying to purge before the move and we don't use them anymore, they have been taken care of very well and were used for about 5 months      boyish colors"
"throw away, organize, pack, throw more away, every 6 months, the mystery is how do i keep ending up with so much stuff"
"i hate waiting on other people, drives me crazy!"
"phase one, done! out of our house staying with the inlaws, and <propmale> is in mt"
pretty sure i'm in over my head    
less than a week!
<propmale> made it out of west <propfemale> alive without any deliverance sort of episodes!   and is finally in the the obx----  i guess its really time for me to leave seattle    
"<propmale> is at dinner at a new friend's house in nc, its about 9pm there and surprisingly he hasn't gotten kicked out yet, must be a good sign    "
"first real quiz, wish me luck!"
waking up at 3:25 is unnatural   
"ahhh, ocean how i missed hearing you everyday!  made to nc in one piece, and if it wasn't for <propmale> being all messed up time wise it would be perfect!"
"aaaaahhhhhhhh, sun, watching the ocean from my deck, and dolphins!"
likes it on the table behind the couch
"got a lesson on what it means to be called <propfemale> in the south!  thanks for the great evening <propfemale>, we had a blast!"
i wonder if the baby monitor would make it out to the beach     
ahhh     running on the <propfemale> beach
can't believe i'm already getting christmas advertisement emails and thinking about christmas cards     
is it over yet? cause i'm totally over it     
"lives with a parrot      who likes to copy <propmale>, i need another girl around here to balance this all out!"
<propmale> is laying in bed playing the harmonica instead of sleeping    
"first official swear      shit     who's fault, ummm mine"
lives with a mini jekyll and hyde who seems to prefer hyde
black truck = blek fuck
"<propmale> was def right, black truck does equal butt fuck       oh boy, this is going to get interesting, he walked around for a good 5 <propfemale> tonight saying this is a butt fuck, while <propmale> and i couldn't control our laughter  i see this being embarrassing sometime in the future"
"went to a little historical farm today and the only thing <propmale> was more interested in besides the cow poop was the grave yard, not really sure what to make of it"
pretty sure a restaurant with a playground in the back that lets you eat or just take beers out there is the greatest invention ever--- thank you outer banks brew station!
frustrating morning        worst part is the most frustrating person is myself!
"<propmale> has his first official girlfriend, little <propfemale> all of 7 months old, the only child i have ever seen him be genuinely nice to, with kisses and all     i wish i had my camera"
pretty sure that if i met my online statistics professor we would hate each other
"<propmale> irons rest in peace, and peace to your pregnant wife too      so very weird, from the dengue where i have been you have to contract it mulitple times and be sick multiple times for it to be fatal, unusual to all the sudden get it and die without knowing, esp for someone so well traveled      "
"6 am spin class, jumping dolphins, and <propfemale> weather       november in obx"

"yay!   3 2 in the unnecesarily hard stats class i just finished, now if i end up back in school, i don't have to retake it!"
"11 smile 0 still in jammies, watching the snow storm and making cookies for <propfemale>"
"just finished traveling with pomegranates, not my fav, the first half i found kinda interesting, but then it just became too much      really your life gets mapped out for you in dreams?   would you like to extend that power to me? i could use it    "
"<propmale> and i have the never ending cold, this sucks"
"wishing <propmale> didn't puke when he hurt himself, now i have to figure out how to get the smell out of the couch      ugh!"
