"just got to fort knox, ky with <propfirst> and <propfemale> (3)   life is good!!!"
shall be off to north <propfemale> for a few days   patrick'a grandmother passed away from a stroke   sad times   
i'm going to fo check out a new dojo here in about an hour *crosses fingers*
"new dojo has been checked, i have some hope for it but starting anything new is intimidating   and it's in a different style   i'll take a few classes and see how it goes   "
i'm off to try a new dojo   i looked at it yesterday and it seemed to have promise   no bad vibes or anything   my only real concern is that it's a different style than what i have already learned   i hope that the students will be sociable and all   we'll see   i'll let those who wish to read this know how it went later   lol   love to all   
"not too sure about the new dojo, i guess i don't do too well at taking criticism but i'll take a couple more classes there and check out another place and see   weeee"
"i love to see new movies at the theater, but i guess you know that you're in a small town when you have to drive to a bigger one to see one of the new good movies   like district 9   damn small local movie places   "
soooooo glad it's friday   
"stressfull day over all   3 year old is acting her age   whew (day's almost over)   found another dojo though, this one i have a better feeling about and will take a class on tuesday, and he'll let me wear my belt, yay!!!"
"found a new dojo, this one feels really good, not as good as my old one, it's missing the same peoples, but otherwise i'm happy with it    yay!!!"
"i just earned three stitches in my chest from the dermatologist hole punching out a mole they didn't like   new sensation   good news, it didn't hurt at the time (numbing stuff)   bad news   the numbing stuff shoud wear off in about an hour  weee "
"other good news, they removed the other skin tag thingies that i've never liked from my neck, about ten or so   they too are still numb, they shouldn't feel too bad though   in theory "
"ugh, damn headaches   hope the new meds work   karate was fun tonight though "
"biopsy on skin thingies are back   they said that one was just a skin tag that commited suicide (as some are wont to do) and the other, while structurally odd is also fine on the cellular level (which is more important)   i had my stitches removed today and the wound looks like something out of a horror movie, they said it was fine but put me on some antibiotics anyways    oooook    love to all "
"off to see a neurologist tomorrow   lets hope he has a better answer than \it's stress\""  or \""are you sure you're not depressed\""  if i hear those suggestions one more time i am going to have a rarely seen coniption   no one wants to see that"""
"saw the doc today, he had some thoughts and is going to run some tests and see what he can find   here's hoping something comes back that is visable and fixable   i already know something is off   lol   and not just my sense of humor   lol"
"question???  i like doing some of the quizzes on here but in the last few days, more often than not, in trying to take me to the quiz it just keeps redirecting the <propfemale> and it won't load, even though another friend has taken it   is there something i should do about it or is it something on facebook?   any one know???   lol"
"sorry i haven't been here in a while, been on a trip and trying to take care of myself   feeling worse tonight, but more test have been done and more to come   weeee   love to all "
thanks to all who wished me well on my birthday   it was quite a good day   love to all 
i've learned that ground fighting is fun   weee 
"i'm going to back to college in <propfirst>  be a licensed practical nurse in about 2 years (at least that's the plan, lol)   yay for me"
"i could be wrong but i think if you have no power and the electrician find a couple of spoonfulls of water in you circuit breakers   that's a bad sign    thankfully it seems to be fixed and since we rent, we shouldn't have to pay fot it, in theory   "
"it sucks that the drummer of my favorite band (avenged sevenfold) died, i hope it wasn't drugs but i can't say i'd be surprised   that bust my bubble of joy for the day when i heard  (sigh)"
"i have officially signed up for college classes here and i start on monday   good god i'm nervous, lol   love to all "
"i love snow, really i do, but   come on   isn't this starting to get a little much?  we had about 6 inches last week and are going to get that much or more tonight and tomorrow, makes traveling difficult, lol   love to all "
"some people mistake understanding as agreeing with them, they don't always go together  makes things more difficult when the two can't be seperated by the person you're trying to understand   "
"god it sucks when you get good advice, you know it's good advice but you just   can't   seem   to use it when you need it most  makes life difficult some days, lol "
"just saw <propfemale> in wonderland, it was decent, not impressive but decent   keep in mind that the 3-d glasses are in no way made for 3 year olds, lol "
"someone e playful lain how i can possibly have more than about ten distinct emotions in one day, most of which had no trigger   guess my inner child found a switch board   love to all!"
"why does my heart try to overule my head, especially when we've had these discussions and we decided they were irrational and not true   hmmm   makes me feel like my own personal saboteur, lol  love to all!!!"
"this light at the end of my emotional tunnel doesn't feel like a train this time   we shall see, lol   love to all!!!"
sometimes the hard decisions are also the right ones   it helps to know the difference  smile 
"for those of you that believe that your intuition is a good thing to listen to and follow, why do you think you can feel apprehensive all day?  it feels like a guessing game with the divine most of the time   can't tell who, what when where or why but you know it's probably not something pleasant, and so you just get to wait, lol   i hate waiting   especially when it might be for nothing at all, grrr!"
"i got a new computer   yay for me, lol, first new one in almost 8 years!!! love to all!"
"hey i got and 86 in my anatomy class, not too bad,lol, considering most either fail or have to take it again the first time   i took it in the summer where it's an 8 week class instead of 16   think i'm a little proud, sometimes that's ok "
"should i be more mad at myself that i almost started a fire in my kitchen, or more proud that i stopped it right before the fire began?"
"life is good because i am loved and know how to love   and am better at letting other people have and keep their own problems without my pressure or interference, lol  love to all  smile "
"hey, after much nagging and procrastination, i have finally added more pics to my profile, enjoy, lol!!!!"
it has been decreed   today shall be a good day  anyone who doesn't comply shall be taken to <propmale> e cheese and lost in the ball pit  smile 
"thank you all very much for the birthday wishes  i got more wishes than i thought i would, lol  love to all!!!!"
"i start my cna class tomorrow  i'm quite nervous about though i know i shouldn't be   i only fail if i miss one class, lol, wish me luck!"
"some days i truly can't decipher how i feel   not even if it's good or bad, lol, makes me worry about my sanity at times but it's a fun ride in any case  smile    more often than not anyways   "
