it's hard to figure out in life sometimes the basics that we need when there's all this bulls**t in between   friends are family that we get to choose and choosing one friend over another isn't the best way to show how much one says they care   do they call that an oxymoron? saying one thing but doing another? or is that called hypocrisy?
