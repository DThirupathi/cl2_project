"broadband companies can now block you from visiting sites, stop you from using applications like skype, and force independent media makers to pay added tolls or risk not having their content delivered  they can thumb their noses at obama's plan to connect americans this decision takes control of the internet away from its users and hands it to companies like at&t, comcast and verizon  it's that bad "

"the book nook threw away a la-z-boy because the reclining lever broke a little; i carried it about five blocks to my apartment, and it is awesome  i am going to collect comfy chairs: couches and loveseats take two people to move, and they are so 20th century!  laugh "
"taking a break; book nook threw a decent wicker loveseat away too, so i've lugged it to my house  now i just have to get it upstairs to my apartment    "

"got an iphone ipod touch ipad? join me on imo, a free to play, zelda-style 2d mmorpg  i just started, but this is the best mmo i have found "
seikon no qwazer: so let me get this straight-the hero is an incarnation of god that drinks breastmilk (out of   the tap?) to power his alchemy? the japanese are seriously twisted 
it's all bullshit; all i can do is stay positive and hope that ups  will post the job listing soon 
i know i would make a great husband and father but i'm a terrible provider; i might as well have aids and leprosy for as undesirable as i feel 
i just about had to beat down a hoodrat; i should have called 911- damn woman is going to have to kill someone before she stops owi: hopefully it's not one of her kids  cool neighbors with fucked up relatives-it's always something
