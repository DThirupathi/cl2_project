"2009  an odd year  full of many new e playful eriences   i hope to <propfemale> the speed through to the next year, never backing off, searching for that limit on life's edge, without the full throttle drama i tend to get  2009 was a great year  now 2010 will be the best  as i type this i hear the new year thundering in  no wait, that's <propfirst>'s fireworks   "
"we would like to ask that when people pour out their soul into their statuses, frequently and so intensely, that you hid it in obscure references, seemingly irrelevant lyrics from a relevant song, metaphors that only the person you are trying to reach gets, or otherwise encrypting your messages for your rep and sanity of others  thank you to all to whom this may apply "
any one know where i can by a whole pineapple for really cheap?
"that's why they call them \fish\""!"""

"have you ever got a horrible feeling so strong that something bad was going to happen that when it comes, you arent even affected by it?"
"in the past weeks i have decided that all this seriousness and drama is a waste of time for the young  we are meant for fun pursuits in  the belief that if there is a one they will come at god's will, so we should keep our search wide and carefree as is ever possible and not look too close "
"? somebody's gonna hurt somebody before the night through ? ?somebody's gonna come undone, there's nothin' we can do! ? ? everybody wants to touch some one, if it takes all night  ? ? everybody wants to take a little <propmale>, make it come out right   "
"and on that bombshell, its time to end!"

"i shall continue to do nothing   nothing is best  this is not giving up  contrarily, this is what i call a win  i am happiest when i do nothing and i will continue to do nothing, that is, until someone else gives me a reason to do something  but 3 strikes your out so    nothing it is!"
awkwardness is a human creation  people make things awkward  we make our own awkwardness   it's stemmed from a combination of cowardice and laziness  it reflects one's self confidence when one feels awkward everytime a situation arrives  its hilarious though
haha

wtf <propmale>!?
is talkin like a damn fool  too much time on my hands  and really ticks a way at my sanity
who cares what people think? lol 
i admit  i blow things up for my own enjoyment  its kinda a bad habit really
hahahaha duh!
everybody blows up things with little meaning into something huge  then everybody is freaking out over nothing  and when you sit back you can see that a little curious chat and a little concern about feelings ultimately turns into a soap opera  nobody likes soap operas  that's why theyre daytime tv  go with the flow  it's nothing  honestly 
my mom registered me for the sat the day of the remarkable run  i never get to go

"? i wait in this place, where the <propfemale> dows   run   from themselves    ?"
i will attempt once again to run for an hour and will likely stop in 30 minutes random reason again  boy i'm outa shape   
a black pontiac with a dent behind the driver's side door keeps following me   
"wierd night, weirder morning  dodged a bullet  transmission shot"
"lmao, he doesnt see his hypocrisy and it feels much like revenge  still no phone  bye"
"? now if you're feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been paying ? future's coming much too slow ? and you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin' ? can't decide on which way to go yeah, yeah, yeah"
yes i can totally identify with indecision  peace of mind sounds like a plan
