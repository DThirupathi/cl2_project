"we'll just see how this goes  i'd much rather just stay where i'm at, really  lj links may or may not be coming soon "
"only good thing that happened about today: dr  naasz's dancing  amusing yet pissed off worthy thing that happened about today: mother's angry at all her kids because of our child output not matching hers  okay, so you're mad that we don't fuck like a pig in heat like you do, mother? hahaha, the lulz "
"dance, dance  here we go again, <propfemale>, there goes the white rabbit "

"ah, day of silence, great aspect, bridges  full of sweet and interesting people  well  the ones that i talked to  feel free to add me, don't be scared  stalk me, cook me, eat me, bury remains "
