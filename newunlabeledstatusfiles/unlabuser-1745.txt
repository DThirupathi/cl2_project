"is tired of waking up so early or going to sleep extremely late  he needs to work on his sleep schedule  instead of being on facebook right now, he should probably be working on one of his papers that are due soon but     naw!!!! those shits will get done eventually"
thinks his sister is trying to suffocate him  it feels good to be back home though 
"thinks his sister is trying to suffocate him  it feels good to be back home though  and he's starting off grad school the same way he finished his last semester of undergrad, with a 4 0 "

doesn't know where to go from here 
"feels a little bit like shit right now, but talking to his sister a bit made him feel a little better  last thursday was clearly a mistake, though  classes start on wednesday "
"thinks this semester is going to be a bad one  it's already starting off bad  he's pissed for one thing: the guy at the barber shop last week trimmed his beard too thin, so now he has to shave it and start all over  and he has to take all 4 classes with everyone else in the program, no extra hour break  its not like he was doing anything with that hour but it was still nice to have  this is going to be some bullshit "
is starting off the semester with the babyface (no hair on top & no hair on the face)  we'll see how long he keeps that up

has a feeling that he's going to get sick very soon 
"has had a rough day  he hit the ground more than a couple times, almost pulled a hamstring, got hit square in the eye with someone's shoulder, got somebody's blood on his shirt, and almost popped his shoulder out of the socket (and that shit still hurts)  all this and no fouls got called (on him or anyone else)   "
is trying to get his passport as soon as possible so he can be able to make a business trip to canada in march 
is trying to get his passport as soon as possible so he can be able to make a business trip to canada in march  and why was like half of the club (males & females) trying to fight at a damn auburn aka party tonight? that shit was pretty funny to see though 
"just got back from the game  he e playful ected kentucky to beat the shit out of auburn; instead, uk only won by 5  it was actually a pretty good game to be at; he's glad he decided to go "
"would be pissed off if he was a cowboys fan  but he's not, so he's just watching the game laughing at their misfortunes & their pathetic kicker "
"thinks he knows way too many people born in january  so (if you've known him these past few years, you already know what's coming), fuck all of you capricorn & aquarius people! where the cancers at?     in unrelated news, he thinks the uconn women's team is easily going to win the title & everyone else is playing for 2nd place "
"is looking forward to having a nice little spring break this year  a jay-z concert & sixers @ hawks  and if he's lucky, add lakers @ heat & the sec women's basketball championship to that "
is a little mad but not surprised at how bad unc sucks this year  those duke matchups are gonna be a bitch though 
"is bored as shit today, with nothing to do & no one to talk to  maybe he should start apartment searching around the philadelphia new jersey delaware area online (wouldn't want to do that at the last minute) "
would really like to know why pau gasol can't make a fucking free throw 
is a little surprised that tuskegee's basketball team is actually good this year 
"is predicting a vikings-jets, vikings-colts, saints-jets, or saints-colts super bowl xliv matchup in 2 weeks  one of these has to be correct     unless everyone on these teams were to perish in some unfortunate accident  but even then, they'd probably just use practice squad players for the game "
"thinks the jets were beaten by a superior opponent  and the vikings' offense played like scared pussies for a good bit (6 fumbles) and the saints still needed overtime to win  keep in mind the only reason the game went to ot is because favre threw an idiotic interception when he should have run with the damn ball at the end of the 4th  if today is any indication of what's to come, the colts will win super bowl xliv "
tiene mierda que debe ser completado para el miÃ©rcoles  se espera que la Ãºltima frase es correcta

"would like to do something that would make his hair stop growing  he's tired of having to shave his head every week  that shit gets old after a while, but he doesn't want to walk around looking like a dark <propfirst> <propmale> all the time either "
has just 1 question     how the fuck does burger <propmale> run out of burgers?! only in tuskegee fucking alabama

can't wait for this test on friday to come and go 
"had a dream the other night where he almost got shot by someone with an ak-47, but the cops came in before the guy got to pull the trigger  he has no clue what the hell that's supposed to mean  he's beginning to think he might be losing his mind "
"would like for a saints win today, but still thinks the colts will take it  he really doesn't care who wins in the end though  he just wants to see a good game "
"usually doesn't see any goals scored or fights in hockey games because they normally happen when he changes the channel  but within 5 minutes of turning on the devils-flyers game, he saw a goal scored by new jersey and a fight soon after  today has been great!"
loves his days off during the week  he gets so much extra sleep on these days 
feels like he could really understand what's going on in his sonar class if he was being taught this shit correctly 
told those folks at paine that tuskegee would spank that ass at their homecoming and that's exactly what happened  he has a quick message for rhodesha middlebrook too: don't forget about the little bet you made with him; he e playful ects to be paid in full 
is patiently waiting for spring break to arrive 
"is thinking of some bullshit to put on his status, but nothing is coming to mind "

"is looking forward to having a quick week  the faster this week goes by, the faster this saturday will come  jay-z & young jeezy live from philips arena "
"doesn't feel like washing clothes any time soon  so, instead, he's going to buy enough underwear & socks to last until after spring break and wash in about 2 weeks     don't judge him    "
"would like for several aspects of his life to be a little different, but he's not sure if it's possible to change them "
"was starting to like the weather here in auburn     until monday, that is  this shit's starting to get a little chilly again  it's time to bring the beard back (the process started about a week ago) "
"saw something in his apartment complex earlier today that looked exactly like a rat, but was literally the size of a big ass rabbit  what the fuck was that?"
"is finally done with midterms  now, it's about time to drink all the pain away    "
needs to start e playful anding his blu-ray collection 
"has found himself listening to a lot of wale, chrisette <propfemale>, kid cudi & linkin park lately     such a strange combination of artists    "
finally got his passport  toronto is only a few weeks away 
"just saw an article on yahoo! that listed the top 10 highest earning mid-career undergrad degrees  electrical engineering came in 4th with $102,000     looks like he picked a pretty damn good <propmale>  (and finishing a master's degree this summer won't hurt either)"
"feels pretty damn good when he says this: tuskegee university <propfemale> tigers, 2010 siac men's basketball champions!!!! 1 game left this weekend "
wants to congratulate <propfemale> bullock for winning the razzie for worst actress in 'all about <propmale>' & the <propfirst> for best actress in 'the blind side'  she's the standard for greatness and shittiness  what a feat to accomplish 
is about ready for the 2nd half of this punk ass semester 
"finally got his \boom dizzle\"" beard back """
is about to sit back and bullshit this entire weekend 
just got back from toronto & the very 1st sports news he hears is that the eagles has agreed to trade <propmale> mcnabb to the redskins     what the fuck?! this is a very sad day in sports  it's going to be a little tough to decide who to cheer for when the teams play at <propmale> financial next year 
"is mad  first it was the yankees, now its the duke blue devils  what the hell is the world coming to?"
"just saw uconn win their 78th straight game (their 1st win by single digits; shot horrible from the free throw line)  only one question comes to his mind: what if <propfemale> moore decided to go to tennessee instead?     in related news, why is it that women's college basketball games can get airtime on espn but the wnba is still stuck on espn2 status? it's almost like going pro in the women's game is a step down "
had a discussion with a few of his friends recently  they came to the conclusion that ewane may have been a mistake  it's pretty funny to come to that possibility to him (and them) 
"thinks the lakers need to quit bullshitting and go clinch the west asap  and he thinks espn should loosen the grip on tiger's nuts  all he did was cheat on his wife & play in the masters (in the fine city of <propfemale>, ga)  do they really need to broadcast his tee time all over sportscenter? it's not like he's coming back from the dead or some shit like that; now that would be an amazing comeback "
wonders if he is the only one that daydreams while in class or while driving on the highway  he missed an exit doing that recently 
thinks that this year will be the year that the cavaliers win the nba title (although he hopes he'll be wrong about that)  playoffs start in a few days 
"feels like a tortured genius     or maybe he's going a little crazy     or maybe he's just overthinking shit  whatever it is, there is something in his head that just isn't right "
"happy birthday, <propfirst> jones  rip "
"has too much shit to do  he has three tests, 2 papers, one presentation, 3 mini-lab reports, and 2 final exams coming up in the next 2 weeks (and he just had another test this past friday)  it's time to get on the grind  but that will be a difficult task since the nba playoffs are just getting started  (let's go lakers! clap-clap-clapclapclap)"
just saw a 12 5 oz box of corn pops at wal-mart costs $2 92 and a 17 2 oz of the exact same cereal costs $2 94     what the fuck?
"is on skype     he hasn't talked to the person that got him to sign up for that shit in over a month & most of his friends on there are the same motherfuckers he sees in class every day (no offense to anyone of them, they should e playful ect me to say some dumb shit like that anyway)     what a fucking waste of time to sign up for it  anyone on it not in tuskegee?"
just saw <propmale> tebow get drafted in the 1st round  shocking    
"had one random ass thought earlier  if a transsexual commits a crime & goes to jail, would it go to a jail of the gender it was born as or the one it switched to (he would e playful ected it to get raped a lot if it goes to the one it was born as)  anyways, happy 9th birthday to his little brother <propmale> "
is going to try to not use any foul language in class tomorrow (april 26) since it is the last day of the semester  an extremely difficult task indeed 
has to begin getting ready for moving to philly in august  the process has already started     by getting all of beanie sigel's albums 
would like to know who the fuck thought the double down sandwich at kfc was a good idea 
"just found out how dumb kentucky's basketball team was this past year  a team gpa of 2 025, the lowest among uk sports and the lowest in basketball since 2002     how stupid do you have to be as a group to get so low? it's as if they didn't even attempt to try to give a shit (which he's pretty sure they didn't) "
"is thinking about getting season tickets for the 76ers and or the eagles next year  if he can, he will "
"finally got his grades back for the spring  he got another 4 0  now, his grad school gpa is     still a 4 0  one semester left for perfection "
"a k a  mr  4 0 (just came up with that, how do you like it?) hasn't shaved in almost 3 months (and counting)  does it show? oh yeah, he got some tattoos earlier this week "
is on his way back to the great state of ga  congrats to all of the 2010 tuskegee university graduates 
"is wondering if <propfirst> woodson's eyebrows will ever fully grow back     looks like the hawks are about to get slaughtered again tonight  oh well, at least the lakers are still alive  let's hope both matchups end tonight "
"just noticed its been 5 years since he graduated high school  5 years can be a long time or a short time, depending on how you look at it  so many people he hasn't seen in a long time; one friend he'll never hear from again  shout out to the class of 2005, especially the one at a r  <propmale>  rip jbj "
"thinks it's a shame how the cavs just completely gave up in the final 2 minutes  have some fucking pride!!!! anyways, he hopes boston gets back to the finals so they can lose to the lakers "
"thinks it's a shame how the cavs just completely gave up in the final 2 minutes  have some fucking pride!!!! anyways, he hopes boston gets back to the finals so they can lose to the lakers  oh, basketball probably just died in ohio tonight  bye bye, lebron  see you in new york or chicago "
"just read a funny ass  fucked up rumor  he just read that delonte west has been fucking lebron <propfirst>' mom and he has been for some time  and it seems that lebron found all this out just before game 4  if it's true, then it sucks to be lbj  either way, it's still funny to e "
"is tired of seeing that fucking zoosk commercial on espn  conference finals start tomorrow night (at least the one that matters does)  bad start for the wnba, the sparks lost by 1  damn     and bad start for <propfirst> jones, played 3 mins and got a grand total of     1 foul (0 fga, 0 fta, 0 reb, 0 ast, 0 blk, 0 stl, but 0 turnovers!!!!) "
would like to know why there are so many us marshals riding around <propfemale> today 
liked how unc and duke worked together last night to help <propmale> lose in the clutch  <propmale> (unc) choked at the free throw line & redick (duke) made an idiot move by not calling the timeout 
"saw a strange billboard today  it was billboard for paine college  it looked o-so lame     um, pc is cool and all (he guesses), but they don't have shit on tuskegee university     but he's just saying    "
hears voices in his head 
thinks the magic might have already lost game 3     and it's still 7 minutes left in the 2nd quarter! a damn shame 
"would normally offer his friends that are fans of fallen teams to come support the lakers  but with the way the magic just got completely slaughtered tonight, he fears that those people might bring some bad luck to l a  holy shit they got their ass beat!!!! better luck next year, arnecia <propmale> & ehi igberaese "
has to wait until the end of july to be cured of the disease called school  he hopes it comes pretty fast 
thinks <propmale> got lucky tonight  they tried so hard to give the game away  let's hope for la to go up 3-1 tomorrow 
"is having some trouble keeping up with the days of the week  he just found out today is wednesday, but it feels like a thursday     damn those lakers; they better win game 5 "
just got some pretty good news  things are looking like he might be able to get to $1 million before he turns 40  cool shit 
feels fucking great  <propmale> artest finally did something right!!!! the w at the buzzer; the lakers are 1 win away from a 3rd consecutive nba finals appearance!!!! fuck yea!!!!
"said it after game 3 & is saying it again tonight: better luck next year magic fans  starting thursday, the lakers will show you (hopefully) how to kick the celtics' asses "
"got the finals matchup he wanted, lakers v  celtics  rampage pretty much got his ass beat tonight  and how does one break his leg while celebrating a walk off grand slam? ask kendry morales of the angels; it happened to him today  tragic  tragic!"
is going on 4 months since he last touched his beard; it's starting to get a little thick  (how do you like the 'kangol' product placement? 'kangol' all day everyday!)
is ready for game 1 of the nba finals  he also needs to start a fund to get to the all <propfemale> game in los <propfemale> next year or the year after in <propmale>  anyone want to make any donations?
liked the way the celtics played tonight; they lost by 13  title #16 is 3 wins away    
just turned to espn & saw that the spelling <propfemale> is on  some of those kids have terrible teeth; it might be best if they just don't smile  he's just being honest; that shit was horrifying 
is wonder why the hell next friday & barbershop are coming on oxygen tonight 
is wide awake right now and it's almost 3 in the fucking morning (central time)  he's thinking that he shouldn't have taken that damn 3+ hour nap earlier  the sleep was awesome but he's paying for that shit now 
"doesn't know what to say about tonight's game  <propfirst> <propfirst> <propfirst> has 27 pts, 9 14 fg (7 8 on 3's- tying a finals record for 3's made in a game) and it's only fucking halftime     yet, as amazing as walt is playing, <propfemale> & kg are playing shitty & the lakers are only down 6     crazy 1st half "
thinks the referees in the first 2 games of the finals have completely sucked  how the hell do the celtics & lakers shoot a combined 134 free throws in only 2 games? there's no fucking way that many fouls are being made  terrible result to game 2 by the way 
"thinks game 3 was great! thank you, <propmale> fisher! 2 w's away to #16 "
"thinks game 3 was great! thank you, <propmale> fisher (11 pts in the 4th) & <propfirst> <propfirst> (0-13 fg, 0-8 3pt)! 2 w's away to #16"
just saw <propfemale> pierce punch a ref  funny shit!
"told himself that he would never buy a snuggie  then a couple months back, he saw there was one made for the lakers  time passed and the lakers made the finals again and     well     you see the results    "
"almost had a <propmale> to save a little money  but after a series of unfortunate events, he's back in the hole  but at least he was able to fix part of his car & possibly get an apartment in the philadelphia area "
blah blah blah fuck shit very bored 
didn't realize <propmale> perkins meant that much to the celtics' success  oh well  he's wondering what's going to happen in game 7 
"is sleepy as fuck, but can't go to sleep because it'll just mess up his sleep schedule     and why the hell did an ice cream truck just ride past his window as he's typing this? who the fuck called them?"
is calling it a game now  boston just won; you can't win a game when you're shooting 25%  la didn't show up 
just saw a crazy game  this is one time he is happy to be wrong! 16 time nba champion la lakers!!!!
"thinks this is a bad year to be a boston sports fan  the lakers win back-to-back titles (the 2nd was against the celtics); the red sox get swept in the 1st round of the playoffs & the yankees won the world series; the patriots get their asses kicked at home in the wild card playoffs; and the bruins lose a playoff series after being up 3-0 (and had home ice advantage)  damn  how does if feel, <propmale> camara?"
is on his way to atlanta  birthday bash 15 tonight at philips!
took a nap earlier today  terrible decision that was 
"just saw a crazy match at wimbledon between <propfirst> isner (usa) & <propmale> mahut (fra)  this is the score: 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 59-59     what the fuck  and the shit still isn't over; it got stopped for today because of darkness (just like yesterday) "
needs a change 
spent a hell of a lot more money than he initially planned on this weekend 
has a new address in pennsylvania 
is so ready to get the fuck away from everyone around  it's almost like july 31th can't come fast enough 
"has about 2 weeks left of classes before he can be finished with his master's degree program  after that, it might be time for a doctorate (the only reason to go through that is so all of you will be forced to call him 'dr  etinge') "
"didn't think lebron had the balls to shit on the entire state of ohio, but he did it and is joining the miami heat  early prediction: lakers over heat in the 2011 nba finals "
had a nice time out with his friends tonight for his birthday  it sucks that absolutely none of them are going to be in philadelphia with him though 
"has a question: if a person orders a pizza for delivery, pays with a credit card over the phone, and the delivery guy gets into an accident on the way, does the customer get his her money back?"
is finally done with school  5 years at tuskegee university getting a bachelor's degree & a master's degree and it's finally over    
"was driving to <propfemale> earlier today when he saw a brown car with a black dodge neon trunk  to make matters worse, the car was a plymouth  if any of you know this person, tell him or her ewane said \kill ya self\"" """

just got back from citizens bank park  the phillies straight got their asses kicked tonight  but there is good news: he managed to beat the traffic on i-95     why the fuck is nbatv always showing that fucking shake-weight commercial?!
