"â€œno one is born hating another person for the color of their skin, religion, or background   hatred and intolerance have to be learned   even in the grimmest times, i have seen glimmers of humanity which reassured me that manâ€™s goodness is a flame that can never be extinguished â€�    --<propmale> mandela\\vive <propmale> diffÃ©rences!"
"goin' to the drag show tonight with all my home girls!!  can't wait to see all my talented friends perform -- i love you all!  you put the rainbow sprinkles on top of my cupcakes, baby!"
