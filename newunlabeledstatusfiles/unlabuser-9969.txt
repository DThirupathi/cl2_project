the absolute person you wuld dream to be and mabye become is exactly a waste of yrself cus thas kinda the point of bein you ever-part of you will be the worste part of the future replicant of you-make life   and teach them to be everything no one you knew was-if thas not love     then nothin matters
love is metaphysicaly speakin a phenominum that drives us to uncharacteristically create a better self that will dudge us and choose the other insane descicioin that we dare not  but its def better than wat we chose t do initially   cus we only did so much   tell me yr self in yr dreams isnt exactly yr deviant clone  fearless and understands more than they are
