ppl say they want the truth yet they can't handle it  ppl say they're tired of lies yet they welcome them with open arms  make up ya minds

question fa the guys: if you an a girl fell off completely an stopped talkin why would it matter if she was talkin to another dude?
temperature's risin' an your body's yearnin    for me-r  <propfirst>
"i know things happen for a reason, it would just be nice to know why sometimes"
love is an emotion that blinds us from the simple and obvious truth
"like lil <propmale> said \i'm single\"""""
somebody once asked me why i do the things i do and i responded because i choose to  isn't that what life is about:the choices we make and how they affect us
"after everything i've been through, ain't no other way to be but real"
sometimes you gotta go through hell to get to heaven
it's remarkable how similar the path of love is to the path of insanity  so does that mean that love makes us insane?
love is the one poison nobody warns us about
some things just aren't meant to be understood
sometimes you have to cut ppl out of your life that you never thought you would have to

"reality check: last time i checked i was not yo child and you are kindly mistaken if you think imma let you talk to me like you done lost ya d*mn mind  dont get it twisted, you have been dismissed  some ppl need to learn the meanin of respect"
real loss is only possible when you love something more than yourself
"being grown is a mindset  just because you're older than me doesn't mean you're grown  you act as a child therefore i consider you to be one  approach me when you grow up, i don't have time for games or childish demeanors"
"i can only be me  so dont ask me to try to pretend to be somethin im not  accept me for who i am or move around, period point blank  any questions?"
"you only get one <propmale> at life, so make it count"
i hate it when ppl tell me their homeboy wanna talk to me  last time i checked ya homeboy had 2 legs and a mouth to approach me and tell me himself
they say things arent always what they seem  sometimes i wish things were exactly as the seemed
you'll never leave where you are until you decide where you'd rather be  *thinks* decision made

to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance
to fall in love with yourself is the first act of happiness
"romantic love is mental illness  but it's a pleasurable one  it's a drug  it distorts reality, and that's the point of it  it would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really *saw*"
