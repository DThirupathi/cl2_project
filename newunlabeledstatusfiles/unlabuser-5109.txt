"it has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy and you will always love them  re-post    if you have at least 1 of these friends "
