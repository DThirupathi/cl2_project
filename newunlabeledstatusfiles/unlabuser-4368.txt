being perplexed and mentally overwhelmed 
"i just finished designing pythonreticulatus com  it is now in stable release  any feedback on the site would be appreciated  if you find bugs and glitches, drop me an email and let me know where you encountered the bug and i will fix it "
sitting here coding and playing with my nile monitors  next pet to play with    my female african rock python 
looking for some new clients 
"just another early morning  its 3:18 a m , do you know where everyones at?\   on a side note, when you type your news feed message in the top search bar for facebook, does that mean you should go to bed?"
"hey you! yes, you looking at the screen! debrew that who! i'm away from my computer  i just got home  my computer was signed in all day  i will be back though!"

"feeling indecision, uncertainty, and detachment "
"not much, just sitting here playing with my phone"
just another day in chaos

"so doberman # 1, referred to as kane gets his first bite on another person  credit can go to <propfemale> for being the unknowing helper in getting kane to make his first bite on a person  she got too close to kane while he was protecting his prey item and he turned around and snapped her  now i will hear about it for sometime "
high strung 
sitting in the office wondering why i have to be the one who doesn't need sleep  its a pain when you're the only person still up 
sitting at the most wonderful place on earth: dmv
9 more <propfirst> to go at dmv
"well dmv didn't take long  with as many weirdos as there are at dmv, i can see why dmv employees would be miserable and unhappy "
waiting to do poli sci homework 
"adrial, an 11 5ft lavender albino reticulated python coiled up resting in the cabinet "
sitting in a financial accounting lecture working on asset depreciation methods
