"knowledge is a valuable thing  in voicing a thought we define a series of ideas, stringing them together in a structure we call language  it allows for the communication of thought  such an ability is a powerful one  it allows one to place their thoughts in the minds of others, allowing knowledge to spread, treasure to be stored in the minds of others, seeds planted in fertile ground to grow in their own unique ways "
"in essence of the value of knowledge and the power of language to convey it, one can recognize the far greater magnitude of significance we have in the power of writing  even any seemingly unimportant or common mundane knowledge or trivia is valuable  simple journals and letters from even a hundred years ago give us insight into the life and culture of what was then society; it gives us insight into another world "
