may there  always be work for your hands to do; may your purse always hold a  coin or two; may the sun always shine on your windowpane; may  a rainbow be certain to follow each rain;may the hand of a  friend always be near you; may god fill your heart with gladness to  cheer  you and may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows  you're dead
