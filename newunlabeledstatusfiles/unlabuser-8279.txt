"when i was walking home, i thought i heard someone calling me  the voice sounded familair, i guess it was just the wind "
it hurts just being in the same room  is it bad that it feels like this?
a broken heart is like glass  its better not to try to fix it than hurting yourself more  and its hard to find the peices that broke beond repair 
"hmmm what should i do? should i try? it might end up being a mistake in the end, but me being alive still is a mistake    "
"people always deny the things they want the most in life  its a common fact, its just we can't face the truth about it  we can get hurt because of that   "
"halloween is a day full of demons, vampires and many more  its the only day i can be myself    i have a goodie full of surprizes  hopefuly it will last   "

"its funny how when you are hurting the most, people ignores you and won't even look at you, it just makes things hurt even more   "
"pretend that we never knew each other, forget each others name and just walk away  turn around and head in different directions, like we never knew each other  just walk away, never look back    "
"o o holy shit    i just seen a shooting <propfemale>    thats my 3rd one now     wow, i never made a wish before    "

"let all hell loose, with me being a solider and killing people with the snap of his fingers  a deadly wepon, with demons in my soul, doesn't who you are, how close you are to me you'll still be a target "
"fuck you asshole  if you don't know why we are even together then tell it to my fucking face, not over a text "

"ask me any question you want to know about me, i will anwser truthfuly"
"for everyone that is slowly breaking apart, there is someone in the background wishing they can be there to help you get through it   "
"lock all the doors, turn off all the lights, blast the music, feel it go all around the darkness, get lost in the night  love "
i am still half asleep    ugh!
the wind going across the dead earth feels peaceful but its so sad to see the earth dead    heart-broken

"l-am lasat mintea mea merge, iar acum l-am pierdut    "
"turn around and head in different directions,\like we never, it's like we never knew each other at all \we said what we feel, then we stop ourselves,\and just walk away \never looking back,\loving every second of it,\we just walk away "

"am i too bad to go to heaven or am i too nice to go to hell? even in death i bet i can't truely belong anywhere    whatever, its something i always seem to have known even if i didn't want to admit it   "
little by little    i am realizing that i have more reasons to die than to live   
"things that seem the most real, \are things that when they break its ment to kill  \love is a wanted time, \but after its done, what can only be felt has to be a crime  \''i'm ok'' are words that are said so light, \they dissapear into the night  \it's a mistake, for even believing that this was real  \roses are red, voliets are blue, nobody knows how much that i still love you "
i was love drunk but now i'm hungover  laugh

"watching movies, i got nothing better to do   "
"things should try to be forgotten, feeling that would make people turn rotten  forget the lies, the name, the way you felt or you will be haunted by the past, they will follow no matter how fast "

"i've been thinkin about the way i want people to die under my hands    its pretty gnarly and gory stuff so far    criminal minds, you give me awsome naughty ideas haha    "
"i got way too many thoughts in my head, and i swear i keep hearing my phone go off    the only one who keeps me sane don't have his phone   the one who makes me feel normal, is offline    the guy who makes me smile, had to go to sleep    the guy who i want to be near, is  at ''wtf, where r u''"

"a simple gift is gave out of love just to a smile   \its something that i wanted to see because of me for its been awhile   \then catching me by surprize you offered up a hug  \i loved that the most, but theres something that buged   \is the way that my heart went, thud  \thats when i'm sure that the scar you left, opened and down went the sad blood   "
"smile to avoid unwanted truth    cry only when your alone    love as if its your last    when you need someone the most, everyone decides to leave   "

"it's hiding in the dark\it's teeth are razor sharp\there's no escape for me\it wants my soul,\it wants my heart\no one can hear me scream\maybe it's just a dream\or maybe it's inside of me\stop this monster!"
i love the rain  even if i'm stuck walking in it  smile 
"i really want to know if i try, i would make it    well, it wouldn't to try    so i'm going to try   "
i don't want to sleep    he's going to be in my dreams    the dreams of him goes into nightmares   
i got to sleep    finally
