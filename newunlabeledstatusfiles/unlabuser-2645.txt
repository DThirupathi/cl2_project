i've started to accept the fact that probably my next twenty years will mainly involve kid stuff   now don't get me wrong i like cartoons i probably always will but i'm starting to dream about preschool songs and shows   also as an adult i realize i don't like half the characters on the preschool shows that are new and the ones i liked as a little kid myself
