so today was a lovely day but my back hurts when i do the inhale exhale thing    which seems to be necessary so maybe the pain could go away    i'm also stressing about a few things   
so i was taking a walk and stubbled across a little big tree  (i named him <propmale>) he's pretty  has dark green fluff close to the trunk and light green tips  very close to my cactus 'steve' in hawaii 
rq: don't be someone elses slogan because ur poetry

"rq: you were like my lover and my best friend  all wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it    don't even recognize the ways you hit me, do you?    you'll do anything for the one you love  'cause anytime that you needed me, i'd be there  it's like you were my favorite drug  the only problem is that you was using me  in a different way than i was using you   "
enjoying a glass of arbor mist   oooohh so classy
