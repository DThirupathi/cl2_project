"therapy is e playful ensive, poppin' bubble wrap is cheap!  playful "
laters
i hate playing the waiting game 
just plead the fifth -- or drink it -- either way 
happy new year!!!!
such a hottie!!!!
going to my first dr  appointment today   so excited!  laugh 
"well, it's official   i'm 13 weeks pregnant  smile "
gonna try to go back to school   wish me luck
"so, tomorrow is my second dr  appointment   hope it goes better than the first one   also gonna apply for school   digital media design  laugh  much more my thing than drafting turned out to be "
the appointment went well yesterday   got to hear the heartbeat  smile  also have most of my applications filled out for school and took a tour of my department   so excited!  had to get both the flu shots yesterday so today i've been feeling icky though 
in need of a good outlet   something like a journal but one that i can get feedback and suggestions   like a blog but anonymous   any suggestions?
way too early and missing my coffee
been a long boring day   should be busy with stuff around the house but i'd rather be doing something else
"pix, pix, whose got some pix? *giggle*  looking for any of my friends who have pix of us hanging out, being crazy, doing what we do or whatever else ya might have and want to share "
was surprised to wake up this morning with my guy cleaning house  surprise  it's not even my birthday or anything lol
so many unanswered questions running through my head   wish i could just turn my brain off for a while
finally starting to feel a little more like myself again   forgot how much pregnancy screws with your emotions
"whatever u give a woman, she will make it  greater  give her sperm, she will give u a baby  give her a house, she  will give u a home  give her groceries, she will give u a meal  give her  a smile, she will give u her heart  she multiplies & enlarges what  she is given  so if you give her crap, be ready to receive a ton of shit   wink  real women keep this going  ?"
passed the tests today  smile 
so not ready for this week to start
today went pretty well although i had to change one class due to schedule issues   so far the work load sounds okay so i'm feeling a little less overwhelmed about adding more changes   this one actually seems to be a positive one that's helping to offset some of the negative ones 
nothing annoys me more than when an instructor doesn't e playful lain what they e playful ect
so sleepy     zzzzzzzzzz
luv that the kids are old enough to start helping around the house now   makes life so much easier
just had my ultrasound and it's a boy!!!!
"i admit, i'm a handful!!! unfortunately \most women won't repost this  i'm strong willed, independent, and \outspoken  i make mistakes, i am out of control and at times hard to \handle  but if you can't handle me at my worst then you certainly don't \deserve me at my best  if you're a handful then post this on your status"
getting to bed before midnight  laugh  amazing
really wishing i had a car right now
"why does the answer \nothing\"" bother me so much grrrrr"""
"true\ friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question\ their friendship  these types of friends pick up like they just \spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how faraway \they live    repost \if\"" you are lucky enough to have at least one      \",c5f41386c071096c36851b46ab192a5c,"anyone can be a father    it takes someone special to be a daddy   happy\ father's day!!!"
feeling so down lately   i have 101 things to do and can't get motivated to finish a single one of them   or maybe it's just to overwhelmed to know where to start 
"why is it that every time you start to see the silver lining, clouds have to roll in and it starts to rain?"
had my 2nd ultrasound today   caught him sucking his thumb and stretching this time  smile 
can't wait for this semester to be over with  my work load is killing me and at least next semester the only person i'll have to count on with classes is me   don't know why but it seems like the majority of texans are complete a**holes   this of course does not apply to any of my friends   you guys are awesome and hopefully you know that 
?? i'm off to see the wizard   ??
what a long day  glad to finally be home and relaxing 
just got back from the water park   the girls had a blast 
needing a break from a few things   wish i could just hop in my car and drive for a few hours with the music blaring
actually got some things accomplished today   feels good to finally not have so much to worry about
have my appt in <propfirst> today   hope everything turns out to be fine   in the regular ultrasounds he seems healthy and active and he's very active every day so i have high hopes 
"got back fro <propfirst> a few hours ago and everything is fine   i really need a new doctors office   this one reminded me of how a real one works, unlike waco health care "
kids can be so cruel  love feeling wanted   sad 
so sleepy
my animation clip is finally complete and came out so cool   working on uploading into youtube now   so excited 
"grrr    what an annoying day already   walked to class today only to find no class   i've got so much work to do and so little time to do   this class has already been the biggest pain in the butt between going through 2 groups who don't want to do any work and having to do everything myself, then having so many dr  appts at the same time   working my butt off for a class i'm probably going to fail anyway "
"been a long rough day for everyone today   must be something in the air   to all my friends going through a rough patch, just remember it can't rain forever   {{{hugs}}}"
"taking a very short break b4 i do this paper for tonight's class   been a pretty good day, still have a pile of work to do by monday but slowly and surely it's getting done   could really use a long back rub   braxton hicks are a real pain "
not feeling great today   hoping a long shower helps
out of class yay! time to get my 5 drawings finished up   saving everything else for another day   luv deadlines   not  smile 
well it's been a busy day   had my baby shower (the first and only one i'll have) and it was awesome   tiggy is the most amazing friend a girl could ask for  laugh 
grrrrrr!!!
i feel like i haven't slept in days   getting too uncomfortable to sleep and the heartburn is a b*tch 
"i feel lazy but so much better   been asleep for the past 3 1 2 hours   and i got some good news this afternoon    if we can come up with the money, the house is ours  laugh "
i love my bear!  let me sleep in this morning while he got the girls ready and sent off to church   sleep has been so hard lately so it was nice to get a <propmale> to get a little extra
tonight's turning into one of those sleepless nights  sad   wish i could just stop thinking for a while   stop worrying and feeling so helpless about a past i can never change 
finally finished with all my classes   now i just have to wait to see what grades i end up with 
just got back from school shopping and getting some stuff for when the baby arrives   damn i'm tired
"at\ the age of 4: mom knows everything  at 8, mom knows alot  at 12, \momreally doesnt know everything  at 14, mom doesnt know anything  at \16, mom doesnt exist  at 18, mom is old fashioned  at 25, maybe mom does\ know about this  at 35, before we decide, lets ask mom  at 45, i wonder\    what mom thinks about this? at 75,    i    wish i could ask mom \about this    post if u have the best mom in the world"
i feel accomplished already this morning   got my appointment changed to the day and time i was hoping   not that big of an accomplishment normally but with this dr  office it's amazing when anything goes the way it should   never been to one that was this bad before and i've moved enough to have e playful erienced all types of service   if this weren't my third child i'd be scared sh*tless about having this baby   no joke
had fun with tiggy painting the belly last night   pix to come  laugh 
pix are posted  smile   time for me to take a little nap but i'll be back later so leave some comments 
homework with the kids then dishes whoohoo
finally got my math program to load properly   these distance learning classes will go just fine if i can ever stop fighting with my computer 
last night we had to take my daughter to the er over a bump on the head   she was fine but since it happened at the skating rink it was a precaution they suggested we take   i had been working on my first assignment in math b4 we left and wasn't able to finish it until late   exactly 42min late     got a 70 when it would have been a 90 grrrrr 
felt awful yesterday and ended up sleeping most of the day away   so far feeling at lot better so hopefully i'll be able to get some things accomplished 
getting sick sucks and the timing isn't so great either   was supposed to be out of town for the weekend having fun with friends and instead we're all stuck at the house
