"o k  so it's more of a strawberry blond than a natural blond, but that's how it turned out    need to spruce up the pic though, maybe put on some makeup and wipe that cheesy smile off my face   but it was so funny i kept trying to pull my hair forward so i could get a good pic, and it made me laugh"

"i went to bed sad last night because love isn't at all what i e playful ected it to be   no sparks fly when we look at each other across the room, and we don't stay locked in long embraces and gaze lovingly into one anothers eyes, but for the last 14 years we've managed to stay friends through the worst of betrayals to one another "
"for 14 years we've put up with each others shit      when we fight i know i'll wake up in the morning to find him still snoring on the couch   at some point during the day i'll disagree with him about something, and at some point during the same day i'll laugh at his tacky off-color joke "
"we'll belly bump in the hallway and we'll laugh about our kids   on sunday we'll get up and go to church even though we both get lazy as hell   we'll work on the same goal even if we do it in a different way   he'll be there to f*ck with me when my bottom lip sticks out cause i'm crying at some stupid movie, and tell me that the baby gets it from me "
"all these years i spent looking for love, and i think i've finally got a clue   it's waking up and knowing that my life was lonely when he wasn't there for me and thank god he's been decent enough to forgive me and thank god i've been decent enough to forgive him, or it would still be a mess "
lol     that's what's on my mind this morning!
"if your dad is your hero, whether you are blessed to have your dad still with you, or if he is an angel in heaven looking over you, copy and paste this into your status and let everyone know you are proud of your dad ?!!about an hour ago Â· comment Â·likeunlike \write a comment   "
