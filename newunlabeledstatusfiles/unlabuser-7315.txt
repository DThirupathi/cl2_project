mad that i could've been driving my car  o well  now to get some work done to it 
"its funny how ppl use the 4 letter l word, any yet it really doesn't have much meaning anymore       "
is like hmmm         maybe the single life is really meant for him  maybe he is suppose i be alone in life  maybe he should just focus on doing him and not worry bout anyone else          
why have a heart when ppl just take advantage of it?
"is trying to force himself to believe that everything is going ok, but knows that in reality everything isn't  if pretending was just so much easier to make believable to everybody else, he would be ok  if ppl actually listened and understood what i am going threw instead of pretending like they cared, maybe my life wouldn't be so bad  just really shows me who is there for me and who actually cares about me      "
"is like turning my back on everything and everybody is just so easy and simple for me to do, but its not going to solve anything, just make things worst  like my grandma use to me, where there's a will, theres a way  just have to <propfemale> in there and keep believing     "
bout to take my ass to bed  only way to escape reality at the moment that i can think of right now  hmmm    guess i will fall back in place with reality and the people that make it so difficult later      
"hmmm    does it matter wats on my mind? does it matter if i open up and tell you how i truly feel about you? would you care if i turned my back and walked out on you now? is wat i say to you important to you at all? hm    didn't think so, all just lies that i made myself believe      "
"bored, listening to my favorite song    kinda odd that the song is having me ask myself a question on how i feel      "
"is like    everyone says that i can do better than the person i am with or that i deserve better than the person i have    which is true, i aint gonna lie, because i can do better, and i do deserve better, but    why do better if i am content with what i have?"
