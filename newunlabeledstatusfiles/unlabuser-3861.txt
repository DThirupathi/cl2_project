i am affraid that i might loose the one person that is helping me the most! i am trying to make sure that doesnt happen!!
he is the one that makes me happy; he supports me and cares 4 me; he doesnt put me down or judge me 4 my past; i will be forever greatfull for meeting him and for him coming into my life when he did!!

"instead of telling someone who rides a motorcycle how dangerous it is    why don't you look twice before switching lanes, making right turns, or pulling out of a driveway and sidestreets    stay on your side of the road, especially in corners    don't follow too closely    keep your eyes on the road and off your cell phones    and don't race up to intersections as i approach   if you care about someone who rides a motorcycle, please re-post   i hope to see all of my friends re-post"
