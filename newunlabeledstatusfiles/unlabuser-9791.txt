put this as your status if you know someone arerelated to someone who suffers from being a pittsburgh steelers fan  being a steelers fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously  there is still no known cure for psf and sympathy does not help  but we can raise awareness  90%    of steelers fans wont repost this   because they don't know how to copyand paste
"lmao to all the steelers fans, thats what happens when you look over the super bowl champs  just cause they lost to the browns doesn't mean they will roll over for the wack ass steelers "

"\i reject the challenge cause he is no challenge! but i will be more then happy to beat up on him some more  always said he was nothing    \"""""
