meh i'm here aren't i?
i'm in a very peaceful mode today  i've had a great weekend and life continues on   
"there, i have added a photo, lol  it's a bit out of date because my hair is a more-on-the-side-of-red-brown, but at least the weight is right! i've officially lost 56lbs since giving birth last july  for those that haven't seen me, that was all the weight i gained during pregnancy and then about 20lbs more "
"if you look at the link i posted all of my photos are a year old  the newest being the long lost family  since those photos i have dropped 56lbs  i'm very proud of myself because that was a lot of hard work  for those of you that have had kids, you know what i'm saying  i will try and get new photos on here soon  i may post new baby photos too!!! you guys rock!"
omg i hate tuesdays    *yawns* so sleepy     it's too hot here!!!
why are tuesdays so slow?! yippee i'm leave for the rest of the week!
you ever feel like time moves slowly to intentionally force you to acknowledge the world around you? like you have to just stop and realize that you're alive and that each moment you waste is lost forever therefore you must <propfemale> each that follow?
must go get midget     syl!
"i'm off for the week!!! yey! finally a break, lol"
i'm chilling here on the internet wonderin what all you happy people are up to on a thursday night 
i just got done working out for 3 hours and man am i going to be sore tomorrow    possibly today
i somehow insanely managed the energy to go for another hr long walk
"yey, another monday morning    "
i'm feeling awesome and i hope you guys are too! this is the best monday ever!
up late tonight    brody has pneumonia     i had to take him to the doc with a 103 3 temp 
"brody is feeling better today  thanks guys for your support  i didn't go to bed until 1 last night  not so tired but just worried about my brody bear  today i'm feeling good and i hope you all are too! <propfemale>, i love you girly!!! you'd better call me or i'ma tell mom you's ignoring me!  playful  tell mom i want to do a vtc this weekend so she can see the midget "
fable 3 needs to come out now!!!!!
"i'm a total geek and i'm damn proud of it! you don't like it    well, then poop on you  i play video gams and watch scary movies and i am totally addicted to neopets!"
"question of the day: do you believe that women can rule the world without holding grudges or being vindictive and spiteful towards one another? (heated debate at work for some reason, lol) i don't think it's possible  any thoughts?  joyful "
"rushed brody to the hospital today with a 104 3 temp  they drugged him up and said his test results were better today than yesterday  they don't know what caused the fever to resist the motrin  he is home in good condition, resting  i'm staying with him tomorrow to keep him away from other kids at day care so he doesn't spread the germs  he will return to day care thursday  let's hope tomorrow is less eventful   smile "
"omg, i haven't really slept in 3 days and right now i feel (and probably look) like afriggin zombie     this tape library is going to be the death of me!!!!"
question of the day: why is it that if someone tells you that there are 1 billion stars in the universe you will believe them  but if they tell you a wall has wet paint you will have to touch it to be sure?
slowly working on getting photos both old and new uploaded
"question of the day: if it's true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the others here for? just wondering    lol"
happy friday the 13th everybody!!!!!
"rubberbands of doom! colberg, you sing the sound of music one more time    *deep growly voice* i will find you!!!!!"
"question of the day: if you could go anywhere is the world, where would it be? why?"
"*shakes a fist* all a-holes  who run red lights on purpose should be punched!! or karmically punished, as wishing pain on someone would bring that back to me     damn road mongers     you all annoy me! *twitch* why am i still in florida with all these damn tourists and rednecks????! *_*"
question of the day: what do other drivers in your area do that makes you angriest? me? when idiots run the red light once the other light has already turned green because they are stupid or not paying attention  a few months ago someone almost t-boned me and my son on my way to base and the light had been green for us for about 15 secs and the idiot had to swerve around me to keep from hitting me 
mmmmm popcorn    100 calories of crunchy goodness   
strained my hamstring during my run today    i have to test next week so lets hope that it gets better
i am at peace with the world around me    i can't believe how good i feel right now  all i did was meditate for 20 minutes and i just feel great 
peacefulness has gone away! now i am just antsy for ssgt results! there is the slight possibilty we might find out the afternoon 
omg i don't think i've been this nervous and anxious in a long time! they need to release the promotion list nooooowwww!!!!! *twitches*
"well, i didn't make it but damn was i close  i missed promotion by 1 08pts  i was the no  3 nonselectee for my career field  whoot! i know you're like 'why is she cheering?' i at least know that i did well! i scored pretty high on my pdg"
i'm staying positive and feeling much better   smile

why is it that doctors try to scare the crap out of you when you're pregnant regardless if you've had a baby before? *annoyed*

"i have just learned that i am apparently only 5wks preggers, lol  that's twice now i've been tagged at 4wks with a pos preg test  doc says it's all good "
i would like to send many positive thoughts and energy to all my friends! thank you for being you! happy friday whoot!!!!

"is scared and looking for comfort  have any of you (talking to anyone who reads this) had to give prednisolone (steroids) to their little ones? brody might have asthma, but the doctor isn't sure  he's had a persistent respiratory infection that just won't go away  i gave him the meds without reading the sheet they gave me that e playful lains the side effects and now i'm terrified "
"brody made it through day 1 with no issues  hubby and i just got back from an ob appt  ultrasound was <propfemale> insanely clear, we saw full face  the most adorable chubby little cheeks you have ever seen and he definitely has his big brother's pouty lips  i don't know if the world can handle two absolutely adorable stevens boys  <propmale> is gonna be <propfemale>o cute  i can't wait to see him "
i hope everyone is having a great day   smile 
"take care of the ones you love, because you never know how long you'll have them  may the higher powers watch over my family throughout this and the next couple of days as my <propfemale> finds her way on the journey through life, death, and the beyond    to my family: i love you all very much, and i'm saddened i can't be there with you through this crucial time  give her a kiss for me "
"rest in blissful peace, <propfemale>  we will all miss you  i'm sorry i didn't have more time with you  give daddy a hug for me when you see him "
just a few more weeks and lil baby <propmale> will grace us with his presence  brody finally figured out my gigantic belly is not for punching but for a gentle <propfirst> and rub to say 'hi' to his lil brother   smile  i definitely will not miss being pregnant  i just look forward to the next step in being a mom 
anybody else feel like facebook is trying to take over the world?
"could use a little humor right now so: you and i wake up in a psychiatric <propmale> together  using only 4 words, what would you say to me? note; if you comment, copy and paste this as your status "

"i seriously want to punch morons who post stupid and rude crap in response to insightful messages because they think they're funny  if you can't say something in a respectful manner towards someone, even if you oppose, then don't freaking say anything at all "

3 days with 3 hrs of sleep a night and i'm dyin'     i miss caffiene!!!!
"why do we even have web based health assessments in the military? if i have a problem, usually i go to the doctor, don't most people? so why would i want to be asked a bunch of personal questions by an impersonal program? freaking thing told me i'm fat and lazy because i'm gigantically pregnant and am too far along to exercise a whole bunch  assholes    "

mmm <propfemale> gummies  smile 
"i wish that if someone had a problem with you, they would be able to come out and say it rather than run and hide from the situation, we are, after all, adults   at the same time, i give up on trying to deal with high school bs because i've moved on  you can only try to help someone so much before they have to figure it out for themselves   "
some peoples' children

"i'm contemplating getting another tattoo at the end of the year  i want to get get a butterfly with the celtic pentagram worked into the design right in between my shoulder blades, below my current tattoo   "
"i need to go into labor soon, lol  all is well in my hectic little world but i'm going to go crazy if i don't get to see my baby boy for 3 more weeks    "
i think i've decided that i'm going back to a soft strawberry blonde to match brody's color and this year i'm not going to cut my hair  just reset my bangs with the thick chunky cut
