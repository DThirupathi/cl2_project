"sittin in my living room, in the dark, wondering why things happen the way that they do  some people believe that everything happens for a reason and i used to think to but i started to question that when i loss my dad  was there really a reason for his early departure from life? i still needed him   i think now so more than ever   "
is goin thru alot of things right now  so much on the brain that it feels like itz going to e playful lode  y do i keep having these constant thoughts?? i dont wanna feellike this but the fact still remains that i do  so many people around me and yet i've never felt more alone  so many people to talk to but not one person willing to listen  i find it funny at times and sad at others  itz weird how life plays out isn't it??
"for those out there that know me, and i mean really know me   as a person  u know that im usually a happy person but something has stricken my life and made me feel like giving up  all i ask is that u pray for me cuz my prayers alone jus dont seem to be enough "
