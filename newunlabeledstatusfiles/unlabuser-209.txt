will start coming online on fridays saturdays   can't leave drawing board until project finished 
   my mind went blank for a moment there   
i'm wondering   where did common sense go? when did it decide to abandon us to a world filled with utter stupidity?
one more month  really got to keep moving 
i officially hate religion and politics now  as far as i'm concerned the age of reason is a bloodied hoax  leave me to see in shades of grey 'cause there's no reason for me to see in black and white 
there's the heritage fest happening today   best day to get away from the drawing board joyful 
working on website   about to go home and back to drawing up the rest of those pages   
a smooth guy tried to catch me off guard   thank god for the <propfemale> and common sense to deal with him  now its' back to the drawing board 
5 hours of sleep and i'm still kicking it 
got back from <propmale> mart and international festival   boy are my feet hurting   ;^^;
"its' so frigid   love it when it rains, but the wind is too much "
this weather is playing havoc on my senses! i'm praying that the sun will pop up tomorrow^^;
3 hours of sleep and i'm still up   what's going on here? maybe it was the late night rain that did it 
"i feel like a kid again   i'm studying <propmale> jones and looney toons for the hell of it  reminds me of how cartoons used to be done   and how life was before losing one's innocence  reality is harsh, but its' not enough to destroy the curiosity of a child, something i'm glad to still have some of "
blah   currently brain dead 
finally a <propfemale> november day! took long enough!
"do you ever have the feeling that a door opened, but you don't know where to find it?"
life is a doozy   knowing how harsh it can be makes you even more thankful you have a place you can come back to 
"bloodied hell   why can't i get some peace! cold, wet days like this is causing me untold havoc  it still can't keep me away from a pencil and sketchbook "
"i'm counting down the days  i know its' a little early, but need more time to get a new year resolution ready "
"three more hours til the new year   i got my resolution ready, what about the rest of you? here's hoping that everyone enjoy these last hours of 2010!"
"decided to kick back and watch some anime   trigun,dbz,and tekkaman blade is on the list for today  while at it draw some more smile   any one out there watched really good anime worth watching? looking for recent, out of the box mentality type   can't have too much action you know?"
its' getting ready to snow up here   about time smile 
stupidity reigns as people lose friendships over money   i hate it 
"its' raining its' pouring, who the hell is snoring? going back indoors and not too soon smile "
"writing, drawing and more drawing all the while having ff xiii ost blasting in the background   its' sweet getting back into the zone "
"this town finally knows how to rebound from snow smile  no use staying inside, just got to go go go!"
"preparing for next month   first convention, first time in the artist alley "
"i'm moving through a haze of emotion at the moment, but it'll dissipate soon  time to let go and move on "
"going to stay up til 6 in the morning and get some drawing in while listening to some jet set radio   at least that's the plan smile  for now, i'm going to chill at the library and get some comic pages done   "
"got a lot to do, so got to go, go, go!"
"didn't sleep til 7 in the morn   i'm still up and kicking, and still thinking of what to do until my body decides to kick it "
"my netbook wire is fried   my music is gone and so are my game references   oh well, i'm still with a mp3 player and got some old mags laying around  gotta improvise til next week   which is also the weekend of the con   this coulda been lame, but i'm finding some good in it "
"nervous like hell   three days, 7 hrs and i'm starting to really feel the heat "
"tomorrow, nashicon awaits   i feel i'm ready after using yesterday to work on and finish my first mini comic smile  got some more to do, but i'm glad i'll have a little more time before going onto the battlefield^^;"
in columbia now laugh  time to see where the road goes from here 
"man, back in spartanburg but really really want to leave again   got a <propmale> case of wanderlust that only moving will cure  you know you been in one place too long when everytime you think about returning \home\"" you say damn instead yay   """
"finished with blueblinda one,  launching it from the presses in two weeks smile  also back to working on il destino cremisi   crimson kismet(in other words: strands of fate)  going to try(try is the key word)to get it ready for the xeric <propmale> later this year(took too long to figure everything out) "
"wind feels good, going through life like this here breeze   these are the kind of days to be thankful for   that and confronting people who thought you didn't have a clue  sigh   glad to be alive and kicking smile "
"you know when you catch a person in a lie? they go blank and shut the fuck up for once   until they think they can pull it off on another person  at that point i just think: if they end up in the er, oh well   i don't give a damn  life is easier dealing with one asshole at a time   "
"tch   the closer it gets to may, the more anxious i get   "
"spring fling's going on, but all i want to do is draw  got too much to do to stop now (even though this is a small break playful )   "
i'm lacking sleep  need to count sheep 
"gah!!!! to the people who claim they're real: spare me  there's no use to announce it if others know you are or aren't  oh and don't bother with that \she's hatin'\"" shit   here's a point-blank fuck you for wanting to escape the truth annoyed ""real\"" is overrated in a world full of copies   where everyone is labled and or stereotyped> playful """
"ladies and gentlemen, here's the new product you're asking for: tunnel vision! look in awe as everything thing around you is focused on you and only you! play ignorant to the chaos that all are born into! say that 'oh i'm living' only to be blind to the reality that you are 'dying'! purchase one today! only costs one eye and your soul laugh "
"i'm not crazy about the mundane   when life gets too mundane, then something's not happening  that's why its' good to have a few nuts loose laugh "
thanks for the b-day words smile  hearing them makes life brighter laugh  lots of love to you guys and gals!
i'm back online to try and finish a website while drawing concept pieces at the same time   multitasking helps sometimes^^;
there is necessity for some chaos   point in case: linux ubuntu decides to die on my comp resulting in the lost of old writings   but gives me reason to start anew and makes me thankful for having my artwork on windows^^; god is good smile 
taking life by the balls and then tossing it over a goalpost   its' all good  its' sweet knowing you're close to accomplishing a <propmale> goal laugh 
"so tired,tired of waiting, tired of waiting for youuuuu    laugh  i'm just in the zone right now, getting ready for what else comes my way   i'm patient   yep^^;"
"living here is good, but it gives us limited perspective on what's going on in the world  that's sad,considering that its' us who are being left behind "
"got published in gold digger's swimsuit issue smile  thought it was going to be in the end of summer one, but got a surprise in my mail today    laugh "
in greenville right now  just finished getting a little business done and now waiting to go back   got the feeling that i won't return in a long time 
"i live on the border of obscurity, just peering into the tides that keeps me from living a deadend reality  sometimes its' better to be anonymous than to be known   i mean what good is it to have everyone say they know you, and yet not acknowledge your true self?"
i'm on an all-nighter   two pages to post tomorrow and two requests to finish  at least this keeps me on my toes smile 
gah   stratch yesterday's post   looks like it'll be either monday or tuesday^^; don't you just love it when all your activities revolve around what you enjoy? its' good to have the energy to just do what you really love(even after finishing everything you hate) 
two more months   time's running out(thank god   ) 
this is my last post for a good while  i decided to focus my energies on tying up some loose ends  i got more to say but i'll be better off staying tactful  all of you stay frosty 
i'm done no more posting what's happening on my side of the world  i'll send messages to those i want to share this walk with instead  sayonara smile 
there's always a little truth behind every lie   it takes alot to reach it though^^;
"when it comes to emotions, homo sapiens can be so masochistic   "
"a <propmale> shift is coming and sometimes i wonder if i'll be able to keep my head above the surface  all i can do is wait and see, instead of panicking only to drown "
"a great sayonara, aidos, ciao and goodbye to sc! may i get close to the flame and not get burned   "
to go further is worth the price of admission   its' better than wasting time on that which will never change   
frustrated  that's all i'm feeling right now    so losing what <propfemale> i do have considering its' getting colder up here!
what does it mean to be human? everyone has a different idea   
"i'm introverted and proud of it! it doesn't mean i'm shy, it means leave me to my thinking and i'll get back to you smile "
"i'm proud that i have natural hair  i know who i am, and i don't have to live a lie every time i look in the mirror  now that's something i'm thankful for!"
why does this feel like <propfemale> vu? do you have those moments of familiarity when it feels like remembering a dream?
"to all a happy thankgiving smile  keep safe, be happy, and don't do anything stupid(but only if you can help it) or let anything happen to ruin this day "
"flurries and bone chilling cold   that's what i get for trying to live in ny  not enough to damper my spirits   in fact its' more than enough to laugh  \movie on the list to watch tonight: sanjuro smile  sanjuro's theme in yojimbo is stuck in my head^^;"
"well, after this post i'm staying offline so that pages sketches can be done  can't be working on the tablet every day   besides its' a rainy day  don't want to be soaked and my imagination is working at its peak   better time than any   "
<propfemale> christmas everyone smile  enjoy the last few hours of this day to the fullest!
i'm ready to get out of the house for a bit  too depressed and frustrated to stay in considering the christmas i had  outside stress is no joke especially after this big blizzard that hit sunday  so here go hoping that the crisp air help clear my head up a bit 
i'm waiting for a new tablet stylus now   need to invest in a intuos one of these days  there's no worries especially when i got a mechanical pencil and nib ink to play with smile 
"got the friggin' flu   hate it when i get sick! to add to that, its about to snow again   this is a bad joke "
"anyone know of a good movie to see? i'm been thinking of tron legacy, but i know there has to be something of substance worth watching(i'm an action junkie, but i'm not willing to toss some caso out the window on some shiny crap) "
"decided to just go see tangled   i'm not as crazy for disney movies like i used to be, but its' directed by pixar's <propfirst> lasseter (meaning a <propmale> of it being good)^^;even though i liked the original tron, its' just that i'm getting loads of action watching yuyu hakusho   next up is to find ronin warriors   "
"more snow   argh!!!! as long as it doesn't prevent me from going to learn to make minicomics, i'm all good  thank god for free workshops   "
been watching a mess of movies anime as of late   i'm attached to blood: the last vampire and returned to one of my faves: the fifth element  mobius' design on this movie is superb laugh
