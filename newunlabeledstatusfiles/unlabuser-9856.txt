happy new year fb friends and family!!  hope 2010 is a great one for you!
up doing housework now so that i can play later!
i forgot how much energy a 2 year old takes and how busy they can be!!
going to bed     the kids start school tomorrow   can't decide if i'm happy or sad   they will do great - it's mom that has a hard time!
i am soooooooooooooo happy that i do not have to work tomorrow!  can i stress enough how thrilled i am to be off tomorrow?!  sooooooooooo happy!!!
took a bike ride with the kids this evening and is very glad that i lived through it!  thought we better have a little fun since i have to work this weekend   <propmale> is a slave driver!
"is about to go out and watch the kids play in the street!   smile   we have no sidewalks so the kids have to scoot, skateboard, and ride bikes in the street   luckily there are 20+ kids on this street so everybody watches out for them!"
at work having lunch wishing i were at home with the family!  i have the best husband!!!
i am home now and still have the greatest husband!
"appts, appts, appts today!  hope i can make it through all of these!  one is a daycare for the little one - can't imagine it can compare to the caregiver we had in portland!  <propfirst> was wonderful!!!!!"
the house is quiet - kind of scary        makes me wonder what everyone is doing!
home from work and ready to relax!  <propmale> loves me the best tonight - woo hoo!!!
"very thankful that it is friday!!! long week, need the weekend!"
"trying to get motivated     have 10 million things i would like to do today, but the body is just not wanting to move!"
going out with old friends!  just adults - wooo hooo!!!
enjoying my family!  it's been a really nice day!
3 of 4 home sick today! wish i was there to take care of them!
kids are better now we have to play catch up with homework!  <propmale> starts in home daycare tomorrow morning wonder how that is going to work out?
"finishing up a 12 hr shift   get to go home, sleep, and do it all over again tomorrow!  makes me thankful for the weekend yippee!!"
about to have hot water again!  cold showers are no fun at all!
at work  knowing that it will get busy and trying to get prepared for the rush!
very glad to be home  this makes me want to hibernate for the night with the kids!  feels like a movie night coming on!
love seeing everyone's life!  you are such an awesome group!
going to sleep   that's sad considering its saturday night 
supervisor called me off for the weekend!  can't get much better than that!  woo hoo!!!
housework today so we can play tomorrow   seems like a fair trade to me!
finishing up last minute chores (actually just giving the kids chores to irritate them he he he!!) and hoping that the weather breaks so we can go to rib fest to eat good food and hear some great music!!
"at work, hour 4 5 of 12, am i going to make it?!"
if something in your life doesn't work - change it!  author unknown
part of the healthcare reform should be mandatory nap time for all employees!  we would be so much healthier if we had a nap after lunch!
home with the fam! back to the real world and being a grown up again  sad   this was a fun weekend too bad it had to end!
"oooo <propmale> just texted me and asked if we are having date night thursday!!!  he must still like me a little even after almost 12 years, 4 kids, and a million poopy diapers! lol!"
"date with hubby was nice, but now we are back at home and all hell has broken loose!!! knew it was too good of an idea to be true!!!!!!!!!"
"this week was bad at work so i am devoting this weekend to forgetting it and moving on  busy, busy all weekend!!  yippee!!"
just got back from meeting old friends at southeastway park  it was a beautiful day to spend with friends!!!  good to see you all!!
this is turning out to be a beautiful day!
"no children   going back to bed for a while, then taking a bike ride by myself, shopping, and then kids again   sounds like a good day!"
nothing like working on the weekend!
i wish the weather would decide what it is going to do because my yard could really use some of my attention!
gotta love having kids!  i had to go on a caffeine run and left the baby with the other kids   told them to watch him  ha!  i come home and he had pooped and then smeared it everywhere!  i am still lmao!!!!
a full day of yard work   happy that i will be able to sit on my couch this winter and not feel guilty   smile 
home from a busy day at work!  watching monsters vs  aliens with the kids and checking out fb   tgif!!!!!
"ok, the green bay fans that boo'd favre should be ashamed of themselves!!!!  the man started every game for 16 seasons and won super bowls for them and this is how they welcomed him?!  shame on them!!!!"
"i am a hunting widow for the weekend! yeh!  i have a day off! yeh! yeh!  the kids are going to grandma and grandpa's later this afternoon!  love them, but - yippee!  what is a girl to do all by her lonesome?!  lol!"

"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear  while you humiliate, offend, and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your woman cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her  repost if you're against domestic violence "
