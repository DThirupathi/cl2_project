"being sick is annoying, but gives me a lot of time to play dragonage"
farm town is just farmville that sucks 
facebook has just become the site i go to in order to play video games online   also woo castle age!

"is playing the team <propfemale> theme song while shooting <propmale> candles and firework tanks at tan army men too much, or the epitomy of american ideals?"
"our apartment is confirmed, and approved without cosigners this time "
the modern corporate culture which fires figureheads for the failings of the corporation reminds me of samurai being pressed into seppuku to avoid shame 
"i just functionally beat world at war, and the anticlimax is bitter but not surprising   the last boss of any facebook game turns out to be the moment you realize how pointless the game itself was   they're like <propfemale> versions of an mmo, but the game play is even more of a treadmill and the social aspects are all but gone   i think i may be done with them, at long last "
"i hereby renounce all facebook games   i have removed and blocked them, and i'm am giving up the habit "
without all the various games i really don't have all that much to do on facebook

"i just woke up from a bizarre dream, the last thing i remember was an incoming rocket, and an e playful losion that knocked me into the air   i felt the sensation of hitting the ground and found myself on my living room floor, coughing and desperately looking for my gun before realizing it was just a dream i'd had after falling asleep on the couch, and then falling off of said couch in my sleep "
"in the dead of night i laid next to her, holding her, even though she won't remember   as i held her i felt her body ease, sleeping more soundly in my arms, and i remembered something i too often forget   this time is precious, and fleeting, but for that moment my mind was clear, for that moment i existed with her, in the quiet of the night, and found a moment of bliss "
"on my 4th day at evergreen i had a transcendent e playful erience, as part of a class   i didn't realize until today how much i had forgotten about my nature as a mystic "

"i've just acquired the first part of my halloween costume, and i'm enjoying it a bit more then i should "

"i only have two serious tests this quarter   i spent the night before this one in sleepless tossing and turning, and woke up with the sensation that there was ice in my veins, hastily did the test, then shambled home to collapse   it's going to take a lot of work to correct for this "
i need recommendations for audiobooks   i'm going to be driving around a thousand <propmale> this weekend 
"i have been feeling deeply lost recently, and today i've realized that i need to hold onto this feeling   this is the pain of fading back into my normal self from my true self, it's the confusion at the sudden absence of light, and it may be my only hope for making genuine change "
"i am e playful eriencing a kind of mental breakdown   i would like to discuss this with people, but not right now   tomorrow, inquire, but right now i think i just need to hold onto the gash in my mind, and understand what it's trying to tell me "
i had a flash of insight today   it's time for me to build a new altar 
"setting facebook up to answer questions like \why were you born\"" seems like i might be asking too much of facebook """
"a movie i'm just starting on netflix opens with the starz play, made for tv movie thing, followed by a tv-ma for nudity, language and content   it was a beautiful shot of nostalgia to staying up to watch late night cable porn back in the mid 90s "
"<propmale> miller, 1932-2010, was nothing short of legendary   he left this world just after midnight this morning   may he find the rest and peace he so richly deserves "

"there's a perverse joy that comes from walking around in 20 degree weather wearing flip flops and a v-neck shirt   it's a joy that quickly freezes to death, but still "

"i spent $200 on a very large book that discussed all of basic physics from newtonian motion through optics and electronics   today i spent $200 to buy 15 or so books, which together weigh about the same as that one physics book   the real difference is that this time i'm going to actually read all of the two thousand pages of books i've just purchased "
"i'm getting progressively more and more concerned about the amount of information i'm putting on the internet  hence the newfound lack of any photos that tag me, and any real information on my facebook profile "
"tycho, of penny-arcade, has some kind of bizarre lens through which he speaks to the twisted chords in the darkened cloisters of the infinite labyrinth in the parts of my mind that lie beyond mortal definition   it's the only e playful lanation i have for his effortless ability to reinterpret rihanna's distrubia as a tale of lovecraftian madness, and to immediately impart that same interpretation to me "

"the cleanse has officially begun   the lemon juice, syrup and cayenne mixture is more intense then i e playful ected it to be "
"i think the reason this cleanse has so much cayenne in it is to train your body to be afraid of consuming things   the hunger hasn't been that bad, and i'm crediting it entirely to the system shock that comes from drinking the lemon juice cayenne cocktail "
there's something about waking up to this much cold gray snow just makes you want to quit   it's that ursine instinct to go back to sleep and wait until the world is a bit less depressing

"i think i'm done with d&d, and probably with wotc in general   it takes only a quick review of the last campaign to realize that the parts that i really enjoy are coming from <propfirst> <propmale>'s storytelling, the interplay between the party members, my own love of writing characters, spending time with my friends, and the genius of writing a cross generational story   none of that really needs the d&d system "
