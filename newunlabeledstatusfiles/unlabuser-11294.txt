"here are some of the things  honesty, caring for people, living life not just for yourself and the exact opposite of the things above  that is what makes a man  just my thoughts at the moment"
"what makes a man a man? ill tell you, the level of control over a woman does not make a man a man, just beacause he can get her to say yes to anything and live in fear does not make him a man  also lazyness does not make a man a man the classic concept where the woman does all of the cooking and cleaning is bs men have arms and legs it does not hurt to help a little bit  now what does make a man?"
first day of school tomorrow wish me luck
"any one that is going to be catching the rapid ride at ellison, the parking lot is full  so park in sams club, best buy or borders parking lots"
