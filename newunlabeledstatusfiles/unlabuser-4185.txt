egh   i loathe sun burns   sad 
"i'm not ready to let go of the memories just yet, not ready to believe my dreams were crushed  every now and again i begin to think that i can get through this  that i can find a new dream, but i am reminded on days like this that time can't always fix th"
is skeptical  i'm not as gullible as you think i am  something is going on and i intend to find out what your motives really are 
"is going to crash sometime around mid day due to lack of sleep and energy, so please, if you value your life and your head steer clear  "
wow  last night was trippy  
yeah  got my hair fixed today  it's blonde again  
"i'm not your sweet heart, baby cakes, <propfemale>, <propfemale>, boo, sweety, cup cake, darling, or baby   so don't call me that!!!! *do i look like i am a *insert nickname* to you?*"
"it is then that i see orange sunrise settling into the distance of your brown eyes  it is then that i see how every shade falls into place, how every undertone is met with vibrant bliss  "
"a broken heart is often given a grace period but after that time has e playful ired, it is then that one begins the fall from grace  there one shall distinguish what character they posses  it is there one decides; is it worth crying over what you cannot control,"
:-:echo:-:
was surprised she got to go out tonight   and had a good time too 
throw me to the flames  let the memories and feelings burn but save my soul so that i might be able to distribute the dust   
"this is what happens when i mess with hair dye   stop sign red, light blonde, and now black   egh  when will i ever learn?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!"
 love  :-: lost :-:  love

had a really good time last night   *wink*  love 
misses our conversations    where are you when i need you?!?!?!!  sad 
"i can feel the shadow of what used to be invading my mind  i can see every mistake, every fault  when i open my eyes i see the outcome unfolding, the plot thickening and no way to escape reality   that is when i put the head phones on, close my eyes, and "
is going to kill a certain someone for keeping me up because now i can't sleep   you know who you are!!  annoyed   sleep deprivation is not what i need right now 
missing you   love 
can't sleep   who wants to party?? lol
is thinking of you  
is confused   *sighs*
is questioning your motives 
"pancake!!! yeah, that's right, i said it  pan-flipping-cake "
where can one find truth when one lives in lies   where can one find happiness when one lives in shadow  the answer lies within   it is in ones self that you find strength of heart and character  life is a journey full of friends and foes and one can only hope that when the lights are turned off you know exactly who you are and where you stand   because no one can help you if you can't help yourself first  
"never again, never again  *shakes head*"
wants to act on the impulse she gets whenever she sees talks to you   *fakes running away screaming and bashes her face against the wall*
can't wait to go to <propmale> tomorrow night!!  love

things were so much easier back in the day  
 love  :-: rainy days :-: ?
wants to party!!
*yawn*
"truth is a virtue i often seek yet rarely find   for if we all told the truth, our motives would be clear; less deceitful  but why would a liar tell the truth when he knows it will ruin him? why be a victim of one's own demise by will? truth is a virtue worthy of praise   for not many wish to hear it and not many wish to convey it "
is tired from a long days work  
wishes things were easier  
"so yes, school  tomorrow  oh joy  better program the coffee machine again  lol"

insomnia rocks my world   no wonder i'm always passed out in kinkade's class

got acknowledged for another poem that i wrote  not looking forward to presenting it tomorrow  like i said   i'm going to be famous one day  remember my name 
"17, just another year "
fear is much like falling  falling into the midst of trust and deceit  falling into hopes and desires  into fantasy and reality  out of hate into love and out again  much like falling in the sense that everything feels out of control  your heart pounds  your mind obsesses over the inevitable  past merges with the present muddling the mind as it free falls into the unknown 
thanks everyone for the birthday wishes!
is thinking   what's next?
"so fly, lyrically gangsta till i die  :- sad  ? ):-:"

"words are meaningless, they hold no weight with me because with words anything is possible   with words, you can create any emotion and make it believable, but in the end you cannot gain what is lost  for something so potentially powerful, words sure are weak  "
"iâ€™m remembering a life i havenâ€™t lived  thoughts turning into memories  a world of possibility drowned by reality  a tragic beauty and a false assumption, that i have loved and lost and have turned out better for it  "

"sometimes all you can do is smile when you hate the world  not because you have a positive outlook, but because at the end of the day every other emotion between hate and anguish is exhausted  you smile because those who you care about most are blissfully blind to your suffering and the irony kills you  you laugh because you're in too much pain to cry   and you walk away because you're too afraid to face the truth "
"go ahead, put ur gun to my <propfemale> becuz u think that will make the situation anymore real than it already is   i can't tell u that the sky is the limit when there are footprints on the <propfemale>, and i can't make u believe when u look up at the sky and tell me that u don't see anything  but what i can tell u is that if at any given time u open ur eyes to find me standing here, know that i have never left ur side "

"finds it pretty damn discouraging when ppl form assumptions abt you based on the past  who i was 2 years ago is not who i am today  i kno i made things difficult for myself because of what i did in the past, so maybe i deserve being treated like this   but what gets me is that even tho i have changed, ppl haven't taken the time to acknowledge that  if you don't kno me personally, then keep my name out of your mouth "
