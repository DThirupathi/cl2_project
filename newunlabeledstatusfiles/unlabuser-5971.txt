<propmale> film festivel is hands down amazing  so very sad that today is the last day 
i learned something today  film noir is insanley fun to write  working on a script for a short film now 
"i finished the first draft of the script script  \russian roulette\"" a film noir story """
"in sc  my parent's friends are great hosts  they have, literally, a library of films  i plan on watching <propfemale> trek    and <propfemale> trek ii    and iii    and iv    and v    and <propfemale>  me trek-a-thon starts tonight  also, phone is lost, don't try to call me "
"i suffered through new <propfemale>  really? <propfemale> is one of the most shallow, weak, selfish, and manipulative characters i have ever seen  this film goes out of its way to say its like <propmale> and <propfemale> and how dare it  stuff like titanic earned that, this did not  i also have never seen so many shirtless guys with 6-packs in a film "
happy thanksgiving! at this current time i have 4 hours and 15 minutes till the <propfirst> brown special!
"bad news: new <propfemale> has made a 1 4 of what transformers 2 made in a single week great news: it's <propmale> irizarry's birthday today! if you don't know him, go to my friends list, find him, and wish him a happy birthday! he is now officially 18! <propmale> irizarry"
"just finished writing my third and assuming last draft of russian roulette  was a lot of fun but spaced things pretty wierdly on paper so what was 16 pages in notebook paper was only 8 1 10 pages officially  overall, my first venture into film noir was a good one "
i would walk all the way to california if it ment watching austrian death machine live  why aren't they bigger? who dare say that they wouldn't want to hear the terminator be in a heavy metal band? who i ask?!
doing french makes will sad    but watching <propmale> schwarzenegger act in total recall cheers me up    his jaw moves and his voice makes noises only monkeys should be able to make 
i'm getting ready to leave for disney world for the rest of today for my mom's birthday  all wish her a happy birthday! <propfemale> mccormac wegner
tis the season to be joyous and happy   the colds winds are a blowing   the feel of christmas is upon us   as we come together in one way or another   spreading the joy of this chirstmas season   far and wide for the world to see   our undying devotion to this happiest time of the year   <propfemale> christmas!
"avatar  its not better then starwars but it'll be the epic sci-fi of this generation  but i dislike the main message  i'm pretty sure everyone knows that white people were really bad to indians  i'm tired of films reminding me that my white ancestors were mean  i loved the film, hate the message behind it, but no matter, this is going to make alot of money  despite all of this, i hope he makes two sequals "
"i'm in <propfemale> for christmas  went through philidelphia yesturday  philly is a great city with the greatest philly cheese steaks ever in history  i mean, they are nuclear greese balls that'll kill you by the time your 25 but my god are they good  oh, and i ran up the museum steps    twice "

"i just saw the world according to garp for the first time  it literally took my breath away  i'm in shock about how great of a film it was  i didn't like it, i loved it "
"the fighter, the town, true grit, brooklyn's finest, youth in revolt, daybreakers, repo men, a nightmare on elm street, machete, buried, let me in, my soul to take, little fockers, and frozen were the 2010 films i wanted to see but missed and thus were not considered for my top films of the year "
"a serious man was a great film  well, it was great until it simply ended out of nowhere  i love the coen brother and i understand they have a style but the ending is inexcusable  you easily could have put in an extra half-hour but no, it just ends  literally, questions unanswered and a tornado forming in front of a main character then cut to black  did i miss something?"
"wow  i studied from around 9 or 10am to 3:20pm for exams  and i get to do it all over tomorrow  i still do not understand why we're having them now instead of before christmas break, the logical ending to the 2nd quarter  but oh well "
one day of exams done  two more to go  my brain is tired 
"exams are finally over! the healing of the brain can begin! <propfemale>t off with watching <propfemale> trek again, then go out and see book of <propmale>, and best of all    go to sleep and not wake up at 6am for three glorious days "
avatar has made 1 8 billion dollars now  there is no longer a single film in the history of cinema that can say that they made more money  we have spent more money watching a fun sci-fi retelling of the indian story iraq story then any other film in history  did it really deserve it?
"i've now spent close to three hours trying to get steam to work  if you know what the program steam is, you know had bad this is  its not going to work "

"i finally found something worse then punisher: warzone! something that is so bad in eevry aspect! something with terrible graphics and horrible musics scores! something with level design so bad that it would make the makers of dark sector shaked their head  deadly premonition on the xbox360 is worse then punisher: warzone  hell, its worse then e t  the video game "

dark city is by far one of the most creative movies i've ever seen in my life  existenz is an amazing mind-flipping movie that will keep you up but falls apart after a second viewing  strange days is <propfirst>'s take on a genre almost entirley populated by low-budget idie film makers and its damn good  <propmale>'s ladder is an amazing balance of body horror and phycological horror 
go usa! 1-0! the <propmale> refs tried to keep us down but we have and always will overcome anything in fifa! go usa!
"karate kid was very good and it did a great job of updating, 8 10  now is as good as the original? that really depends how you feel about the decade that the original one was made  it was a very good remake but i think the script was much longer then the finished product "

"heading towards the rock n roll musuem, can't wait to go but i did see inception  inception is, first reaction, a 9 10 and could have been even better but it has a really last-minute-thrown-in twist ending and the editing is horendous in some parts of the film "
"i am finally back in <propmale> and there is ni parade, moose, platypyus, but i did see a few baloons so your all off this time but next time i better get something extra  like two mooses or a platypus tied to a baloon "

"playing through doom 3 to distract myself from starcraft ii and you know what i've realized? doom 3 is a glorious rip off of half-life and some shitty horror elements  seriously, its all the same or altered form of half-life  half-life + doom setting + bad horror elements = doom 3"
"just got done watching the hulk (2003) for the first time in about 7 to 5 years  that film is a lot deeper and a lot better then people give credit for  sure, its not really hulk, its something much greater and deeper then a big green guy smashing stuff for 2 hours  its a very different film that demands a lot but seriously  give this film another shot and go in with a clear head  its about a 7 5 10 or a 8 10"
"a 68-year-old film critic who says video games cannot be <propmale> is as much a fool as a 34-year-old gamer who says film cannot be <propmale>  <propmale> is the e playful ression of human creativity and imagination in pursuit of a goal  the goal can be anything, to entertain, to inform, to inspire  paintings, music, films, plays, books, and video games all can be <propmale> and in a way, all are  there is nothing that everyone in the world can enjoy"
"after reading <propfirst> pilgrim (the first three volumes), the movie does seem better  its gone from 3 5 10 to 5 10 in my book  the best part is that there's actual characterization for people besides <propfirst> and more then 5 funny jokes "

"is reading little brother by <propfirst> doctorow for summer reading  for the past 50 pages, its been about the us gov torturing a 17 year old kid because they think he's a terrorist  saying its \liberal\"" is putting it nicely and \""anti-homeland security anti-american gov\"" is putting it bluntly """
who else misses mystery science theater 3000?
<propfirst> <propmale> has throat cancer  what a perfect way to turn a great day into a depressing day  this just isn't right 
reading little brother is a painful e playful erience  would it have been too much for <propfirst> doctorow to assume his readers aren't complete idiots? could he have even tired to be subtle? could it have killed him to even attempt to show both sides?
"<propfirst> doctorow is a crazy, political maniac, patriot act hater, hippie sympathizer, conspiracy theory madness, and a bad writer  its like if <propmale> stone went crazy, lost his ability to write, and tried to write fiction after watching 1984 "
"sorry for my rants but you'll be hearing a lot of me complaining about little brother for awhile  so, in advance, sorry for being really whiny "
i just finished little brother  its over  its finally over  what i know is that i walk away from this book with a lot of my sanity left behind but all i know is that its finally over

<propfirst> <propfirst>'s why did i get married too is the most surprisingly good movie i've seen  i went in e playful ecting an hour and a half of <propfirst>'s comedy to pass the time and found a surprisingly well written drama that dissected marriage problems and life in general  anyone who says <propfirst> <propfirst> is a hack needs to watch why did i get married too all the way to the end 
"i removed my last post because if i actually have to give you a reason for why burning a qu'an or any piece of literature is bad, you're already lost "

"the international is pretty good and, while the story does get crazy, its all done so well i didn't mind  the acting was good and the cinematography was amazing  also, out of two action scenes, the shootout in the rotunda is one of the best shootouts i've ever seen in my life  at the core of it, the international has a sad message to tell the world but its just executed so well, you've gotta like it  7 5 10"
"i'm pretty sure vindictus is one of the best free to play game i've ever played and one of the best mmos i've ever played  i've only played a few hours so i won't give it a rating yet but so far, it's looking pretty good "
i never knew our legal system was so bureaucratic and full of shit 
i hate spending 15 minutes trying to fit a thought and e playful lanation into 420 characters and then getting fed up and saying screw it  basic thought without e playful lanation: to read the social network's script alone and calling it terrible is just pissing on the entire crew of social network and proving your ignorance of film by judging a film (visual medium) as you would a novel (non-visual medium) 
"imagine if someone made a silly, comedic, conspiracy theory non-terrorism die hard movie in 1991  you'd basically get the last boy scout  i'm pretty sure the director told <propmale> \act like your <propfirst> mcclane and you need a smoke 24 7!\""  6 5 10  the last boy scout stars <propmale> <propmale> and <propmale> wayans"""

"zodiac is an 8 5 10  besides the great writing and directing, the film is one of the most horrifying of all  there is no suspension of disbelief  this all happened  the non-fiction book this was based one only has a couple of minor differences  that's what makes this film so terrifying, what we see really happened  the perfect crime was committed, multiple times, by the same man and his name is <propfirst> <propfirst> <propfirst> "
