"often people attempt to live their lives backwards; they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want, so they will be happier   the way it actually works is the reverse   you must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want "
"i f someone listens,or stretches out a hand,or whispers a kind word of encouragement,or attempts to understand a lonely person extraordinary things begin to happen   "

"so grateful that i can now e playful ress my feelings about things  and actually be honest about it  looking foward to days to come  excited, an a bit nervous, but completely ready for whatever the the outcome may be  (hopefully a great one! lol )"
"we all feel at times as though we are deficient in ways that other people are not  we must keep in mind that where the road is crooked, god makes it straight, and where our hearts are wounded, god makes it hole  our spiritual perfection is not altered by our imperfect personalities  forgiving others is the only way to forgive ourselves, and forgiveness is our greatest need "
"again and agian, the impossible problem is solved when we see that the problem is only as tough decision waiting to be made \~robert h  schuller"
"pain and suffering ends only when you want it to  put your past behind you and move foward  never back down from what life may throw in you face  ,"
life is about trusting our feelings and taking chances  losing and finding happiness  appreciating the memories and learning from our past  sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can change your life forever  
i've dealt with my ghosts and i've faced all my demons  finally contant with a past i regret  i've found you find strength in your moments of weakness  for once i'm at peace with myself  there comes a time in everyone's life when all you can see are the years passing by  and i have made up my mind that those days are gone  i'm moving on

"don't let your past dictate the present and your future happiness, if you spend to much time looking into the past you'll never see what's in front of you  slowly learn that the past creates who you are today, but it doesn't limit your current choices  sometimes you have to get lost, in order to find yourself again   "
