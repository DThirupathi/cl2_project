"mr president,i hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military starting next year  would you also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country? while you're at it, lets cut down congressmen's pay, too  if the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay, why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits? keep this going if you agree      "
