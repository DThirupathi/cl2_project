it's so easy to get lost in constantly having to present whatever face you believe a person wants to see rather than your own 
"see the months they don't matter it's the days i can't take, when the hours move to minutes and i'm seconds away "
"work at 8pm, yay "

"locked myself up in a room without a window, just to see if it was any easier to breathe "
"well see what you wanna see, you should see it all  well take what you want from me, you deserve it all "
"i can't get started from the part where i left off, yesterday  should of spent my time a little wiser  i sat alone guilty as sin, waiting for words to come from out of my head  am i still making sense to anyone?"
why do girls that are with other guys or love other guys always hook up with me   ?
"i can't wait to understand the reason, i've yet to translate any meaning besides, it's not worth it to try "
"but baby don't cry, cause you had my heart  at least for the most part, cause everybody's gotta go sometime  we fell apart, lets make a new start  because everybody's gotta go sometime  but baby, don't cry "
