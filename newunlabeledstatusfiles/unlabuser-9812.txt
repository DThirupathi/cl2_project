life is short until you have the everlasting love with the savior  dont fear to love even if it ends in hurt  love everything you do and you will have satisfaction when glorifying god through it all  life and love is so confusing dont run away from it when you get hurt just keep trusting god that everyone will benefit in your everlasting love

wow brie just did that really not to long ago found it under <propfirst>'s playpen blinking with like 8 missed calls from trying to find it when on silent 
here is one i heard on the radio ( do comic writers have to work harder when congress is not in session ) lol i think they do probably have to work harder without that extra help from the government 
was at knobels with the girls was a nice day a little hot but really nice  <propfirst> was great and the girls had fun as far as i know that is what amusement means fun times 
so play me some mountain music like grandma and grandpa used to play  im glad i dont live in iowa right now with the flooding im thankful for that i dont live there 
now the number for the day is 13 do i need to say more ooooooooooooooooooo  frustrating day at work full of idiots need another job just for sanity reasons gonna kill someone wish hersheypark was a full time job instead of part seasonal
"i like <propfemale> haws \where oh where are you tonight  why did you leave me here all alone  i searched the world over and thought i found you love  but you met another and pffffffffffft you were gone!"""
just worked the evening at the park was great did not rain on me did trash detail and actually loved it felt like old times  the one thing that sucked today was the drive home  just me and another car on 422 east and what do you know he rode my ass from annville to lebanon boy i hate that with no cars for <propmale> in front or back i almost slowed down more  god bless all 
"\if you're lost and you look you will find me time after time\""   \""if you fall i will catch you i will be waiting time after time\"" just love this song and i would do this \""time after time\"""""
yeah my full time work week over capt  and coke time now i get to do my fun job i enjoy hersheypark find out tomorrow when go to work at 1pm my whole schedule  not sure what days and time going to be working
today was good day at the park the one bad thing is my schedule they scheduled me tomorrow in the evening need to work morning well maybe thing will work out and by the way <propfemale> brandt young lady you need to slow down when driving you flew past me and another quite quick slow it down a little it not that important to drive that fast to get home love ya and god bless everyone
"i may not be good at much of anything but im good at drinking beer (o k  maybe not beer but do like capt and coke and fuzzy navels) but definitely not good at anything especially having a long-lasting,loving marriage didnt do that right"
well had my cry for the day this evening  why is life so sad confusing and why is country music so emotional  plus watched a little tv before grabbing a capt coke and that was emotional also so i was crying a bit  work was good and i did not get rained upon yeehaw  god bless everyone 
today was a fun day at work at break a rabbit jumped unto our sanitation crew and the guys were trying to catch it until they were told to not harm damage hershey property since the rabbit was part of hershey property they left it alone lol

hey found 69 cents at work walking around hersheypark at least im not completely broke
why is it always when you are looking for something its always in the last place you think of  the answer by the way is because you stop looking after you found it in that last place 
holiday fading away need to break out some capt and coke and try to forget my boredom god bless everyone have a great remaining weekend
everyone have a great safe holiday  looks like another beautiful day in <propfemale>  what a wonderful state we live in with the different seasonal changes all year round  god is great with providing such beauty for everyone to love in every type of condition 
why do i listen to people at work supposed to work 6am to 3pm i knew better that there wasnt gonna be much to do  well here i am 3hrs later not at work and feel like i wasted my time  i feel like that with life in general like all i did was waste peoples time in whatever i do  the only one i know i listen to 100% is god and he will never lead me astray like a lot of idiots in this world  god bless on beautiful day
looks like another beautiful day in <propfemale> but i do hope it rains soon everyone have a great day midweek soon weekend will be here 
looks like another cool night to sleep to but the way im sleeping lately how do i enjoy sleeping when i get maybe 3to4 hours of good sleep
