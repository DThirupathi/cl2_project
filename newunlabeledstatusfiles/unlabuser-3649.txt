he who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command 
"men ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed, for if you merely offend them they take vengeance, but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate, so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared \- niccolo machiavelli"
