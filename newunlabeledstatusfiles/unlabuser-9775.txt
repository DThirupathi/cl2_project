"you are never going to see this, but on the off <propmale>  i wish i listened to you  i wish i chose you  i'm sorry "
"everything happens for a reason, and sometimes good things come out of bad situations  i hope that is true "
"\calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier  calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter    all you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you \"""""

oh and no one else should probably talk to me today because i got in a <propmale> fight with <propfirst> and it looks like all my moving plans are falling through  i'm freaking out 
"should i unblock him so i can get shit for another restraining order? it's been five fucking years  it's bad enough i have memories, i don't deserve to be harrassed by a psycho "
"does anyone know where i can find a copy of the 'review of general psychology special issue on video games, vol  14  no  2' that won't cost me $25?"
