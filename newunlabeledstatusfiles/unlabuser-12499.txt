"here is the deal world   i lost my cell phone hopefully i will get a replacement soon, but i'm gonna need all of my <propfirst> back "
so i think being diagnosed with strep and mono is a bad thing but im not sure 
my baby <propfemale> is gone from my life at least for now but <propfemale> needs to come to the barber with me next time to make sure i don't fuck it up 
is deleting his facebook as soon as he gets all the <propfirst> he needs so the sooner that happens the sooner i can quit this online crap 
"its gonna be real funny when you realize that you can throw your best my way, and i'm still gonna be on top "

is mourning the loss of one of the greatest loves of his life 
is trying not to mess with people 
i'm glad we elected obama for his ability to bring about the great change he promised   oh wait that never happened 
"so basically what i'm learning is that advertising is a monster, but also inevitable"

"what do i think? perhaps that every living person can choke on my <propmale> and die! ok i didn't get why people would steal my busted phone, but now my textbook   wtf really what could some random person possibly want to know about accounting & law for?  i would excuse the good honest people from this list, but i'm doubting that any of you exist "
does not in fact have two tests tmrw  the sun just started shining a little brighter 
talkin to my baddest bitch! best time ever
"not concerned with who you are, but hey you got style"
"on a lovely combo of codeine, muscle relaxers, and nyquil   oooohhh life is good "
life lesson: the economy is stimulated by spending   who spends? those with money obviously   so taxing the wealthy at a higher rate makes sense why?  oh thats right it doesn't 
everybody loves raymond   its true they do or should 
my tooth hurts so incredibly bad ima go cast away style and bash it out with a rock
