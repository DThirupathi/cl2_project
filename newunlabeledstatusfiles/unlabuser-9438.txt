"i've learned that whenever i decied something with an open heart i usually make the right decision  a wise person learns from the e playful erince of others  an ordinary person learns by his or her own e playful erince  a fool learns by nobody's e playful erince! but the most important thing that i've learned through it all is that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life goes on and it wil be better tomorrow!"
"if love is said to be the most beautiful thing to acquire, why does it hurt so much?"
it's been raining for the past few days and                   need i say more?

"i don't pretend to kno what love is for everyone, but i can tell you what it is for me;love is knowing all about someone & still wanting to be with them more than any other person love is trusting them enough to tell them everything about yourself, including the things you might be ashamed of love is feeling comfortable & safe with someone,but still getting weak in the knees when they walk into a room & smile at you "

"as i get older i've come to realize that i can close my eyes to the things that i do not want to see, but i cannot close my heart to the things that i do not want to feel    (smh #so wat should i do?)"
"don't ever give up if you still want to try \don't ever wipe your tears if you still want to cry \don't ever settle for just any answer if you really want to know why \don't ever say you don't love him if you really can't let him go "
