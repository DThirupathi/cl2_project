"securities has great terms like purchase money security interest and perfection  i get the terms, but have no clue how they are to be used by the speaker  i guess i will randomly spit out definitions on the bar  maybe they can improve this class for the next time  his rambling makes it harder to learn  the monotony prevents optimal absorption of information  and pictures help    "
