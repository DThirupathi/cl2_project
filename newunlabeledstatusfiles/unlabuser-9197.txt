"hello everyone   fixing to go to bed   working on a little bit of a perl program, but generally just running down the evening   working on cabinets   need to post some pics soon "
"back in <propfemale> today   has anyone driven the skyline road in the shenandoah national park?  is it worth driving? it is a straight shot to where we are going, but i am sure it is not as fast as interstate driving   if it is worth looking at, however, i might consider it "
"can't sleep  keep waking up with story ideas  wrote a few pages today on my smartphone on the plane  wonder exactly how wacko it is to write pages of a story on a smartphone  in related news, i have gone through two keyboards on my htc touch pro 2  never dropped, and no abusive usage  no moisture, no shock  keyboard just dies  the result is a total meltdown of the phone  stupid that normal use can do that "
"<propmale> placed the glide board down carefully, taking a moment to ensure all of its weight rested on the raised rubber ridges that criss-crossed the big eighteen foot square solar collector panel  it was still very early in the morning, only a little while after sunrise "
"setting the bucket and sponge down on top of the board beside the nozzel-ended hose, he ran the pucker of his lips sideways and chewed thoughtfully at the inside of his mouth, hands on his hips as he stared at the dirty panels  there was no easy way to do this, he knew; it simply had to be done "
update to anvil's absolution on my profile <propfemale>   the work continues 
"the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but i have promises to keep,  and <propmale> to go before i sleep,  and <propmale> to go before i sleep   from <propfirst> frost's stopping by woods on a snowy evening"
"just finished the last sip of the botran in my glass while smoking a <propmale> patel vintage 1990 cigar on the back porch  with a weekend of work behind me, and demo and a trip to <propfemale> on the books for next week, it was a nice moment to sit back and relax before i re-enter the maelstrom"
"tired, wore out, and generally exhausted   need to prepare for a flight to <propfemale> tomorrow after a demo   i work with the best team in the world, though, so there isn't much to worry about "
can't believe how happy i am to be boarding the plane 
grrrr    doing e playful ense reports 
i got a little more written on the plane   i'll post it when i get back to san <propfirst> 
"before the weekend is up, i will update the link on my profile to the story with this week's changes   it's so exciting "
an update to anvil's absolution is up   have a read if you have a <propmale>   i am very happy with the progress so far 
"at the point where i need to think about the outing, work on the fight scene, do the recovery, and <propmale> needs to meet dougal after having a run in with bother ahbrams  also, need to introduce fact that <propmale>'s father is dead missing, and that his mother is in an adult care facility after a stroke claimed her ability at higher thought  <propmale> needs to be in a bit of a spiral when he finally gets to talk with <propfemale> "
i just changed dougal's name to everitt
"didn't do any writing on the plane    napped a little and listened to an audiobook  only slept around an hour last night, probably less  travel day with systems issues at work the night before never leaves you much candle left to burn "
"power perceived power, relevance, message saturation, buy in, quid pro quo leverage, patron sponsorship: these are some of the chips in the game of politics  just thinking stuff "
good > clash of the titans > suck  best part of the it was when they pulled out the owl from the first one   that scene only lasted <5seconds
"is it just me, or is the whole 3d movie wearing thin   i've seen 2, and the second one was almost one too many "
"must get work done  it's saturday morning, and i woke up half a dozen times with the intent to get up and do some work  i finally got up, and found myself logging into facebook  it feels like i can come up with a thousand excuses (or distractions) not to do work  but deadlines and due dates stare back at me, and demand their pound of flesh  i suppose that before the day is up, they shall have it "
"well, i got a few pages written this weekend   i need to get just a little bit further, and thirty pages will leap out in one day  just this weird transition at the moment is eating my lunch  not that it is not fun to write, it is just fun to craft exactly what is happening and try to keep it believeable "
"i intend to write this weekend  just so much spinning around at work, hard to maintain any unbroken line of concentration for very long without having an unwelcome thought come along and shatter it  but, i'll also need some time before i sit down with a keyboard staring at me like some impatient inquisitor to plan and create some sort of a goal of accomplishment  prework "
"well, the san <propfirst> river is just a little bit cleaner this morning thanks to a few of <propfirst> cuban's tears   go spurs!"
"sick  sore throat, cough, sinuses and ears  first time i've needed antibiotics in a long time "
"well, i guess we added about 5 sq feet to the house today    all in shower "
"quick poll: if i were to imbed a car stereo in an enclosure in the shower, power it with an atx computer power supply, embed it in a magnetic weather resistant enclosure (think boat) and put some waterproof speakers  in it, would that be reasonably cool? oh, i'd pull ambient air from outside through for cooling with a little fan   put a small lv switch to a 120v relay to power on everything from inside the shower "
"if you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life  there are no limits  there are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them  - <propmale> lee\\the anti-corollary here might be that struggle without a vision of self edification is a miserable way to <propfirst> the fleeting hours of a lifetime"
pressure test successful  ran water from both outlets  on to the pan
"came in after the zoo, took showers, took a nap, going back out for a few drinks and a bite to eat "
in the subway (again)
"in the sport of extreme sleeping, i have discovered that i can sleep just fine against a rail (seated) on a noisy, rocking, stop and starting subway "
"big weather in new york, thunder storms, high winds, tornadoes   \ once again, i bring the weather with me  apparently, they had a tornado in\ the bronx last night, but somehow it didn't make the news "
"working on the shower, just mixed mortar is in the bucket, and it is waiting for the second stir, and soon, i will be slinging it on the floor  fun day  i predict beer in my future in about an hour and a half "
"lot of work today, off to draw myself a beer  smile "
"wow, long weekend of labor  looking forward to going back to work monday"
"found and watched \closetland\"" last night  intense movie  almost un-getable"""
"lots of job work to do, the kind that needs multiple unbroken hours of focused concentration  i'm fixing to get after that here in just a few minutes after i drain this cup of coffee "
"the cat brought a field rat in and was playing games with it on my bed when <propfemale> walked in on it  cat let the rat go, dogs went crazy, <propfemale> is calm, and manages to <propfemale> the dogs  i have to go in, (cat lost the rat in the commotion), and after a long several minutes of stupid human tricks, manage to corner and remove the pest "
"update: as of now, the linens are changed on the bed, dogs are in their crates, cat's outside, and the rat is pining for the fjords  i think a beer and bed are in order "
thanks everyone for the fantastic birthday celebration  it couldn't have been better!
boo     my heff is all gone    just blew foam  i guess i'll have to make another one some day 
"i've been doing nothing but coding for the past few weeks, but for an update on the texas prickly pear red, it is tasting very, very delicious  five gallons is going to disappear in a flash   i think i need to get another batch brewing while tunas are still in season, because this one is not going to last "
"i made an oatmeal stout this weekend with some e playful erimental ingrediants    well, not too e playful erimental, dark chocolate cocoa and blackberries, mainly for smell  i think it will turn out nice, but it is going to be black as pitch  specific gravity was a little lower than i e playful ected, but not too much, so it will be fine"
"i wasn't born for diggin deep holes \i'm not made for pavin long roads \i aint cut out to climb high line poles, but   "
"we had a fantastic weekend  rode out another big thunderstorm in a tent  for a 15 year old tent, it didn't leak much at all   it was awsome, laying in the tent, hearing the whipping wind, seeing all sides strobe with lightning, and hearing the pounding rain punctuated by rolling thunder  couldn't have been better "
"wow, just racked my blackberry chocolate oatmeal stout, and it is just plain good  my fears that the blackberry would be too much were completely premature"
"air conditioner is repaired  i replaced the blower motor and the\ start capacitor for good measure  brushed out the innards of the blower and\ re-installed, reconnecting all wires and conduits  house is cooling down\ now "
just changed my profile pic to what a shrimp boil might look like 
thanks to everyone for enjoying in the shrimp boil  it was a great evening!
soon will have the house to myself for a week 
"wow, <propfirst> nielsen died  the world is now just a little bit less funny "
"mmmm    the <propmale> heff    5 1% alcohol, and nearly good enough to drink flat (before i carbonate it)   i racked it into a carboy, and will leave it there today, and perhaps most of tomorrow to allow more solids to settle, then i'll keg it  its going to be delicious "
"for those interested, this ale is a minimash, and it contains annoyed \1 1 4 lb two row malt\1 1 4 lb vienna malt \1 2 lb <propfemale> munich malt\1 2 lb <propfemale> 60l malt\1 large butternut squash, skinned, de-seeded, and cut up into bits, cooked in the oven at 350 for 1 hour, then broiled on high until it starts to get just a little char on top\\hops are <propmale> golding\\4lb of extra pale and 1lb of munich extract\\pumpkin spice "
"just put the lid on the butternut squash ale, snapped in the airlock, and set it down to start fermenting  it has a 1 052 initial gravity, which is perfect (had to add a little sugar to get it there, though, suprisingly)  in a week, it should be ready to rack  in two weeks, it should be ready to keg  now, off to clean up my mess and think about what kind of wine i'm going to make "
"well, i got 36 lbs of pears, some black grapes for the tanin, some cranberries for flavor, and a bag of kiwis for acidity  i also got two gallons of fresh press apple juice (no additives, no processing, not from concentrate) to make up any distance in volume i might need to complete the five gallon batch  i'll be juicing this afternoon, and should have it in a fermenter just a little while after that "
"everybody seems to be putting cartoon characters as their profile pics, so i'll choose a throwback character    thundarr the barbarian  meh   "
"i just helped <propfemale> put together two animatronic lighted deer that go in the front yard  we brought home 200 feet of christmas lights, which probably isn't very much (i've never put up lights before)  i can't say that i get it, but <propfemale> is as happy as can be, and its very easy to enjoy through her "
"working some more on the shower this morning  i am gluing up pre-finished hardwood flooring to the ceiling, covering up the plywood top  its a <propmale> brown american red oak, and it is looking really nice  after its done, we'll varnish it to seal it from the moisture, and it should be ready to go again"
"finished the chili, bagging it in vacuum bags, ready for tuesday"
"did a bunch of work on the house over the weekend, including a bunch of trim work  <propfemale> is, as usual, making me look good with caulk and wood putty to fill the seams and bring it all together  we'll probably paint this weekend "
"sitting here reading tech docs in the middle of the night  meh, its more entertaining than stupid television  i'm feeling late for my bed, so i'm going to shut it down and call it a day   "
"i've seen and heard quite a bit about the topsy-turvy little upside-down tomato grower, and i was just wondering, if taken to a larger scale, would it deliver similar results  so, i've procured 2 12 foot 4x4's for posts, a long 2x6 for a top piece, and i have a metal-reinforced 2x4 from a previous project that will serve as the hanging bar  armed with these pieces, i begin  more to come"
"i go lay down in bed, and i know immediately that it is not time to sleep  done this three times tonight, still up  mix a drink and maybe then   "
"by the way, not sure if the latticework covering tomato plant upside-down thingy is being helpful, may be blocking too much sun  will continue to watch, may have to take it down for a bit and put it back once plants get bigger  right now just making shade, which is not optimum"
"sitting on the back porch barbequing some chicken, smoking a fine cigar, sipping on a cold beer while listening to <propfemale> hatchet belt out some fine guitar inside  i accomplished all the projects i intended this weekend  i could think of a hell of a lot worse ways to spend time "
"midnight here, trying to get a little work done  got a couple of audiobooks burned in mp3 format (who wants to <propfemale> around all the raw audio cd's) for the next few days ready to go on the long commute "
"i made some <propfemale> adjustments on the drip feeders on the tomato plants  they are looking great  some were way too wet, and others a little dry, so i adjusted the dry drip feeder heads to flow more, and cut the watering time back from 3 to 1 minute  its surprising, the water requirements are really <propfemale>, but of course it will increase as the plants grow larger  i'll let you guys know how it all progresses"
"i am thinking i'd also like to measure how much water is entering the buckets, so perhaps i'll rig up another drip feeder and put it in some sort of graduated container so i can measure consumption  i think it would be fascinating to know just how much water a tomato plant uses throughout its lifespan, and given the controlled nature of their environment, i can find out "
