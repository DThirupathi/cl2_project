"theres nothing ever wrong, but nothings ever right, such a cruel contradiction   i know i cross the line  its not easy to define, i'm born to indecision   theres always something new, some path im supposed to choose, with no particular rhyme or reason"
zombieland is the best zombie movie of decade  killing zombies with a banjo for the win   wink 
some people worry if they left on the stove     i worry about the zombie uprising 
im not really into r&b or rap but i hadnt heard this song in a long time and i figured it would be an awsome intro song to a zombie flick  like while the credits are playing and intro to the cast  its called all i wanna do bang bang  and take your money  its by mia  bad ass for its kind of music and killer zombie movie song lol  but then again so would songs by tenacious d   playful

"heart beat slows, the blood calmly drifting through the veins  thoughts cease and the mind goes blank  serenity is within reach as the body begins to, for once, relax  itâ€™s within reach your fingers grasping into that otherworldly realm  the time spent in meditation is about to pay off  and then something brushes the very deepest depths of consciousness "
"and suddenly you are assaulted by the nightmare of the past and future  youâ€™re ripped from the serene realm of utter silence, and tossed back into the world of shattered hopes and dreams  and when your eyes open, you realize it was no more than a dream "
