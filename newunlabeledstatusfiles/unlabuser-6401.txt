i feel like i haven't had a summer too cold and wet
i think that olsen needs to come back now
<propmale> is a freak
pt test in twenty
"i passed my pt test with 54 push-ups, 72 sit-ups, and 14:24 on two mile run"
"ruck marches suck lots so will the ftx, and i'm sick from the airheads i ate  class is going to be just so fun today, showertime"
may the ftx rot in hell
go state
how did i manage to get so lucky  seriously why does this happen to me
why is it so hard to replace someone?
wondering why i am still on facebook at one-thirty
so lost my phone  don't know where to look anymore  well att looks like i am coming to get a new phone
i hate it when people tell you that your idea is brillant then they think about and determine that while brillant it won't work  has happened twice this week
