hey golfers check pga tour online  if anyone wants to play it's free this weekend 
"came this close to buying athens little store and turning it into a bbq  a friend of mine owns it and was willing to sell for 20k, payable as a percentage of the profit  but the rent was too high and the landlord wouldent allow renovations or even let me change the sign  im just so disgusted i could scream  if i had had the 20k in my hand i could open up a place here in town "
"a weekend spent in retrospect \remembrance with some regret\shining faces i still recall \when all of us were very small"
"as some of you may know i have been working on my fiction writing  in the meantime i have been writing articles and reports on various subjects for a site called rant rave  i get paid by google for advertising clicks  it's nothing <propmale>, but i've made a couple hundred so far this month  if your interested check out the articles  if you see an ad for something you like click it  but no need to go nuts "
tap tap tap tap

happy birfday <propfirst>  i wish you more blessings then you can count 
what do you remember? i remember <propmale> hickey taking a face plant in front of his house from a rather poorly designed ramp
