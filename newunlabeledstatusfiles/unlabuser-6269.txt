"ok, so they are keeping him under observation for a few hours because <propmale>' heart rate is elevated to 190 and normal for a high is 120  his fever is still high  they are giving him fluids, antibiotics, motrin, and tylenol  i wish i was with him right now       can't sleep, very concerned! please pray that he gets better soon "
"ok <propmale> update: he is doing better  they got home at 5am  when he left the hospital he still had a high fever, it has gone down to around 101 102 his heart rate was still about 168 but unfortunatley there is no good way for us to check it at home  good news: he is playing and eating this morning   oh and yelling at his toys  smile    thank you all for your kind words and prayers! i'll post more updates later "
so i woke up and told <propmale> i wanted to go to church this morning and he said that i couldn't until i finished my paper for class! what???? ok dad thanks! can't stand being controlled!
"promise to my children: i will stalk you, flip out on you, lecture you, drive you crazy, be your worst nightmare and hunt you down like a bloodhound when needed   because i love you! when you understand that, i will know you are a responsible adult  you will never find someone who loves you, prays for you, cares about you, and worries about you more than me  re-post if you love your children "
"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear  while you humiliate, offend,and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is  while you hurt her, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away  while you make her cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her  post on your wall if you are against domestic violence & mental abuse "
it's friday!!!!!     laugh

"5 deadly terms used by a woman  (1) fine - this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are right & you need to shut up  (2) nothing - means something & u need to be worried  (3) go ahead- this is a dare, not permission, do not do it  (4) whatever - is a woman's way of saying f**k you  (5) that's ok - she is thinking long& hard on how & when you will pay for your mistake  re-post if u agree"
so tired today! would love to get back in bed for a few hours!
procrastination!  sad

"i've carried children within my body  slept with babies on my chest  i've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts  i've been puked on, peed on, and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair  but i wouldn't have it any other way  my body isn't magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see a mom, and there is no greater honor!! post this as your status if you are proud to be a mom!!!"

"we fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them \\- <propmale> livius"
ok i can't do the walk anymore  i'm sorry for those who wanted to go  the walk is still on if you need information about it but i can't go because of something very important that i can't miss 
i hate how stress gives you headaches  i wish it would go away i have a paper to write and chores to complete and a child that desided to cut a large hole in his shirt in school!
"last week <propfirst> was diagnosed with      adhd       which many of you know, then today at the doctors they told me they think <propmale> may be      autistic       are they for real? very concerned right now and could use a friend!"
