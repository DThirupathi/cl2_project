"going to watch a movie? then bed  i don't know how i haven't just dropped dead yet, i'm so exhausted annoyed  plus i want to know what i got on the math test we took today  eek;~;"
"he said, son when you grow up, would you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
"im having problems lately  i cannot hold anything steady and im really dizzy \humpf stupid stuff for making me tired   _ "

"ugh who eats ramen noodles for breakfast?\\this girl right here  yup "
"young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen  so come a little closer, tell me those three little words "
i give up 
do people really feel the need to interfere with things?  annoyed 
"if i let you in, you'd just want out \if i tell you the truth, you'd vie for a lie \if i spilt my guts, it would make a mess we can't clean up \if you follow me, you will only get lost \if you try to get closer, we'll only lose touch \yes you already know too much, and you're not going anywhere "
ha well driving through that storm was  scary 
i really   want my red hair back 
so i guess what i'm feeling is like a beautiful sadness 
"no more attempting to be something that everyone else wants  either like me for how i am, or leave  it's your choice "

there is nothing worse in the world than thinking you have a <propmale> when you really don't 
i still laugh about that girl who called me a poser for liking mcr every now and then  people who are the real posers entertain me 
"please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but acceptance & equal rights   93% won't copy and paste this     will   you        make it your status for at least one hour?      ? promote love & acceptance, not hate "
"the lovers are loving, but the lovers, they hate me too "
"your knife, my back  my gun, your head "
"besides, people should judge more on a person's personality than how they look, or what they do  pesonality is the most important thing  at least to me "
oh my god  what the hell is that
being sick sucks 
"ha so, if you see me tomorrow morning, but not at like lunch or after, i'm probably dead from being sick and going to dance 1st hour  ohkay "
"i can be sweet, just like reeses, i can be cruel, shred you to pieces  i can be your savior, undertaker, i can be the love of your life, or your heartbreaker "
the dance floor is my stage 
"i am so retarded, why do i do the things that i do ?"
"nobody gets how much i actually try   it doesn't work so well, that i know of anyway  \so i'm stopping  \starting tomorrow "
i am not doing very good this morning   annoyed

i like   your face 
leih mir deine flÃ¼gel 
"love, give me love, give me love, i don't need it, but i'll take what i want from your heart, and i'll keep it in a bag, in a box, put an x on the floor, give me more, give me more, give me more "
i never went to the choir concert  i wanted to  but didn't  but oh well  i'm going to watch how to train your dragon now

"could somebody please e playful lain to me why people get so worried about me being mad at them  it's like it eats away at them or something  most of the time it has nothing to do with you and i'm in a pissy mood so don't even freaking ask what you did, or why i'm pissy  none of your business anyway  ugh  if you can't tell, i'm in one of those moods now, ugh "
"okay, it's nice you're happy about lil <propmale> getting out of jail  but holy shit i'm tired of seeing it everywhere i freakin look  i don't care  at all  he obviously deserved to go because he broke the law  just because he is famous doesn't make him any more special than anyone else who has broken the law "
going to the play tonight   smile 
<propmale> way is attractive  no matter what hair color he is sporting 
l-o-l at the vicious mood i'm in 
"how is it that it's 4 smile 0 pm, and i just barely woke up?"

"i'm not here for your entertainment, you don't really want to mess with me tonight  just stop and take a second, i was fine before you walked into my life "
