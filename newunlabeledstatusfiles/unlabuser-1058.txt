is it possible to have swine flu a (an illness not a hereditary disease) run in your family   in two weeks or less i believe my sister who lives in mo had it and now my mom who lives in mi has it   i swear i better not get that shit the week of my birthday   
thank you everyone for the happy birthdays on wednesday    it was a good one and hopefully this weekend is just as good   
happy new year everyone  best holiday ever! all day football!!! yay!!
so now the only big 10 bowl game win is by iowa that sucks yet on a plus note <propmale> <propfirst> will announce the firing of one the biggest disgraces to uofm soon!
so how bad is it that the big 10 conference goes 1-6 in bowl games but the freaking detroit lions can win 4 games in row?? seriously??? lol
corretion to the previous statement  big 10 went 1-7 in bowl games
happy easter!!
"thunderstorm!!!! hellz yea!!!! sorry <propfirst>, i know you hate them"
rainy day plus no work equals doing absolutely nothing! wow i'm thrilled for to an incredibly boring day filled with silence 
"seeing a bumper sticker that says \out of a job yet? keep buying foriegn\"" isn't very unusal  however seeing it on a toyota is  what is wrong with people?"""
i just want to know what would possess him to do that? i mean seriously he does realize he isn't really mj right? mj got off however i'm think <propmale> will not 
if the homosapiens were in fact homosapiens  is that why they're extinct?
broadcast booth for some well needed fun on this horrible weekend
"how can you fight for something, when you know everyone else is fighting against you?"
nightmare on elm street
so many things have happened in the past 6 years it's hard to believe that i can still remember like it was yesterday  r i p kmt 
i love thunderstorms but i absolutely hate the rain 
love getting screamed at for something i have no control over 
haven't watched snl since the will ferrel <propfirst> kattan days  but i wouldn't miss <propfemale> white for anything  only a few more hours!!
"had a great time this weekend, sad that it has come to an end  so nice to see old friends who have grown into family "
tried to avoid watching grey's tonight so it doesn't end yet  however all of you posting how good it was aren't making it easy on me to hold out 
too many things going on in my head  i just want to run away from it all  i can't figure out which to handle or deal with first 
stupid comcast and their incredibly long waits  and stupid knee being messed up  not having fun today 
haha lovin' the kwame song on wycd!!!
gotta love a good thunder storm!!

thank you for being a friend   r i p  rue mclanahan  anything happens to <propfemale> white and the world would be over 
"everybody's looking for that something, one thing that makes it all complete "
sometimes i wish my life was like a disney movie  the dark and gloomy part is only temporary and there is a guaranteed happy ending 
definitely had a lot more fun last night than i e playful ected too  however i woke up a lot earlier than i wanted to
i seriously hate finally getting the guts to kill a huge spider and then i miss it's lost and i'm paranoid all night 
"i watch the stars from my window sill, the whole world is moving and i'm standing still"
there are few things that i enjoy waking me up in the middle of the night  i gotta say a nice thunderstorm is definitely one of them 
"\this man is dead  yesss  how long has he been dead? since he died \"" who says that??"""
earthquakes and tornadoes in one day?!?!? finally some great weather up in mi  lol
so freaking glad that today is my last day of work crap  downside not making any money for that 6 weeks either
it's finally here  no more pain! well soon to be no more  let's hope i bounce back fast 
pain meds from the hospital were definitely the reason that i didn't feel a whole lot yesterday  today omg!! talk about feeling the pain 
icing my knee and then going to sleep  not much else to do  life is so much easier when you are sleeping 
think i might go sit outside in the sun and read a book  not much else to do

nice and cool outside  rapid flashes of lightning and rumbles of thunder  now this is what i call a nice summer night 
wow  trying to get some sleep  gotta say won't be easy  can't get my head cleared long enough to close my eyes

"if your mom is or was a hard working woman, and is your hero, has helped you no matter how good or bad you were and is just the best mom ever, if you are blessed to still have your mom or if she is an angel in heaven, paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your mom  you can replace a lot of people in life, but you only have one mom ?"
