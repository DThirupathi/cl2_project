"while you scream at your woman,there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear    while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your woman cry there's a    man stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence ?"
