back from  fishing trip     what an adventure
"still feeling under the weather after being in a car accident, but blessed as no one really got hurt in either vehicle"
fires are breaking out all over and wreaking havaoc on friends and familys and they really need our prayers along with all the other people tahe are caught up in all the fires through the states and the world  especally those who are trying to save human lives and those who are trying to keep their  homes safe
a friend of ours    her sister just lost her home in the fire
well the weather here has been our normal rain  for this time of the year except for the extremely high winds  we had a gust of 42 mph this am  the wind has been holding steadily around 18-22 mph last night and today so far  so if we are not on later  you will have an idea as to why  this storm system is supposed to let up sometime tomorrow morning  hopefully

"for all those blessings that you get from others for sneezing really do count  as we found out this past weekend both for family on hawaii and here at home on the oregon coast   we were on  way to an dr\s appt in medford for <propfirst> when we received a voice mail about the tsunami from family """
the devastationial effect it had on us mentally well could not be described as we was worried as we also live in the tsunami zone and mom was staying home to watch the animals  and then family on hawaii   what were we going to do  the only thing we could do was let god take over and pray pray pray 
and on top of all this the <propfirst> was starting to give us trouble  to make a short story shorter we have found someone to work on the <propfirst>  abut we had to stay over night  they worked on a the <propfirst>  and could not get parts till monday  what to do no vehicle to get the family back home over 35 hrs away  the owner new of a tow company that would be able to sell us a car that would make it back to the coast 
3 5 hrs away supposed to be not 35
"the tow truck company owner did come and took me back to his lost ,but everything was too e playful ensive or just would not make it  he brought me back and he called a few of his contacts none was there at their phones  so he was not going to leave us there and he said we could borrow his car   and then said \ what is a christian supposed to  do \"" so we made it back home safe and sound"""
"he also told us to keep the car until  the <propfirst> is fixed  the <propfirst> is being fixed by  a family that has a shop that was giving up their days off to work on the <propfirst> to get it fixed and done properly for us  so all those \blessings\"" you get for everytime you sneeze really do count  you can never be with out to many blessingsso dont forget to hand them back out also  and praise the lord  in the highest!!!!"""

"remember this passage as its my favorite  <propfirst>  15:13 greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his  friends  you see jesus is my friend he will always be there for me and if you look around he is there for others too!! so next time you see one trying to save a life think of jesus saving ours!!"
this is the time we should remember that jesus gave his life so we can follow and be like him  what makes it special that you can see the brotherly love that he has given us for one another  we should love each other with brotherly affection and take delight in honoring each otherdo not pretend to love other :really love them!!
he is alive!!!! jesus is alive!!!!
happy easter everone!!!! he lives!!!!!
