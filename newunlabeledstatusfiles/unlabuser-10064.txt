"i think i need to invest in actual snow gear; sneakers, ankle socks and jeans do not cut it when you are thigh deep in this stuff  also where the heck do you put the snow when you don't have a yard!?!"
"first taxes, now fafsa - the fun never ends!"
you could get a job stomping out <propmale> fires 
"i've had doodle for a month and five days  in that time frame he has been: charged twice by large dogs, bit by a mole, and suffered severely swollen eyes  it has been and adventure "
the dog is very upset at the couch today  he keeps barking at it  very strange 
"tomorrow is doodle's second attempt at getting groomed and a trial run at the kennel to make sure he isn't too \aggressive or difficult\"" for them  i'm so nervous!"""
the kennel was a success even though he was shaking like a leaf  in a few hours we attempt the groomers 
the groomer's was a success as well!! no muzzle needed!!!
so the obedience trainers said my dog is very smart with a strong personality  i don't know if that is a good or not    at least they think he is cute 
thank you everyone for your birthday wishes!
there's nothing like finding an old file and realizing you have most of term paper already written thanks to an old assignment from another class!! woo-hoo!
that is one big <propfemale>
