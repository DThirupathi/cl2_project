it is times like these that i wish we all had solar panels 
"well my son almost destroyed my ps3, he shoved 4 dvds in the slot, its a good thing that i was able to take it apart and fix it "
"ok how do i stop my son from making a huge mess, throughing around my dvd, taking everything out of my wallet, or destroying my ps3, i tried caging all of my stuff but he already figured out how to open it "
"a worm knows one thing with complete faith  eat to live  whether it's moldy dirt or rotten flesh, that worm digs and eats, eats and digs to fulfill its one truth  eat to live  but i hold one now in my undead fingers  it squirms, fighting to free itself  what is it thinking? when i pop it in my mouth and chew its pink flesh, does it realize that you should never place all your faith in one ideal?\ - gauldoth the half"""
i have struggled to understand a universe that allows the destruction of an entire planet  which will win this endless conflict - destruction or creation? the only thing i know for certain is never to place your faith entirely on one side  play the middle if you want to survive  everyone else is a fanatic 
"why can't everyone see the inherent goodness in destruction? or the evil in creation? a <propmale> cannot live without the nutrients provided by the destructive force of a <propmale> fire  and if i am wrong, then why is lifeblood of creation - water - the most destructive force on the planet?"
"so, what is the point if i am but an insignificant pawn of the universe? knowledge! to know the universe is to transcend it  destruction, creation, good, and evil; the grand scheme of things they are just the masks we use to understand that which we cannot grasp  well, here is my hand  show me your secrets  i am not afraid"
"in the scope of the universe, we are but a single breath  to say we're insignificant is to give us too much credit  but when the universe chooses you to be part of its plan, you'd better hold on and take what you can get because your ride will surely be over before you know it!"
"i have a lesson for you, waerjak  see here, a pair of mating spiders, and a scorpion - equally poisonous creatures  watch how the scorpion easily kills the male spider because he is so small  now, the female, enraged by the loss of her mate, attacks the scorpion with everything she's got  you see, she kills the scorpion, but at what cost? her own life  such blind hate is dangerous, and pointless!"
ok im sorry just some interesting points of views that i enjoy 
i so miss my world of warcraft :<
good bye cruel nordstrom world  in 2 weeks i will be free 
"my son is 22 months old, today he wanted to be changed so he grabbed a diaper and changing pad unfolded the pad in front of me layed the diaper next to it and assumed the changing position "

"anyone know a good contract lawyer, i cannot attend school anymore because itt tech put me on the wrong curriculum so when i came here i was kicked out because of it, they of course took my student loans, and government <propmale> money and now i have to pay it all back  to be honest, i had a 4 0 gpa, and am way to smart to not be inventing something new "

"i just saw the kick-ass prescreening, and it was awesome, just a few parts that were better in the comic book, but other than that it is a must see this april, a 10 year old hero, that slices up bad guys, blows their brains out and a mouth that spews out curse words i hardly ever use, oh and did i mention, nerds, lots and lots of nerds? ok just 3 but you'll want to see it!"

"there needs to be an actual inventor's degree  one specifically designed to train the mind to combine ideas, with training in eng, mech, elect, psych, physics, chem, etc  not going in depth with each field, just giving the brain enough information in each to build on  time to evolve people "
