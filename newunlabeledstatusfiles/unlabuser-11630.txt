"<propfemale> update:  well there was good news and bad news   the good news is the ugly thing on her snout is just a really ugly malformed wart, not cancer   the bad news is she has a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, kidney infection and is in renal failure  on top of that she has an abcessed tooth!!!   i knew she had something going on but never dreamed it would be so much "
"31 lost, 31 unwanted visits, 31 doors receive that dreaded knock, 31 families with shattered hearts, 31 pairs of boots lined up with rifles and dog tags and helmets, 31 comrades remembered and grieved for, 31 funeral services, 31 names on newly made grave markers, 31 empty places at the table, 31 souls who gave all, whose lives leave a void, so let's take 31 seconds to re-post this and pause to reflect on such a sacrifice as 31 gone forever "
i need a cake made   anyone know someone or do it yourself?
"i need a few girls who want to party with their girlfriends in september   earn double free stuff!!!!  make it a theme party and have even more fun!  tied up on the weekends?  then party after work or even do a \pop in\"" party   message me for details!"""

"i have spent most of the day trying to get rid of a stupid virus on my computer   i clicked a link on fb this morning on a trusted site, except it wasn't so trusty!  thank goodness for system restore because mcafee sucks!  it couldn't find a problem after taking hours to run "
"so    we're suppose to leave for the outer banks saturday morning   stupid hurricane <propfemale>!  last year a hurricane ran us out 3 days early, i think we paid our dues   go away please!"
doesn't look like i'm going to the beach saturday   sad   i pray hurricane <propfemale> does not hit the outer banks as a cat 4   it will destroy it!  still hoping it goes out to sea 
"to the tune of \come on eileen annoyed ""  \",ed45a9610a53a23dcbd017 laugh c4ab0b01,my wonderful hostess just earned $496 worth or wonderful merchandise for only $178!!!!  i love it!!!  my job is so much fun!
so far so good at the outer banks!  praying the flooding that's going to happen isn't too bad   maybe we can go on monday   rumor is though that there is a new inlet somewhere along highway 12 either before hatteras or in hatteras    sad 
just watched the weather channel and i am amazed at the idiots in <propfemale> beach!  not to mention the guy that just pulled his shorts down behind the weather channel guy and showed his @ss and front side!!!  seriously!!  grow up!  from what i saw he should have kept it in his pants anyway! lol
"widespread flooding in the outerbanks as the sound water rushes back in   reports of water chest high in the streets of manteo   sad   they say it came in in less than 10 minutes   worried about people in cars who thought the worse had passed   i'm watching web cams and people are out driving!  praying for everyone along the east coast   friends, stay safe!"
"my idiot neighbor is mowing grass in the dark! there are no lights, it's dark! he can't possibly see what he's doing   should be pretty come morning! lol"
"looks like we are rescheduling our vacation   sad   the outer banks were flooded after the storm passed   of course, you don't see that on the weather channel!  they still haven't let residents that evacuated back in   they are still assessing the damage and the sound side was hardest hit   i've been following people posting from the outer banks and i'm just amazed at the idiots who are just worried about their vacation!  have some compassion!"
omw! we are on a vacation roller coaster!  now they are saying visitors can re-enter the part of dare county we are staying in   we don't know if our rental house is ok because it's on the sound   the real estate company won't be open until 8 smile 0 so you wouldn't even be able to leave until we call them in the morning   then our rental may not be inhabitable!  what to do!?  drivng us nuts!  i'm really going to need a vacation now!
"well, looks like our vacation has finally begun!  we are loading up and heading to the outer banks   i have mixed feelings since people are dealing with damage to some homes and property   but, if we don't go we lose our money   the insurance won't reimburse us the full amount since they have opened it up to visitors again   praying for safe travels to get us through the traffic congestion i'm sure we will surely encounter   thanks to our housesitter for being available on such short notice!"
"arrgg!  rental company called back   house is damaged   moving to another house   don't really like it, it's not on the beach or the sound but at least we get to go   this is the most stressful vacation   sad "
just watched the lifeguard rescue someone  water is rough today  poor woman could barely walk when the lifeguard got her to shore 
"for dish newtwork subscribers:  dish network is out in many places, even indiana!!  if you want the phone number to vote for landeau murphy, wsaz's facebook <propfemale> will be posting the number to call so we can still vote!!  if you aren't friends with wsaz go like their <propfemale> so you can get the number    one person tried to call dish and the recording said she was number 2600 in line!"

"from a friend: i thought it was well worth sharing, \\christmas 2011 -- birth of a new tradition\as the holidays approach, the giant asian factories are kicking into high gear to provide americans with monstrous piles of cheaply produced goods -- merchandise that has been produced at the e playful ense of american labor  this year will be different  this year americans will give the gift of genuine conce   rn for other americans  there is no longer an excuse t   hat, at gift giving time, nothing can be found that is produced by american hands  yes there is!\it's time to think outside the box, people  who says a gift needs to fit in a shirt box, wrapped in chinese produced wrapping paper?\everyone -- yes everyone gets their hair cut  how about gift certificates from your local american hair salon or barber?\gym membership? it's appropriate for all ages who are thinking about some health improvement \who wouldn't appreciate getting their car detailed? small, american owned detail shops and car washes would love to sell you a gift certificate or a book of gift certificates \are you one of those extravagant givers who think nothing of plonking down the benjamines on a chinese made flat-screen? perhaps that grateful gift receiver would like his driveway sealed, or lawn mowed for the summer, or driveway plowed all winter, or games at the local golf course \there are a bazillion owner-run restaurants -- all offering gift certificates  and, if your intended isn't the fancy eatery sort, what about a half dozen breakfasts at the local breakfast joint  remember, folks this isn't about big national chains -- this is about supporting your home town americans with their financial lives on the line to keep their doors open \how many people couldn't use an oil change for their car, truck or motorcycle, done at a shop run by the american working guy?\thinking about a heartfelt gift for mom? mom would love the services of a local cleaning lady for a day \my computer could use a tune-up, and i know i can find some young guy who is struggling to get his repair business up and running \ok, you were looking for something more personal  local crafts people spin their own wool and knit them into scarves  they make jewelry, and pottery and beautiful wooden boxes \plan your holiday outings at local, owner operated restaurants and leave your server a nice tip  and, how about going out to see a play or ballet at your hometown theatre \musicians need love too, so find a venue showcasing local bands \honestly, people, do you really need to buy another ten thousand chinese lights for the house? when you buy a five dollar string of light, about fifty cents stays in the community  if you have those kinds of bucks to burn, leave the mailman, trash guy or babysitter a nice big tip \you see, christmas is no longer about draining american pockets so that <propfemale> can build another glittering city  christmas is now about caring about us, encouraging american small businesses to keep plugging away to follow their dreams  and, when we care about other americans, we care about our communities, and the benefits come back to us in ways we couldn't imagine  this is the new american christmas tradition \forward this to everyone on your mailing list -- post it to discussion groups -- throw up a post on craigslist in the rants and raves section in your city -- send it to the editor of your local paper and radio stations, and tv news departments  this is a revolution of caring about each other, and isn't that what christmas is about?"
