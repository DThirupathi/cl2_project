black 'a '
i love all of my bros irl and online   you're all such great friends and i'm really glad to have all of you in my life   it sure would be boring without all y'all  love 33
"as much as i love helping others, i get real sick of being my family's punching bag "
"that's it, i'm calling the happy police"
"i really, really hate people that are so self-absorbed with themselves, that everyone else isn't important to them "
-_status update goes here_-
lately i've been wondering if anyone actually does care   
good god i hate people that channel surf
i am going to beat someone   
we must be swift as the coursing river
i really hate not knowing things
"oh my god, why are people so stupid?"
happy single awareness day~
this is a status update 
"i don't understand how i can have so many friends, yet still feel incredily isolated and alone "
"power surges, do not want "
maturity seems to be a lost <propmale> these days 
i hate not having any inspiration 
 :
i wish i owned a time machine :i
"hokai, i got one weight off of my soul, let's see if i can get the rest of them too :i"
the roof the roof the roof is on fire~

happy clovers and beer day!
"lol, i guess i can't just be original anymore "
"dear neighbors, while you have a nice stereo system, the whole neighborhood does not want to hear your shitty music  bl"
golly gee it sure is lots of fun being in constant debt  \\o  
"and once again, i am struck with writer's artist's block and zero inspiration   fun times   :"
"and all of the brothers and sisters said \amen!\"""""
"quick guys, hide your eggs!  jesus came back!"
"may or may not be losing the internet soon   i don't know when it will happen, but if i'm gone for a while, then you know why |c"
i have come to the conclusion that my neighbors are secretly pirates 
wow   life has kicked my ass this week 
one never truly realizes how much they need social interaction until they're cut off from it for several days on end  sad 
"no, negativity, go away "
"a little understanding and respect is all i ever want, but apparently that's just too much to e playful ect "
so how about that tact?  some people need to learn it 
fuck you friend faq   annoyed

"so, how about that there maturity?"
"\a friend accepts us as we are yet helps us to be what we should \"" -author unknown"""

"i have ac finally, but now my computer has an annoying virus   i just can't win at anything "
vampires do exist   they just feed off of willpower instead of blood 
"i should just tattoo \welcome home\"" to my forehead   """

"brb, destroying tokyo "
i don't know why i bother sometimes   
really wishes life would stop running her over

nice to know who my real friends are 
now i know what wallpaper feels like 
i hate feeling like i'm living in a box   
soooy <propfemale> perdedooorrr~ 
"i feel like that one lone kid at the playground that just hangs out on the swings, while all the other kids play     i don't like feeling like this "
happy halloween guys!  love 
"mood, where did you go?  you were doing so well   "

"important: the whole changing your profile picture to your favorite cartoon character thing was actually created by a group of pedophiles, because if children see pictures of cartoons they will add them   it was currently on the programmer internet frauds and will apparently be on tv some time   tonight   put this as your status to warn people and change your profile pictures back, thank you "
i get real sick of getting my hopes up for nothing 
"well, the furnace is completely dead and now we need to stay at my grandma's house, for who knows how long, due to shitty wiring in this damn house   life is aaaawwsoooome : |"
"well, the wiring is fixed now, so we can survive off of our space heaters again   we're getting a new furnace on monday  love "
i would like to thank my two co-workers that decided to quit and took away spending christmas with my family tomorrow   i hope you both fall in a fucking ditch 
"<propfemale> christmas guys, i love you all  love   love "
"tornadoes in december   what the fuck, missouri "
"brb, throwing people into the sun "
"no universe, i am not a virgo "
wish i didn't have to go into work today 
i am getting so sick of this house   why do things have to screw up when we can't do anything about it   
getting sick of this weather   among other things : \\
"i'm not going to say happy <propfirst>'s day, because this holiday is pointless   however, i will say that i love each and every one of my friends and family, even if a majority of you make me wanna scream and pull my hair out at times  love "
migraines are the shittiest things ever 
:  
"you know you're sick, when your sinuses are burning   thank you, weather "
"i'm fairly certain one of my job descriptions is not \babysitter\"" """

"apparently missouri didn't get the memo on how this is spring, not winter "
it's so nice to have my own wheels again
