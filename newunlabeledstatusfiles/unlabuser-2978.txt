"anyone can give up, it's the easiest thing in the world to do  but to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that's true strength "

"thats how hearts get broke, down in <propmale> hole   "
i can do it better than her!!!  wink 
"post this if your dad is a hard working man and is your hero, helps you no matter how bad you are or is just the best dad ever, if you are blessed to still have your dad or if he is an angel in heaven, paste this to your status and let everyone know you're proud of your dad, and that you love him dearly  you can replace a lot of people in life, but you only have one dad"
"haha, exactly the reason i dont trust men   "
why does he have to say all these things that make me go crazy?!?!?!

"a math tutor? really?! yes, i probably did score high on the math test haha but no i can not teach math to anyone  i just get it, idk how to e playful lain it"

"love doesn't exist and is not an emotion  it is a chemical and physiological process in the brain, reptilian brain (caudate nucleus) that causes the feeling of infatuation because of the release of pea molecules into the cns which in turn releases dopamine and hinders the release of seratonin  scientifically speaking  smile "
i miss my dad   
i'm so confused    idk what to do    and im debating a big decision which will probably hurt either way     sad 
"im not so sure he's the \one\""   """

"his love's like rain on a tin roof , sweet song of the summertime storm and oh the way that it moves you, it's a <propfemale> of passion raging on and then it's gone and just like a thirsty field, i can't complain or bitch 'cause i'm thankful for every single drop i can get     love   smile "

"people always say that girls look for guys who remind them of their dad, but if i look for a guy like my dad then no guy is ever gonna measure up cuz my dad is the best and no guy could ever even come close to comparing to him  most men only wish to be as great as he is  i love you dad!!!  smile "
"itâ€™s so weird and confusing that when i say i donâ€™t know what to do i really mean it  one minute youâ€™re making me laugh out loud like no other guy can, and the next i just want to get up and leave because you tick me off so much "
"<propfirst> <propmale>, <propfirst> nores, and <propfirst> karnow  smile   love "
"i've wasted nights waiting all alone wondering if you'd call, if you'd ever come home and so many tears that fell for you and all the heartache that you put me through so you can't break my heart anymore once we're through, thought you knew me but you don't and you can't have my love cuz it don't belong to you"
"ok  heres the deal  why do i not want to be in love? why do i not want to get married? 1- i dont need you, or anyone  i can take care of myself  i can support myself  2- i'm ok on my own  im not scared to be alone like 98% of everybody these days  3- love?, in this day and age is like the lochness monster  its an illusion  its a word thats just thrown around like nothing  love means nothing to many people anymore "
you can take the girl out of the country but you cant take the country out of the girl  smile 
"you and me boy we're one of life's little wonders, we go together like lightning and thunder, sky-high, on fire   feels good, don't it? thank your lucky stars, lucky's what we are  some people go through life never knowing what love is or where it's going, me and you boy we just walked up on it, feels good don't it     love   smile "

i only see this ending in disaster   
"i'm so paranoid of getting hurt  i am always getting my heart broken over and over  my heart has so many scars and bruises all over it  i don't know how much just one heart can take really, and i don't really want to find out either "
"in my wildest dreams, you always play the hero  in my darkest hour of night, you rescue me, you save my life   smile "
