it has come to my conclusion that the new generation has developed a highly effective emotional defense mechanism in which they can make a shield that allows them to buckle under this perfectly fucked up world that the previous generation has given them  e playful lains the sudden increase of ignorance and surrealism that is in the air  stupid people 
i finally finish training and everyones going back to school       hopefully i'll be able to do the same next year at colorado springs     goals are set
