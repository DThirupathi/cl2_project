trying to find a roommate    it's taking too long and i'm worried we won't find someone before july 1st     ugh
"relieved  finally found someone to take the room  i'm a bit worried about how the dogs will be since a pitbull can do more damage to strider than he could do to anyone    so i'm worried but at the same time i don't think it'll be bad, it'll be good (it's a feeling i get)     but yeah    "
i am taking interpersonal communication (3 credits) and biology (5 credits) this semester then next semester english (3 cr) and biology 2 (?cr)    then off to arapahoe for the real interesting mortuary science stuff  laugh  at this rate i'll be done w  school and have a career by like 23 or somethin    nice  laugh
