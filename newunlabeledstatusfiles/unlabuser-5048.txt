"chillaxin, had a pretty darn good weekend and already done with work this week  time to read my books "
i'm feeling really tired today 
"mentally preparing to spend the whole next week with my sister, the new baby and my other 2 nieces         "
"so facebook reminded me that i haven't logged in in awhile  *eye roll*  i've been sick since the beginning of the month, swine flu, almost all better now "
sulky cause i missed pretty much all of october (my fave month) and didn't get to partake in the activities i wanted 
enjoying november 
"i am officially only going grocery shopping at 1am on tuesday nights!  bleh, so many people out shopping every place we went today!"
figuring out xmas gifts            
"doing some online xmas shopping, goodbye money goodbye"
having a happy lazy bday   thanks for the hap-birt notes!   love 
*knocking on wood* cause i'm feeling damn good about life lately!
i realized today that i have not driven a car let alone my car in 2 1 2 months 
putting off digging through the storage closet to find my wrapping paper and bows   annoyed    must wrap tonight   
made some cookies!
"cleaning up a little, <propfemale> is coming in just a few days! fun!"
gonna pick up <propfemale> in the morning!! yay!  a visitor!
happy new years everyone! 2011 is coming up soon and it looks good to me   smile 
how's this happen? the one night it's acceptable for me to sleep until 10 or later and i wake up at 6am! guess i'm just excited for the new year   smile 
i do not get kidz bop at all  how is it appropriate if children sing adult songs? they're still adult songs  if you're gonna let them sing california gurls why not just turn on <propfemale> <propfirst>?
gar! apartment hunting has made my head hurt  i am soooo tired and i just get more tired thinking of having to pack everything and haul it to the new place       
"?(?????)? please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who is an idiot  idiots affect the lives of many  there is still no known cure for stupidity, but we can raise awareness        93% won't copy and paste this, will you make this your status for at least one hour?"
bored     
 sad   i hate when my <propfemale> has to go out of town overnight for work  it's lonely 
"go to urbandictionary com, type in your first name, copy and paste this as your status  put the first entry for your name under comments"
the weather outside is frightfuil              
i'm extremely <propfemale>der caffinated and starting to get a little stir crazy from being cooped <propfemale> indoors 
i miss the weekend        i like when my <propfemale> is home 
"ugh, packing is no fun, especially when it's items you rarely use but you just can't seem to let go of   excited for the new place though!"
"if you have a wonderful husband, fiancÃ© or boyfriend that works hard to provide for you and would do anything just for you and your family, then repost this as your status to give the honest well behaved men out there the recognition that they deserve  because great men are few and far between, and i have one of them ?"
all i want to do is absolutely nothing!
is it strange that i need childproof locks on my cabinets and closet doors so the cat can't open them?
"damn home depot, i was all excited because they had the vacuum filter i needed  so i go back to get it and it's gone! none left!  and i preemptively threw the old one out already "
"mmmmmm coffee, is that you calling my name? why, yes, yes it is!"
i would have rather just had a shot of patrÃ³n silver than this sencha shot! (japanese green tea) bleh 
"if you receive something that says 'send this to everyone you know',  pretend you don't know me  -<propfirst> <propmale>"
the one thing that makes easter <propfemale> trump halloween <propfemale> is: cadbury eggs    i could eat those all day! yum!
" sad   my car needed a new battery today  i guess i can't complain the battery that was in it was the original from when i bought the car, so lasting 8 years isn't so bad    i'm just sad, it's the first <propmale> thing i have had to do since the warranty ran out  what do i have to look forward to fixing next? *knocks on wood*"
"suck it home depot! i found my vacuum filter @ the grocery store, and it was cheaper!"
one moment can change everything  whether the moment feels significant  at the time or not  and then you're on this new path that's not part of  the plan  you can't control that it has happened you just have to go  along for the outcome  good or bad 
"i almost went bananas on some person cause i thought they stole my laundry basket! good thing i kept calm, i left the basket in the apt, not the laundry room   smile "
i know better than to have coffee after 9pm and yet i do it anyways  so here i am unable to sleep  my eyes want to sleep but everything else says no 
"soft <propfemale>, warm <propfemale>       little ball of fur       happy <propfemale>,  sleepy <propfemale>       purr, purr, purr"
"attn: <propfemale> area friends, my friend <propfemale> is looking for a sitter for tonight, and a sitter long term  if you're interested or know someone who is, please pass along your their name!    thanks!   <propfemale>- is anyone available to watch <propfemale> tonight from 2-10ish? looking for last minute babysitter!"
"weekend forecast:  looks busy w a <propmale> of crazy              hope everyone has an awesome easter weekend                       and if anyone finds themselves with more cadbury eggs than they know what to do with, well duh send them to me!!!   smile "

"ok i admit it i'm a bitch!!!! unfortunately most women won't repost this    i make mistakes, i'm out of control, i'm emotional, and at times i'm hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best! if you're a bitch repost this! i dare you!!!"
i should have just stayed in bed today! my eyes are barely staying open 
why is it that i can barely keep my eyes open during the day but i cannot fall asleep at night?  my internal clock is scrambled and cannot make up it's mind!
"yesterday i wanted to listen to some music during the afternoon to make some time go fast, by the time i was done making the playlist it had 220 songs, and no time to listne to it! it was time for dinner   smile   but it gave me something  to listen to today!"
"ok, time to try that sleep thing again!"
"i was inspired to get chinese food last night,  smile             my fortune cookie said: you are a lover of words someday you will write a book "

"wow, i actually slept good  i think it's because this financial aid headache is taken care of   smile "
rising with the sun is getting old fast      the fact that i've already been up for hours makes me not happy 
"mmmkay, ordered my new phone today  i was all set to go for the htc ozone, but after reading the reviews, and then rethinking what i'm really gonna do with my phone (pretty basic shite) i went with the kin two  and it was about $100 cheaper than the ozone or imagio (second choice)   we'll see how it goes  it comes tomorrow!"
shower time!!  such a lazy morning 
"wth, first as a kid you can't wait for school to let out for summer, but as an adult you scoop up all the summer classes you can  second, my summer classes are going to be harder than my fall classes  go figure "
