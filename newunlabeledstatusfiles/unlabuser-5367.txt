"when stuff blows up in your face you seriously have to wonder whats in store for the future, cause it better be worth all the chaos "
oh horrible days   how i hate you  could be worse though
"i hope everyone has an amazing holiday, i love you all and you are all in my thoughts "
you can judge the character of a person by how much they do for a person who can do nothing for them 
when life gives you lemons throw them at the ppl who pissed you off

it takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach  a human hair can hold 3kg  the length of a penis is 3 x the length of the thumb  the femur is as hard as concrete  a woman's heart beats faster then a man's  women blink 2 x as much as men  we use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand  a woman has read this entire    post  the man is still looking at his thumb  re post if this made you laugh 
"you will forever be in our hearts and thoughts  even though it has been a year now, feels like i saw you just yesterday  we miss you mox  rest in sweet peace <propfirst> dockery "
"he who speaks does not know, he who knows does not speak "
