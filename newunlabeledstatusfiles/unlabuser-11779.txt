"tired of crying, tired of hurting, when comes the time you pick up and move on and actually feel ok about     feels like never"
"throughout your life people move into and out of it  in one way or another each person helps you grow  some tear you down and force you to look deep within your self and give you strength, others show you how to stop thinking so deep and have fun  you become the people you <propfemale> with, so its good to have a balance of both     \ austin\"" 09"""
"true love isnt selfish  you work through the bad, take a few breathes, get thru the days one at a time  sure there are tears and hateful words and the outlook looks cloudy, but dont lose sight of your ultimate goal    only you can get there  give it your all and if for some reason it turns out not to be good enough, it wasnt meant to be "
"the only people who can really hurt you are the ones who matter most  eyes of innocence the face of an angel, the personalitly of a dreamer, and a smile that hides more pain than you can ever imagine  its hard to wait around for something you know may never happen, its even harder to give up when you know its everything you ever wanted "
is still not released to work but gonna attempt it anyway     gotta pay those surgery bills and school and groceries and life    geez
its hard to see what is right in front of you if you live with your eyes closed   and then you miss out on your future and all you ever wanted 
i want my life back    i want that place that i used to call home 
"<propfirst> wonder said it best     \i dont want to bore you with my troubles but there's somethin about your love that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet \""  i had a great day at clinicals and one day at a time has started good will day one """

"nothing lasts forever, so live it up, drink it down, laugh it off, avoid the bullshit, take chances, and never have regrets, because at one point everything you did was exactly what you wanted "
"ive made mistakes in my life, and let people take advantage of me and accepted way less than what i deserve  but ive learned from my bad choices and even tho there are some things i can never get back, and people who will never be sorry, ill know better next time and i wont settle for anything less than i deserve   love "

"if im not the one thing you cant stand to lose, if im not that arrow to the heart of you, if you dont get drunk on my kiss, if you think you can do better than this, then i guess we're done, lets not drag this on     consider me gone"
