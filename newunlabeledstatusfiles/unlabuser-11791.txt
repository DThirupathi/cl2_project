you know?  it's amusing when you try and eat pizza and you keep hitting your <propfemale>   yay for celebrating the new year and it's happiness to come 
"my betta fish saphira died yesterday (i bawled like a two year old and was depressed all day), our car is having transmission problems, and we are broke   bad day   god will take care of it "

"so, the bears are playing the patriots in light snow and fog conditions, while the pack is playing detroit in snow and fog   we shall see who will be  destroyed  may the pack be victorious!"
wow   there was actually some white flaky stuff covering the roof of our car when i went outside this morning   i now believe it is somewhat capable of snowing in southeastern north <propfemale>   and one of my co-workers said her door was frozen shut so what does she do?  she's an idiot and pours water on her door   people are so stupid down here 
"ya know?  people just dont't understand the concept of a turn <propfirst> in fayetteville   it just doesn't click   they turn their signal on (very few of them do), hit the breaks, and slow down to about 15 m p h  in a 50 m p h  zone, then just turn from the fast <propfirst>    what is so hard about it?  it doesn't kill brain cells idgits, not that you have any to worry about "
so glad my hubby's home   finally   i missed him so much!
"\now let's be men!\"" \",f0eaa42f76d1496710062b764b5a303f,"so, here's how rediculous north <propfemale> is   remember, dunlapians, when we hade six feet of snow on the ground, blizzard the night  before, and it was -20 below zero and we still had school?  yeah, in n c  if there's even a threat of winter weather, they close the schools down   there are flakes on the ground, not even barely covering the grass, it's raining, and school is closed   and part of ft  bragg too "
"hey all, as i'm sure you've read before, we've had some \bad weather\"" down here   earlier today pfc <propmale> was in a car accident and died after having emergency surgery   please pray for his wife and family as they are greiving """

"spent yesterday running errands   got a <propfemale> baked ham and filled the refriderator and freezer for 80 bucks, now have country style beef ribs in the crock pot for tonights supper   got to get ready for work   ew   retail sucks "
"well, the country style ribs were absolutely a flop   no flavor   must have been the grade of meat   on a brighter note, my husband bought me a small bottle of italian champaign to toast to our first christmas together "
"you know?  it amuses me to no end that i over hear my manager say that we're supposed to get two feet, yes, feet, of snow by sunday   i look up the forecast and it says 1 3 inches   <propfemale> christmas "
first christmas with my husband   it's wonderful

did i just hear that?  green bay packers spanked the giants and beat them 17 to 45?  whoooohoooooo!!!!!!
"i need to buy a blow dryer   not so i can dry  my hair, but so i can point it at my uterus to make these damn cramps go away   it'd be better than any heating pad "
what's on my mind?  my world has just been turned upside down in a whirl of confusion and hurt 
packers beat the bears and we are now in the playoffs   nothing further 
"hit the gym this morning for the first time in 3 months, then worked for 8 hours   ouch, my knees are killing me "
"so, as anyone who remotely knows me, i'm absolutely terrified of spiders   guess what was waiting for me outside the litter box as i went to go clean it?  a brown recluse!!!!! i hate north <propfemale>!!!!"
"so, a new friend of mine who has flatulence just as bad as me decided we were going to drink protien shakes   we backed out at the last second because the flavor was kinda narsty   we were going to gas the boys out of the house "
"ya know?  even though we may be having a rough patch, i still love my husband very dearly   not to mention he took me out to breakfast, cleaned the house, went grocery shopping, and has been giving me hugs galore today   he's awesome!"
"you know?  looking at other people's pictures i knew from high school makes me a little homesick   makes me wonder if i'm ever going to see any of my old friends again and <propfemale> out like old times   not that i had many times towards the end, and i regret that   i miss you guys "
"so, guess who woke up and opened the shades to find the entire road and parking lot covered in ice?  who found icecicles hanging off their car?  who has to leave an hour early to make a 20 minute commute to work? what state does not have salt trucks or snow plows?  come on, take a guess "
gel pens + fuzzy posters = awesome picture and two hours of entertainment 
"facebook is like obama ruining the constituiton   they force you to get the new profile, no matter how vehemently you say you don't want it "
"is super frustrated   i can't do anything right, now can i?  nah, that would be too much to do something correctly "
"wow, watching the boys do an interperative dance with imaginary glow sticks while they were drunk and i was sober to apney park is absolutely hilarious   wish i had a camera "
"the hurt and sadness is so deep within my bones   we all become the people who we say we're never going to be, do the things we say we're never going to do   we all lose the one person we love most, and the pain is more than i can handle   food is worthless, happiness is gone, and only a dark, bleak future awaits me   everything that i knew would always be there is gone "
