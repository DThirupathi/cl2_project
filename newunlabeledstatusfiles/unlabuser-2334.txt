"baby i sorely miss the vibrant gleam that's in your eyes; i don't want to talk about it    \\when you hear this chorus, do you miss the way the world was spinning towards us? \do you hurt the way that i do?\after all this time you leave me broken  \this song is every word i left unspoken  \when you hear this, girl, i'm hoping, that you'll think of us "
"the tragedy it seems i'm ending \i'm watching everyone i looked up to break and bending \we're taking shortcuts and false illusions just to come out the hero\well i can see behind the curtain \the wheels are cranking, turning\it's all wrong the way we're working \towards a goal that's none existent \it's none existent but we just keep believing "
"because i know  i'm good for something \i just haven't found it yet\but i need it       \\because these words were never easier for me to say\or her to second guess\but i guess\that i can live without you but\without you i'll be miserable at best"
i'm sunburnt now  sad  stupid hot weather  playful 
officially pissed off  people need to mind their own business or get the facts before flipping a bitch  especially people that don't even know me

"i'm sick and tired of you attitude \i'm feeling like i don't know you \you tell me that you love me\then push me down\and i need you like a heartbeat\but you know you've got a mean streak\it makes me run for cover when your around"
"there's a huge possibility that i won't be on facebook for the next 3 days because i'm being forced to go to poway and visit my dads parents who i've only met twice in my life!!! any who, poway is an hour away from where i'm staying and i'll be there for 3 days and then for sure after that i will be back on if anyone wants to talk  i'm pretty bummed about this but it's not like i have a choice "
