i would like to thank everyone for my birthday greetings 
it's the 2nd of june and it's cold 
i can't believe this   it's like the celtics just thought they were going to cruise through the game 
i'm trying not to lose my mind  minneapolis is just messed up  i don't know what is wrong with these kids today  my kids just lost another friend to nonsense  this is like the fifth or sixth friend in about as many months  i moved to the 'burbs to protect my children but i cannot protect them from this bull  right now i just feel lost 
the evo is the best phone i've ever had    so far
i know i'm bored when the bad girl's club is an interesting show 
it's too freaking hot   
i am sooo bored   i'm ready to go back home now
chillin with day family before i go back to minnesota 
on my way home   much luv to everyone and congrats again to <propfirst> and <propfirst> 
home at last 18 hours round trip   well something like that   much obliged to the law officials that were too busy to give out tickets  lol
i'm sick and tired of being sick tired   mystikal was the sh** 
hair battle spectacular   i still don't get it   can they please show something that actually look descent 
<propmale> <propfirst> drug kingpin in oakland died in the 80's over 3000 attended his funeral   huey p  <propmale> also died in the 80's not even 300
attended his funeral   it's bad when a community can praise and ultimately mourn a person that caused harm and ignore or belittle a person
that tries to uplift their community 
the one thing i dislike about getting older is that now i feel a couple of extra pounds   lol
until i get my new phone i've changed my mind about the sprint eco 
evo    damn phone corrects everything 
"the greatest thing in life is finding someone who knows all about you, your mistakes and regrets and yet they still find the best in you "
e playful ecting life to treat you well because you are a good person is like e playful ecting a bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian 
"you have three choices in life, give up, give in, or give it your all "
"sometimes you have to distance yourself to certain people not because you don't love them, it's because you have to move forward with your life "
sometimes we have to look back at ourselves and appreciate how our past shaped who we are as a person now 
"sometimes, what holds you together and what tears you apart are the same things "
i'm missing my kids like crazy right now   my heart is heavy but i'm happier than i've been in a while 
i've had the good and the bad  the good is ahead of me and the bad is behind me   gotta keep stepping forward 
"it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood, will you be mine, won't you be my neighbor   hi neighbor "
goodbye st  <propfirst>
this is the first time i've drove from minnesota to missouri and back without encountering rain   god is good 
have you ever done something then wished like hell you didn't?
a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out 
a turkey crossing the road is poultry in motion 
"never be afraid to try, remember amateurs built the ark   professionals built the titanic "
chillin wit my two boys whooping on them in monopoly
here's to you and here's to me; i hope we shall never disagree; and if that shall ever be   to hell to you and here's to me!
terrible snowstorm; below zero weather   guess i'm in for the weekend 
"i just realized that i have more enemies and frienemies than friends   damn, is it me?  naww it's just you, lhh "
"i belong to bridegrooms anonymous   whenever i feel like getting married, they send over a lady in a housecoat and haircurlers to burn my toast for me \-<propmale> <propfirst>-"
"in the book of life every <propfemale> has two sides: we human beings fill the one side with our plans, hopes and wishes; providence writes on the other side, and what it ordains is seldom our goal "
i am so sleepy!!!  stayed up most of the night trying to put my nephew to sleep   i'm on my second cup of coffee and the only thing that it's done was give me a stomach ache 
"i luv my nephew i really do, but how can a one year old take over your bed   i am seriously being held to a corner of my bed "
my legs are so sore   i totally need a boo right now to help ease the pain 
"if you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with \\-<propfirst> <propmale>-"
