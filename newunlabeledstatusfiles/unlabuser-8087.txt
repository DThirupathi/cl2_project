hmmm    i need head phones   so i can watch bones on my laptop    damn me for losing them  
i think i need something better to do than photo editing pictures  i just don't have the motivation to go get my book from the car  and other people's words are more facsinating than my own 
"hmmm, it's monday    what do i want to do today?"
"<propmale> is unhappy, crying and ready to go home  i'm ready to disappear into some episodes of bones  then some writing  then some reading  then some sleep  maybe not exactly in that order "
