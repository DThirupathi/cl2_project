"i finished reading paulo coehloâ€™s â€œveronica decides to die,â€� yesterday   i loved the <propfemale> and its softness about reality and what is insanity   the rumination that to dare to believe and think differently is often considered crazy for the society that sets the standard, just based on majority   structure has a way of creating a prison, and mundane routine becomes a poison that eats away at the soul "
"from the book, i draw two amazing quotes:  â€œwalk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things, god will bring thee to judgement â€� â€œbe like the fountain that overflows, not like the cistern that merely contains â€�"

"yet none could better know than i,\ how much of act at human hands\ the sense of human will demands\ by which we dare to live or die \ -a  tennyson"
"and dreams came around you in a hazy rain\you opened your mouth wide to feel them fall   -something corporate (old school)"
   
"i think i will go again today, to where the water flows and my mind finds its liberation    "
"i've destroyed the stars\taken back the images of constellations\and replaced them with delusions of lesser things\here no man is greater\i am no greater\this price is a high one\and it will rip me apart with time\i regret it now\regret that my stumbles through the wilderness\have led me here\there are no stars in the sky\now that they are fallin\no dreams when yours are breaking\only sorrow that flows from the deep "
i can only hope to make this better in time   
"\tell the truth even if it hurts   it will hurt me to \"" -punchline"""
"take your circumstance, piece by piece, day by day, and step by step "

so   my computer crashed
"what is this press upon me?\life should not be this difficult\when i know there once was a time"
"now that familiar glow of youth\is just a memory\and i can still feel the imprint \that it had left upon my heart\if this chaotic existence of work and supposed success\did not exist, i believe that we would, as men, \truly e playful erience some kind of renaissance\some kind of awaking of our souls\because we are starving\our time to reflect is chased away by obligation and necessity"
"as the veils become thin, the souls of the departed shall once again come to be amongst the living  let us know what it is to remember   have a great all hallows <propfemale> everyone"
