i am so tried but today was definitely god giving!
my feet got bit so bad at the beach!!!!
"who can say, \i have kept my heart pure; i am clean and without sin\""? proverbs 20:9"""

i just had to do the hardest thing   i had to say goodbye to the kids at la1  and the sad part is i didn't get to say goodbye to all of them  i wish they weren't so easy to love but that's not the case  to see there face light up when you come and then run into your arms is the best feeling in the world  to say that i am not heart broken right now would be lying  i am going to miss them so much 
"i wouldn't wanna be anybody else  you made me insecure  told me i wasnâ€™t good enough but who are you to judge, when youâ€™re a <propfemale> in the rough  iâ€™m sure you got some things, youâ€™d like to change about yourself  but when it comes to me  i wouldnâ€™t want to be anybody else!"

"my heart is definitely not here right now, but with my dad as he is building three house for some family's at la1  i pray everything goes well!"
i just havnt met you yet     or maybe i have???
"running is from the devil, but the results are from god  so its time to get my run on "
"oh, yeah, yeah \boys look so much hotter in the summer \yeah, yeah \take your shirt off in the water, pulled me under \oh, i must be dreaming \oh, you got me singing \yeah, yeah, yeah "
the smell of spring is such a great smell! i could literally lay in some nice comfy grass all day 
second day working at lost river today and i loved the first day! i hope no one feels like hugs though
