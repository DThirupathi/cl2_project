"how fast must a car, driven by an unlicensed driver, be moving in a parking lot to hit one parked suv hard enough to set it kinda on the bumper   kinda on the wheel of the truck it is parked next to?"
i need to hide out until after friday   that should be long enough   
fate has sent a warning shot this way   not happy   
"someone said everything happens for a reason    so the people we meet, the things we do   all become part of who we are until we reach where ever it is we are supposed to be in life   this is just a crazy road to be taking i guess   "
"while you scream at your woman, there's a manwishing he could whisper softly in her ear  while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding herhow wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your woman cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her  post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence ?"

"if your family has been touched and tormented by cancer (mine has)today is world cancer day - i'd appreciate it if you would post this request  93% won't repost it  a small request  just one line  dear god,i pray for a cure for cancer  amen"
now i remember why i usually don't drink      
i hate the feeling when someone is sick and you can not do anything to help them   
lack of sleep and too much time to think makes you go down paths you thought you put behind you   nice place to visit   but i must remember not to live there
