countin down the days to graduation    seems kind of sad that its almost over
only in michigan is it warm one day and snowing the next!
little late but happy kansas lost
if only life were a little more simpler  back to the days when school wasnt so stupid
"i want to be the one you run to, the one who isnâ€™t going to hurt you"
"i want to tell you my head is filled with things to say when you're here all those words, they seem to slip away"
bring on the vols  go state!!!
"you'll be thinking of me, somehow i will know someday when i'm lonely, wishing you weren't so far away, then i will remember things we said today "
go state!!!!!!!!!!!!!
spartans in the final four  go baylor!!!!!!!
marchin' to indy  goin for another national title  go spartans!!!!!!!!!
it matters not  who you love? where you love? why you love? when you love? or how you love? it matters only that you love 
"i think about you night and day, i need you and it's true  when i think about you, i can say, i'm never, never, never, never blue "
"i intend to live forever  so far, so good "
go state!!!!!! in like 4 hours
"when i see you i just dont know what to say, i'd like to be with you every hour of the day, so if you want me, just like i need you, you know what to do "
"if the rain comes they run and hide their heads  they might as well be dead  if the rain comes, if the rain comes "
laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live 
"love me while you can, before i'm a dead old man, a lifetime is so short, a new one can't be bought, but what you've got means such a lot to me"
all you need is love
"\what's the worst that can happen? a tidal wave? glaciers with guns?\"""""
"if the sun refused to shine, i would still be loving you  when mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me "
is in love with hawaiian punch
no guy is worth your tears & the ones who are wonâ€™t make you cry 
one of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that you can't say 
love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning 
"in order to be someone, you must first be yourself "
behind every successful man is a surprised woman 
you don't need anybody to tell you who you are or what you are 
"the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched, they must be felt with the heart "
love is not finding someone to live with  it is finding someone you canâ€™t live without 
"you really know you love someone when all you want is for them to be happy, even if that means that you are not a part of it "
"don't frown, because you never know when someone is falling in love with your smile "
"thank u johan franzen, thanks wings at least we didnt get swept"
what a terrible day outside  hate michigan right now
happy mothers day to all of the mothers in the world

"this is a smoke detector  \does that detect any type of smoke?"
"what is wrong with you? were you dropped on your head?\yes, i was  and up until now, everyone had the good grace not to mention it "
"hey, i'll go spy on them, i just gotta run home real quick and change into my ninja outfit "
"i see you got fat  \i see you still look like a fifteen year old girl, but not hot "
13 days  smile 
"if you love somebody, set them free  if they return, they were always yours  if they don't, they never were "
those who criticize our generation forget who raised it

"whenever i see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh  but then i think, what if i was an ant, and she fell on me  then it wouldn't seem quite so funny "
the road to success is always under construction 
"everything is funny, as long as it's happening to somebody else "
there's nothing more frightening then driving with a live goddamn cougar next to you
