this status is so <propfemale> will call me loser no more  smile 
it is only monday and i am looking forward to the weekend   i think that means i need a vacation 
hey saw the sun for a while today!  i don't know how those people that live up in alaska where it is dark for months at a time do it   i would be lopping heads in three weeks 
day one of not smoking!  i can already see that i am going to be white knuckling it all day 
here at the office on the weekend     trying to make sure i can take a few extra days off around memorial day!
why does extra spicy thai curry seem like such a good idea at 8pm on sunday but seem like such a bad idea at 2am monday 
here is my question:  why is there an inverse relationship between the technology to watch tv and the quality of tv to watch?  at this rate by the time i am 50 i will have the most awesome 3d hd dvr setup just to watch old gilligan's island reruns 
"since i was so ignorant about vt   i took it upon myself to look up a few things  annoyed \montpelier, vermont is the only u s  state capital without a mcdonalds \\strange town names in vt: bread loaf, island pond, mosquitoville, notown, moscow, underhill, satans kingdom, wilder\\until 1996, vt was the only state without a wal-mart\\women must obtain written permission from their husbands to wear false teeth "
after today!!  four straight days off   i need that  smile  
how come when i take a day off i feel like i was skipping school   i must be a huge narcissist because i feel nothing can run as well when i am not around  smile  
i think we should always get a three day weekend   i know i would vote for that 
big milestone   i now weigh in 30 lbs heavier   which is awesome since i have the same waist size   i have been in the gym nearly every day since feb 
is it me or has the summer movie season stunk this year 
"just got back from the gym   why is monday the busiest day at the gym   it is like a little microcosm of the year   monday huge number of people, tuesday a little less, weds is less than half of monday, thursday is pretty thin, and the weekend is empty    maybe i need to get a life since i am there to see this every week "
you mean it is only weds?
"ok - i am not getting a complex   in the last 3 months, 5 people have mistaken me for duke basketball coach <propfirst> k   it wouldn't be so bad, but i am a <propfemale> fan "
enjoying fun at the beach
it's hot!! how hot? dayum hot!!
i was just sitting here admiring my rug   it really ties the room together 
i just heard on the radio coming in that it will only be 88 on tuesday   brrrrrrr!!
"most days i can't wait to get to the gym and then there are days like today where i have to make myself go   i have found if you want to be serious about it those are the days it is important to go \\but it is like they say:  somedays you eat the bear and somedays the bear eats you "
i am tired   can i just skip ahead to friday?
and end the end the love you take is equal to the love you make!  (best lyric ever)
"went an saw dinner for schmucks, and it was great   i love a good comedy and i laughed so hard that my chest hurt by the end of the movie   great comedy is like a great magic trick; you know it is an illusion but you just can't look away "
"a top 10 quote: the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows  i don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it  you, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life  but it ain't about how hard ya hit  it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward  how much you can take and keep moving forward  that's how winning is done!"
a 300lb naked fat man nearly fell on me today in the gym locker room  why do old guys feel the need for total nudity in the locker room anyway? on a happy note i found that in that situation i can move with the speed of a cheetah!

"man is fond of counting his troubles, but he does not count his joys   if he counted them up as he ought to, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it   ~fyodor dostoevsky"
somewhere out there - right now! there is a cold beer with my name on it  smile 
one of the most surreal aspects of getting older is the realization of how much you didn't know when you were younger 
"sorry, haven't posted in a while (<propfemale> and <propfemale> pointed this out to me   thanks for missing me guys   are you missing the warmer climate yet?"
"if i wanted to have snow every weekend in december,  i would still be living in new york "
i do love asian food    just had some excellent thai   now i just need to find a good vietnamese restaurant and my circle will be complete  smile  
"ok - i am taking <propfemale>'s challenge\\let's see how creative my face book friends are     leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name     it can only be 1 word     then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you    "
i hate being stuck at home    hate it!!  i like working at work   i like seeing people and i hate daytime tv   i will be at work tomorrow even if i have to walk 
ohh the weekend   i am going to do something i have not done in a long time   cook something   i promised someone so now i got to deliver 
"ok   first i forgot to take a picture of the finished product   however, i did complete the project   i was very spicy which was good for me   i had some troubles but fought through them   i think it was ok   my sister and brother in law had some and they were kind with their words   of course they could just be making me feel good about the attempt   smile "
i just had a really good day   i mean it   i got a lot done at work   had a fun time and a fun lunch   i was able to give someone a helping hand   now i am enjoying a cool refreshing beer 
woke up this morning and thought it was a work day   i ran on auto pilot all the way up to the shower when i finally realized it was saturday 
i am just happy today   in fact i am so happy it is a little scary because that must mean something is up  smile  
"at the office on a saturday    why are offices so spooky when no one else is there   it creaks and moans like i am sailing on a pirate ship or something   people write songs about working for the weekend, but nobody writes a song about working on the weekend!"
"working again on weekend   tired today, but it is a good tired  i think it is time for a nap and then more work "
going to work on superbowl sunday   trying to pick what should be my motto for the day;  all work and no play makes <propmale> a dull boy or a man has to put business ahead of pleasure 
to my facebook friends:  if any of you know any java developers that are looking for a position in the rtp area drop me a line 
"i am now \cautiously optimistic\""    smile """
finally!!  the project is coming to an end!  i shall soon have a weekend again!  in the words of braveheart - f r e e d o m !!!
the new product rolled out last night!  i got up today and have no plans on working!  what am i going to do with myself?  what do people do with free time?  i have forgotten   i am actually making plans for next weekend    smile
