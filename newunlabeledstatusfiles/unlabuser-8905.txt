"the <propfemale> of friendship is not the outstretched hand, nor the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him with friendship"

"imagine a dihydrogen oxide, a compound that has no taste or smell is so diverse in its properties that its generally benign, but lethal at others  depending on its state it can scald or freeze you  in the presence of certain molecules it forms carbonic acid that can strip faces off statues  when agitated it can strike with fury that no human edifice can withstand  those who've learned to live with it call it water "
there is no such thing as a scary movie anymore  they're all so hilarious nowadays!

when you're going through hell it's hardly a good time to stop walking 
"if you call my name out loud\do you suppose that i would come running\do you suppose i'd come at all\i suppose i would\and if i was gone from the land we know\would be the dawn\and let your beauty still show\and if you were walking \and heard the cold night coming\would you call my name\'cause you know i'd come running"
keep your eye on the invisible 
the sand needs to fall faster through the hour glass
