really really bored
stick your hand into my back pocket light me up like a bottle rocket i just wanna free fall for a while
eating sup
just spent an awesome day and a half with some relatives i just met
"\how am i supposed to feel about the things i've done? i don't know if i should stay or turn around and run\"""""
"\shackled\"" by vertical horizon    song of my life"""
im back in south <propfemale> after 3 wks in montana
about 19 hours home and im already having a crappy time
"singing amen i, i'm alive singing amen i, i'm alive if everyone cared and nobody cried, if everyone loved and nobody lied, if everyone shared and swallowed their pride, we'd see the day, when nobody died"
the tick tock of the clock is painful  all sane and logical  i wanna tear it off the wall
i would swallow my pride  i would choke on the rhines  but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside  i would swallow my doubt  turn it inside out  find nothing but faith in nothing
i burn burn like a wicker cabinet  chalk white and oh so frail  i see our time had gotten stale
i wish my sister would just mind her own business and stop trying to get me in trouble
wondering why i e playful ress my emotions thoughts feelings except to my closest friends    it never ends very well
facebook gets boring if u spend all ur time on it
this chat is really making me mad
why is life so confuzing and complicated
"i'm not a perfect person  there are many things i wish i didnt do  but i continue learning  i never meant to do those things to you   and so i have to say before i go, that i just want you to know  i've found a reason for me, to change who i used to be  a reason to start over new, and the reason is you"
i sit here locked inside my head  remembering everything you've said  the silence get's us no where  get's us no where way too fast  the silence  is what kills me  i need someone  here to help me  but you don't know  how to listen  and let me make  my decisions
had alot of fun ith my all state choir friends today      
"is wishing his closest friend would grow up, accept that life sucks at times, and realize that his isnt that bad"
