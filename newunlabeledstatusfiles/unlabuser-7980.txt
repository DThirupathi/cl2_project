don't criticize what you can't understand
"last night, i had a dream we were inseparably entwined like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine held together, holding each other with no one else in mind like two atoms in a molecule inseparably combined"
â€œtension is who you think you should be   relaxation is  who you are â€�
today was odd   workout bed then zoo tomarrow!
do you need anybody? i just need someone to love  could it be anybody? i want somebody to love
what dose a space ranger actually do ?
"don't underestimate the value of doing nothing, of just  going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not  bothering "
â€œlife  goes on within you and without youâ€�
try to realize it's all within yourself n surprise ne else can make you change
f i could start again a million <propmale> away i would keep myself i would find a way
everyone i know goes away in the end
"â€œwhen i was a child i caught a fleeting glimpse out  of the corner of my eye i turned to look but it was gone i  cannot put my finger on it now the child is grown, the dream is  gone  i have become comfortably numb â€�"
"you are young and life is long and there is time to  kill today  and then one day you find ten years have got behind you   no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun"
"a true friend is someone  who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to  feel  or, not feel  whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is  fine with them  that's what real love amounts to - letting a person be  what he really is "
slow down! you move too fast
â€œif you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes  you'll just have to claw your way through this disguiseâ€�
â€œbe  who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter  and those who matter don't mind â€�
"got a good reason,        for taking the easy way out\day tripper, yeah!"
"all you \touch and all you see is all your life will ever be "
"please don't spoil my day \\i'm <propmale> away \\and after all \\i'm only sleeping"
"and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking \\              racing around to come up behind you again \\              the sun is the same in a relative way but you're older \\              shorter of breath and one day closer to death "
"â€œbe\ who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter \and those who matter don't mind â€�"
