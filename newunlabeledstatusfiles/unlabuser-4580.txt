i am sorry but i will not accept any friends request from anyone in indiana  i will never get over <propfemale>'s death & the way that you people treated her before she died  i am not as forgiving as the rest of my family  nor will i forget all the stuff & money that <propfemale> stole from me when she left my house the last time i saw my <propfemale>  i don't need people like that in my life  this isn't meant for is <propfemale> 
we have all of our kids with us tonight! you know raychael and <propmale> are so happy  fixing to watch the new night at the museum 2  good family night 
why did all my quizzes say i am crazy?! i used to be but my life is so perfect since i found <propfirst> i have no reason to be  but i guess over my son i still am  we all know what i am talking about 
putting my man on the bus and going to get all this damn running around done   <propfirst> isn't having a good day  hope it gets better and he comes home  his family will make it better we always do  start new classes next tues !

daddys home early!!!! gonna be a good day! <propmale> is playing hooky (in 4k) lol and we are going to his brother's and working in his garden  just enjoying our wonderful life!!
"i can't wait to finish school so we won't have it so tight  yeah we live in a very nice brick house in a nice location with alot of land & we have some basic nice things, bust just by the skin of our teeth  i can't wait til the day i don't have to tell any of my kids they can't have something they want  my schooling is to make my kids life easier "
thinking about my brother  hoping he is doing ok inside and praying that everything goes okay for his baby girl  he & <propfemale> is the best thing for her  he is too good of a father to lose her because her so called mother is a fuck up! i love you <propfirst>!
i am so proud of <propmale>! he went up on all 3 parts of his map test! still in the gifted classes and doing wonderful at quarterback practice! everyone says i am one of the best mother's ever but i guess the proof is in your children & mine are proving it true  hope we are making you proud lexi 
just got my little red netbook! i love this thing! i will never use a regular laptop or computer again  i could fit this thing in my purse if i carried one  lol
just drove all 3 kids to walgreens to get silly banz!! every person in line was buyng them  when i went in i asked the clerk where they were and a customer answered  what is up with this obsession  even raychael had to have some!
"for someone who thinks u should stop having babies if u can't afford the ones u have, well sorry i wanted a girl so bad & haven't had 3 abortions! stop having kids if u don't want to pay child support! i do just fine supporting my own  more than i can say for someone!"
sorry about the negativity fb  i just saw something posted about me and had to get that off my chest  everyone knows i take care of my kids very well and almost half way thru with my ba 
"okay, gonna forget about what i read last night on here  like <propfemale>'s friend said yesterday, people just don't like to see other people happy  sorry but i am not going to let those 2 upset me  my kids are the best thing that has ever happened to me! god gives them to us for a reason! (and it's not to kill them) <propmale> sees who gives everything they have for him  actions speak louder than words!"
"before your kids leave for school today, or if they are younger, or if you don't read this before they go, as soon as you read this, hug them and tell them you love them  i know astions speak louder than words but you can never tell them enough how much they mean to you  sometimes it jsut makes them feel good to hear it!"
lovin' life and lovin' my family! just enjoying the day with my kids until my perfect <propfirst> gets home  going to study some before my quiz sunday  wish everyone could be as happy as me!
"just thought i would say bye to the facebook world before i delete my profile  some certain people won't leave me alone and keep finding ways to get on my <propfemale>  so like he ruins everything else, he has ruined this for me too "
you can write you're own life but remember to use a pencil and give god the eraser
"i always thought that i would have so much to teach my child, but i find that it is my child who has taught me "
"getting <propmale> up fot school than cleaning my floors and going back to bed for a while  zahary is out of school now and <propmale> still has a wk! i will go crazy without him here to help  they love him so much, i can get my stuff done cause they stay stuck up his butt "

"thanks for putting that pic of <propmale> on my <propfemale> since you knew i wouldn't  but from his #1 fan, tht doesn't look <propmale> <propmale>  this coming from someone who never misses one game and has probably since every pic he's ever been in  can tell by the back of his head  lol"
