today was an ordinary day until the coyote decided to test everyone   i wonder how i scored 
some days it feels like the progress of big business and government seems like its too much until they cross paths and cause a pileup to stop the progress   i'm glad the snwa pipeline was delayed by the <propfemale> high court   =-)
"today is a good day   things are getting done, but all i can think about is a nap    smile "
"just chilling here at work, not in a very good mood   i can't believe i don't have the respect of one of my best friends "
today is a much better day   glad i was able to talk things out a little 
"it seems like whenever you really need to talk to someone, they are never around "
just another day   don't know what i'm going to do this weekend though   had time to think about what happened the last few days and i am still not sure if i want to be social 
well i can tell you all one thing     i will never truly understand some things 
i now understand the value of a walk in the morning   gives me time to greet the morning sun and helps me clear my mind and free myself from any negativity that may be out there 
let's see how forthcoming my facebook friends are  leave a one-word comment that you think best describes me using the third letter of your name  it can only be one word  no more than one word  then copy and paste this post on your wall so i can leave a word about you 
another day
i hope everyone has a safe st  patricks day   i know that i'm going to be safe just chillin at home letting my thoughts run wild 
"is tired of trying to communicate with people that are like walls     you can say whatever you want to them, but you're basically talking to yourself   but at least i know now "
the frybread man can!!!!!!!
maybe today will be looking up 
isn't work supposed to take your mind of things?
"prayer works in mysterious ways     i was praying on something today and i asked for a sign, i know everything will be good because when i asked for that sign 3 hawks started screaming above me and two landed in front of me and looked me in the eyes then flew off "
"i know i can accomplish anything, as long as i keep my head right "
just another day     looking forward to tomorrow   i wonder if my dad will make up some frybread
"alright, i'm outta here   i hope everyone has a great day "
its kinda funny     i'm not really full of joy today   maybe when i get off work it'll be different 
when you need someone around    they never seem to be   i just hope i'm not one of those people to someone else 
feeling alright today   had fun on my birthday 
"drama    when it rains it pours   i'm just glad that i'm not the cause of it, i just happened to be standing close enough to get pulled into it "
is up and ready to go meet the big bosses over at the epa building here in san <propfirst>      i hope today goes well 
ahhh    another day done   can't wait for the phone call later   i love the people in my life    smile 
"today is going to be a great day   the sun is shining, my thoughts are good, and its one day closer to next thursday "
the weather always seems to be changing for the worse here     at least i got good thoughts in my head even though i'm being told not to    smile 
man what a night   i have no idea what to say about that one except i don't know why everyone was hating on me 
i don't know what is going to be of me this next week

"alright, one day closer to the weekend where i can cook up some mad baked ziti  wink "
i wish this <propfemale> thing would kick in     i'm tired of doing good things and then i get the bad end of the deal   while the ones who are bad get everything handed to them       i think <propfemale> is a lost cause

"sometimes wonders what would be if i lived somewhere else      i'm thinking it'd probably be about the same, just a different place and different people    wink "
nobody knows you       when your down and out     
getting ready for my community outreach tomorrow    yeah!!!!!!!!!
"people need to understand that children with special needs are not sick  they are not searching for a cure, just acceptance  this week is for special needs education  ninety three percent of the people will not copy and paste this  will you be part of the seven percent that will and will you leave it on your wall for at least an hour??"

this new year is already like a roller coaster ride     
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, being bitchy, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they left off, even if it has been months ( or even years) apart  they love you for who you are  re-post if you have at least one true friend  they will know who they are"
