"i believe, in the end, what's most important to me is the knowing  i don't really give a shit if i'm wrong or right, i just want to know the truth  to see past all the lies, all the illusions, the misdirections and evasions, and know, not just guess  guessing is beginning to wear thin "
"eventually, i'll stop being diplomatic and start dropping facts and the \things i do know, and people will be cornered and defensive and \aggressive   but i bet they'll stop underestimating me  maybe they'll \just come out and be honest  but probably not  meh "
"the problem i see with the honesty i seek is that most of the time people cannot be honest with themselves  i cannot rightfully e playful ect them to be honest with me when they aren't even aware that they're decieving themselves  but i can hope, right?"
"perception  a person's perception determines their reality  i don't know why i occasionally forget this, it never fails to cause me endless trouble when i do, and it's one of my fundamental beliefs! to summarize the chain of thought: those you love will probably never love you the way you love them, for one simple reason: their reality is different, thus their definition of love is different "
do not pretend conclusions are certain that are not demonstrated or demonstrable 
"should you always do what you want to do? no  should you always do what you need to do? yes  should you always do what you are forced to do? ha! gotcha! no one can ever force you to do something  in the end, you always have a choice: to do or not do that which you need want feel   "
\when the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with\f61f89ffbb4fb21ba2561ec65f70a79d,i wish i could remember how to fly 
"okay  update on my day  everything just got super funny  i just spilled the entire box of fucking cherios, and i can't stop giggling! wheee!"
don't feel too good  coming down off of the giggles i think  suckage 
can't sleep  stupid brain 
"zomg! fucking dishes were fucking disgusting  rotten chicken fat, vegetables, and ramen anyone?"
"so it continues  the sfb has hopped gelatinous upon the mass effect train just to do it, even though her room smells like a pile of mayonnaise and dirty diapers that's been out in the sun for a few weeks, the sink is overflowing with dirty dishes, the kids were fed applesauce snack cups for breakfast, their laundry still hasn't been folded   "
"i feel like i woke up in filth hell right now, and sloth and gluttony's \reeking lust-child is mouth breathing while playing mass effect on the \stinky couch "
"i wish heaven had a telephone so i could hear your voice again  i thought of you today, but that is nothing new  i thought of you yesterday and days before that too  i think of you in silence, i often speak your name  all i have are memories and a picture in a frame  your memory is a keepsake with which i'll never part  god has you in his arms, i have you in my heart  ~repost if you love someone in heaven~"
people who use pity as a weapon are more than pathetic; they are contemptible 
"fatloser is reeking on the couch, kids are zoning (and i do mean zoning) at their respective hand-held video game players, tannis hadn't had his pill, she'd in the middle of talking to her friend on xbox live, slurring her words   maybe she's having a stroke  well, i can hope!"
"one of my biggest pet-peeves is how people will prove something that they constantly deny, and yet you know that if you say something about it, they'll just deny it again, or worse, make up some lame excuse  i am so done with today "
"why tempt fate? sorry everyone, i'm not superstitious, but this year october has 5 fridays, 5 saturdays and 5 sundays  this happens once every 823 years  this is money bags  so copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days  based on chinese feng shui  the one    who     does not copy, will be without money  i cannot let that person be    me    copy within 11 <propfemale>  good luck"
"i finally understand how painful love can be, how hopeless and lost it can make you feel when it's not returned the way you want it to be  i know love is complicated, and i try to have faith in my belief that true love will never, ever be a bad thing  i finally understand   and i wish to god i didn't "
"why\was i born with this? why do i have to <propfemale> the burden of it? i donâ€™t want it \i never have  all my life i have wished things were different  all my life i\have wished i was born different, that i had something that would make me whole "
"but\i donâ€™t, and i never will  i have been ostracized, hurt, punished,\pushed-aside, violatedâ€¦all because of an accident of birth  all because i am\not what i am, but because i have something than no one will see past "
"i\should never have been made to feel the hatred and disgust that i feel towards\myself, but i have and i do  it hurts so much more when someone you love has\said that they can and will love you regardless, and you believe them, and you\are loyal and trustingâ€¦and they betray you and change their mind, deciding that\they cannot accept you "
"it\hurts even more when they say they still accept you, but everything else that\they do, whether behind your back or in front of your face, says loudly and\clearly that they are rejecting you  understand: this isnâ€™t something they\should be judged or condemned for  they are only human, and i will not condemn someone for the frailties that i myself bear "
[poke] me if you ever had a crush on me or still do   [like] this status if you think i am a good friend   [message] me if u ever wanted a relationship with me   i wont tell anyone   [comment] on this if we have had good memories   now let's see who's brave enough to copy this and put on their status! i was brave enough!! are you?
"never in my life have i wished to see behind the veil to what lies beyond  never in my life have i ever wanted anything but a peaceful mind  i didnâ€™t ask for this, but i am punished for it none-the-less  i am hated and feared when i use it, and i am laughed at and underestimated and objectified when i donâ€™t  i am so tired of knowing, but it is a part of me, and i canâ€™t bury it "
"i intensly dislike being ambivalent, especially towards people "
it's a terrible thing to find out that you do not cannot live up to the e playful ectations of someone you love;  it is even worse when you find out that you do not cannot live up to the e playful ectations you have of yourself 
"wow, so i have no idea what happened, but apparently someone's bubble got busted, 'cause now she's even more irritable!  can a videogame really be that important?!?"
"there are three key aspects of what makes a friend a friend: caring (to be concerned or solicitous; have though or regard), respect (esteem for, or a sense of the worth or excellence of a person, a personal quality or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal ability or quality), and devotion (<propmale> attachment to a cause, person, etc ) "
"fair-weather friend: one who is friendly, helpful, or available only when it is advantageous or convenient to be so   if you are only willing to devote time and effort to you friends when you need something or don't have anything else you'd rather do, guess what?  you're one of these "
