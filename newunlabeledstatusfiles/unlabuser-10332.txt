"\i never want to be so far from god that i don't hear his spirit convicting me \""  a direct quote from a wonderful conversation i had with a dear sister in christ this morning   what do those who only wish to feel good about themselves do with the convicting power of the holy spirit?  i feel so sad when i think about the answers that are possible to this question """

"as the week began i find myself convicted to live a devoted, surrendered, sacrificial life for the lord   what are you devoted to?  whose will do you surrender to?  what do you sacrifice your time, effort, and finances to?  in answer to these questions   lord, let it be you!  i do not want to be half-hearted, not willing to commit   i want to consider and be willing to pay the cost        for you and you alone lord "

"if it lines up with and is supported by the word of the one true god, if it challenges you and changes you, then is it not the will of god? are we to exercise our spirits on a treadmill never getting more then one foot in front of the other? come on all you fellow believers, let's put on our hikers and follow where the lord leads  i'm certain the destination will be worth the journey "
"do i have the courage to really implement all that the lord speaks to me?  it seems so easy when he and i talk in private, why would any one reject love so freely given with out reservation and no <propfemale> for any thing more than love in return and the best life has to give?  then i remember how the world, religious leaders, and even those in his inner most circle treated him   again, am i brave enough?"
"when we begin to recognize and admit all of our sin and the nature of god's forgiveness and grace, only then we will stand in awe of each believer's testimony   i give thanks for every breath i have been given today as the miracle from god that it truly is "

"from my bible study this morning   question: god's love is unconditional?  answer: no; it is absolute and his acceptance has the condition of faith   when we tell ourselves others that god loves them, it is true, but to say it is unconditional is to point them to a god of love alone and not the jealous god that demands our faith and obedience  example: lot's family wife   what do you think?"
