"things i learned today : 1)  the first phones didn't utilize keypads   2)  when you're thinking about how bad you want to eat deviled eggs, nothing else will satisfy you   3)  back in the day, you could travel 200 <propmale> on one tank of gas   that cost 3 dollars  uphill   in the snow "

"things i learned today: 1)  drinking a 5 hour energy shot makes time move like the speed of light   it also makes the brain malfunction   2)  the best way to show someone your love is by buying them shoe polish   3)  when a group of teenagers buy 8 cartons of eggs, they aren't up to no good   they're just making a really big omelet "
