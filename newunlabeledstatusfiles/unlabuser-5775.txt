"i can;t believe that people still believe in astrology after the advent of astronomy  astrology at it's core relied on one concept, that the earth is the center of the universe  after it was discovered that the earth isn't even the center of the entire universe, our galaxy, or even the solar system astrology should have died out  it's mind blowing what people will believe "

"my view of the constitution: the us constitution is meant to protect the individual from the majority  nowadays politics in <propfemale> is dominated by populism, the idea that the majority opinion is the correct opinion - i see this as mob rule  each person is equal in the eyes of the law, the law is blind  a democracy depends on the feelings of human beings - unequal, clouded by opinion "

i bought a pouch of american spirit perique blend tobacco yesterday at a tobacco shop  it's a great smoking tobacco  i recommend it above all other rolling tobaccos i've come across thus far 
modern life is boring  there isn't anything left to e playful lore  it's too bad that long distance space e playful loration isn't practical 
i occasionally think about what it would be like to take a human life but then i remember '25-to-life with without the possibility of parole' depending on whether or not they can prove it was premeditated 
all drugs should be legal  people assume that they have the right to protect people from themselves  people are going to use drugs  drugs are never going away  the drug war is a losing battle  we clearly haven't learned our lesson after alcohol prohibition  when criminals control an enterprise there are violent consequences  the drug war hurts us more than it helps us 
"if you've taken the time to watch the news lately    by lately i mean anytime in the last decade the quality of news programs have taken a nose dive i can't stand to watch this inane bullshit that passes for news  cnn is about as informative as people magazine, fox news is a right-wing propaganda machine, and msnbc is a left-wing fox news  call me an idealist but news shouldn't be opinionated "

"i can't think of one instance where loyalty to others has served to make my life better  it is in these failures that i have learned that being self-serving is not a bad thing  people are extraneous and regardless of what you believe you always choose yourself over others  even when you choose others you are choosing yourself  simplify the equation, look out for #1 "
i look at my increasing cynicism and bitterness as a positive  nothing i've done thus far has benefited me  i think that being contented with my miserable excuse for an existence would be a mistake on my part  being content with a miserable situation would be stupid  i prefer misery to stupidity
