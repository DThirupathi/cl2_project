ere long i should have a si playful ack  thank goodness for wii fit!
"what i want in life annoyed some peace and quiet once in awhile\a wife who can deal with all my shit\a baloney sandwich\a grand piano\to raise my kids in a pacifistic manner\a bubble bath\and a really big beard"
ain't no way i'd rather be 
i never knew it was easy as closing my eyes
"i think life is a lot like tetris    the same thing happens over and over, so you become familiar and learn how to deal with 'em  but eventually all these problems pile up and they come faster and faster    and then you lose "
going to the girlfriend's house here in awhile!
"4564- i know we don't have the most ordinary form of communication, mainly through hugs and laughing our asses off  but this is mainly what matters the most  i like the fact that we can share music together and i don't see why our friendship couldn't continue long into the future  i'm quite comfortable around you "
666- what's goin' on?! i really do admire your ability to focus when everybody else is goofing off  i'm glad you could help e playful and my knowledge of 8-bit music! i'd also say you have a good <propmale> of being drum <propmale> 
"17 9- i miss you  but i'll happily call you my first ever girlfriend because i've learned so much from you, if not by being with you than all the talks we've had thereafter  i'm glad you can accept my quirks and insecurities "
"1111- i don't know much about you, but i'd say that you seem to be more reserved in situations you're not familiar with  i admire the way you conduct yourself around others and your devotion to your boyfriend  all in all you seem to be mysterious, and a curious person to talk with "
it's good to be home 
in the best of moods! sledding later possibly 
i have successfully kicked this day's ass 
finally got new contacts! no more dyslexia!!! win
"i saw the sun sinking below the horizon\when darkness comes, i know i'll be ready to shine\and on that day, breathe and taste the air\it surrounds us, let us smile and suffocate\but here, where everything is beautiful\eyes are closed and shadows illuminate\i will forgive my regretful times\so i know i'll have another <propmale> to shine"

"so, drumline practices this week  i was wondering if anyone would be interested in giving me a ride? just lemme know , alright?"

"36x, that's us "
what a wonderful day!
an awesome first day back in school if i do say so 
looks like i'm gonna make it after all 
"tick-tock goes the clock\these moments are wasting by\abandon thoughts of armageddon\the fun is only beginning"
i wish i were an ice cube 
"if only i could stretch\beyond the prison of flesh and bone\i could touch the sky\and see things yet unknown\ooh, if only i were high enough,\i could grab the stars\and bring some down for us\just for us and the way we are"
"for hypothetical intent annoyed let's just remember all the times they've told us not to be afraid to be ourselves  then let us also remember the confusion when we are punished for taking their words too literally  so what is right and wrong? it's definitely a matter of perspective, i'd say "
"the notes, after all, are not where the truth in music lies  music is in the communication between the notes "
"hatred is a waste of energy, i suppose it's healthier to just not care anymore "
"if i kiss you where it hurts, would you feel better?"

"i see, a bad <propfemale> rising   \i see trouble on the way \don't go out tonight,\'cause it's bound to take your life \there's a bad <propfemale> on the rise "
"a good morning so far! let's see how to screw it up again, haha "
"so, forget about the puppy i guess  i mean, i thought she was sweet and everything but according too my aunt that doesn't compensate for her having some health problems  hmm  i see a recurrent theme here  should people be given back as well, just because they're not \perfect\""?"""
higher branches equals more wicked roots 
you are my sweetest downfall

"one by one the stars burn out\as i stand resolute, and silently shout\i watch and i wait\and hope it's not too late"
"aren't we all just balloons? subject to inflation and deflation alike? a constant battle to keep afloat? too much pressure, and we pop  none at all, we flop  i just wanna float, no strings attached, so i can perchance come upon a new horizon sometime within my lifetime "
what if we're no better than the clothes that wear us?
"all i can say is, what a great day  thanks mother nature "

"i will light the match this morning so i won't be alone \watch as she lays silent, for soon that will be gone \i will stand arms outstretched, pretend i'm free to roam \i will make my way through one more day in hell "
this is exactly what we needed from the start 
"rain, come down, and fall forever\drain, the dirt, into the wasteland\pray, for sound, to quiet the howling\\feel, no shame, too brave\feel, afraid, to wait forever\\kneel, to fade, the day's corrosion\crawl, depart, towards perdition\gray, the part, the bruise within you\\feel, no shame, too brave\feel, afraid, to wait forever\\forever\\feel, no shame, too brave\feel, afraid, to wait forever"
"sometimes you have to confront your own patterns and e playful ectations of yourself and do away with things that you enjoy doing in order to move forward and keep evolving as a musician  that's exactly the definition of the word progressive of course \\â€œâ€�steven <propmale>"
what a lovely evening!

"it's quite amusing when people denounce your suggestions or ignore them altogether  then they become angry when the next suggestion is less of a compromise, so they propose their own idea (albeit strikingly similar to yout original proposition) and take all the credit for it \a k a  the joys of stubborness and miscommunication "
"holy mother of the simple one,\when you smile at me you bring me down,\you betray your thoughts \all your prayers too low \\now out of debt, you speak in tongues,\and out of bread, your work is done,\and your dream, absolve \and your path, dissolve \\and your dream, absolve,\and your path, dissolve "
"look not through my eyes as you would your own\speak as though it is all you have ever known   "
"i've realized that the abilities of an artist are not in the eyes of the painter, nor the ears of the musician, nor the mere cognition of the casual philosopher; they are found in the individual's open attitude towards the world around them and their ability to receive the unknown  the ability to receive an orphan into their own as if they had been living there from the start \~p t "

"maybe i won't be the one to say, \i told you so \"""""
"when you smile at me, you bring me down "
what sweet seduction lies before us?
if you could go back in time

"when the bells ring, they'll all come to see\there's a fire in the fields, a killer in the village\when the bells ring out tonight for my change of heart"
you can't see this beauty through someone else's eyes 
time is all we have to lose

i'll wait for you 'til my stars start falling 
tu ne sais rien d'amour 
this is where the sidewalk ends   
"hold on to the thread\the currents will shift\glide me towards   \you know something's left\and we're all allowed\to dream of the next\oh, ohh the next, time we touch   "
"come on people! i'm almost at 600 friends! of seven people left, whom of which would be willing to satisfy this small victory of mine?"
"if the sky falls today, we always have the choice of burying ourselves underground  who's in?"

friends come and go; you have yourself forever
