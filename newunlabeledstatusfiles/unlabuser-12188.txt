"gearing up for summer house painting , redecorating and golf- can't wait!"
still waiting for the golf as my favorite local golf course is underwater   <propmale> didn't like my suggestion of turning the course into  natanis waterpark- long flume rides ending in ponds (fairway flume or tomahawk toboggan)   i think it could work!
a full tummy     twice-a-day workouts start monday!!
"twice a day workouts started on monday, only to pull a muscle!  that's age for ya!"
"a great day~ picked up paint for the upstairs hall, bathroom and bedroom, sanded, washed, spackeled and trimmed(just the hall)~ saw two moose (have only seen a glimpse of one in my lifetime) who <propmale> out for a while- we had a nice chat and grilled burgers"
trever leaves tomorrow for his first overnight sports camp-lacrosse (thank goodness it's at <propfirst>!)

"nest fell today, some porky babies and their movement caused it to fall   thank goodness for some boys quick thinking: one captured the baby birds with plastic bag covered hands, four others formed a circle so the babies would be cornered-  all four babes"
"these \late\"" nights are killing me!  i must be getting old or somethin'~"""
"glorious sun!  yeah-  pool day, belgrade lakes later and then off to the beach for the first time in forever tomorrow! (how shameful is that!  i didn't go to a <propfirst> beach last summer!)"
come on watson!!!! two holes left!!!!!!!  fingers crossed- gotta go sit out on the deck- can't watch        
"popham's new bathroom changing facility is sssoooooooo much better than those ol' stink-hole, curtained changing stations!  what an improvement!  reliable source said that <propmale>'s new facility is next!!!"
"arrived home, trever and his friend were innocently playing a video game in the basement   looking around, a few things were a little different in the house, things were moved and a plant had two orange sticks protruding from the foliage   holding two ner"
"gearing up for more painting (inside)  can't wait to finish the home improvement phase   but first, a game or two of farkle "
entry painted!  phew!  now to tackle the large basement!
"hhhmmm, paint first or stain wood trim- gut tells me the wood trim- i can paint over the stain when i get it on the wall (yeah, i know i will) "
family weekend- so psyched!!  (does anyone still say psyched??)  shazam!
"more home improvement-  all the kitchen knobs are changed!  hhhmmm,  should i attempt to paint some walls in the living room?  i'll wait for my sister so she can give me the yeah neah-  she should have been an interior designer    smile "
