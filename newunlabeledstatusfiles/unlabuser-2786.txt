"we got quite a bit of snow yesterday and this morning, but i'd like to see another foot so i can have the day off  but wait, i only live 3 blocks from work   make that 2 feet "
"i feel like i'm playing hookie, but i guess that is why i have over 140 hours of pto  i'm going to take it easy for the next couple of days and tell myself that 43 is the new 23 "
"you and i wake up in a psychiatric <propmale> together  using 4 words what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well   be a good sport and play along    4 words is harder than you think"
