"giving myself til wed to complete my mission   get ready, im a woman possessed!"
dilemma: do i get my wrist looked at by a qualified physician and risk being told not to skate on the 4th   or do i wait and ignore the new bump and swelling?

"just had the most incredible night  started with an epic derby battle with the greatest fans cheering me on, had a few drinks,posed on a classic 1950 buick, stole a tank and ended with a caramel brownie  does it get better?"
i love being a derby girl!
"i'm freezing, my eyes are watery, my hair's one big knot   but there's nothing like spending the day with a <propmale> between my legs!"
here we go again!
"today, i reached a new level of maturity when i passed a busstop in the rain and did not drive though the puddle and spray the people "
welp   another one bites the dust
great day! flew in a b52! almost makes up for the low blow i received last night   
"spangler, wont go to heaven\she's just another lost soul about to be mine again\leave her, we will receive her\it is beyond your control will you ever meet again   "
"yeah, the guitarist wanted me   "
one of those days   and no nessey to vent to  sad

"grilled chicken and zucchini, steamed shrimp on baby greens, and now <propfemale> n garlic pork loin roast   being on a diet sucks!"

"i know heart will never be the same, but i'm telling myself it'll be ok\even on my weakest days   i grow a little bit stronger"
why is it that every guy that hits on me is from <propfemale>?
"oh god, i hate my classes this semester"
broken hearted   i think its run its course
