is pretty sure i've never been prouder of my boys; they went to a lady's house down the street whose husband passed away the other day to ask her if she's ok and if they could do anything   then they did a little yardwork without e playful ecting any compensation!  all this of their own volition; i almost cried   
"there are 2 plans for your life: the enemy's plan to steal, kill and destroy; and the good shepherd's plan to give you abundant life   the one you believe (agree with) largely determines which plan comes to pass   "
