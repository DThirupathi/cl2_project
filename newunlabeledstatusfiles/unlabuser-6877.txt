dancing with angels
dreaming of the angel i love 
the demons    theirs so many thriving off me    will i live or die against them 
im pathetic  i will never be wanted
is as mad as a hatter
its so lonely being in this dark and lonely plane of life as an outcast    she doesnt want me and im not wanted    what next?
      left    no maybe right      which way was it again      
left     or was it right     do i use the sword     or do i use the mace      im already surronded     well here goes nothing 
intresting    
      damit  i just i   
im graduating! wooooo
no more school    
im not sure how i did it but i graduated 
i am so close to moving into the battlefield  i can almost hear it in the distance  hmmmm  my turn for some action? here goes!
     you know what screw me and screw my future 
mmmmm      maybe i can see an angel some time soon 
here i stand waiting    so now i prepare for the battles ahead 
why have i been so very much sad lately    
i have travelled everywhere even to hell to find love but it seems there is no love for one suited for the battlefield 
"here i stand, helpless and left for dead close your eyes,i believe in you,i won't stay long, in this world so wrong and i don't mind\if you say this love is the last time \just give me a sign"
all packed up now just have to move over to vegas!
im tired    i hope i can get my id soon so i can get a job  its really boring sitting around here most of the time 
"i dance by the <propfemale> light,\i dance with you to a new height "
do you even know why your fighting or the damage you create?
i loved a girl and she not only broke my heart but also let me down more than once  now im lost in a sea of sorrow drowning to the bottom 
war is not an easy thing  espicially when your opponents are akrid creatures     and there categore g's are bigger then three story houses 
i have all but forgotten what it means to be human 
here i stand helpless and left for dead 
im sorry <propfemale>  i have seen skies and moons but now i travel to were outcasts go  the place between the heavens and hells 
"no longer the lost \no longer the same \and i can see you starting to break \i'll keep you alive \if you show me the way \forever - and ever \the scars will remain \i'm falling apart \leave me here forever in the dark \\daylight dies \blackout the sky \does anyone care? \is anybody there? \take this life \empty inside \i'm already dead \i'll rise to fall again"
maybe <propfirst> is right 
"i'm all out of breath \my walls are closing in \days go by \give me a sign"
what do i do    this pressure is over whelming    now my worlds is crumbling down around me 
to bad vampires arent real  id love to become one and disappear forever 
"i have fought countless of wars against demons and angels,\but no matter how long this fight goes on i can never find her \as my world goes darker i choose exile \i am an out cast that has angel wings and a dragon tail,\my hair is long and <propfemale> white with eyes red but still human "
i had the most real feeling strangest dream yet 
did i make a mistake?     
mmmm <propfemale>     hehehe    oddly enough i feel super happy 
well its time to sleep  i await the arrival of my teacher lord revan  i will not fail him this time 
im not sure what to do anymore  i will wait for lord revan now  maybe he has new things to teach me and set me back on the right path 
if i made a mistake its believing that humanity has truly pure good intentions 
why is this so hard 
its all so cold     let me sleep 
i have dreamed millions of dreams but none so perfect as the ones with you in them 
i will risk losing everything including my life if only to finnaly be loved 
"chains as old as time,\and a love thats not mine \free me if your brave,\but dont does so without crave "
i believe that this will all come to a close  the sound and color of the world will disappear and only then will i remember is the beggining 
"when all grows dark\and all hope is lost \call out the name of an outcast,\and he or she shall guide you back to the light "
i wanted her to love me but idk if she will  i will use my life to protect humanity even though i hate it  i will protect all human life because that has become more precious than anything else i know 
"i believe in you, i can show you that i can see right through all your empty lies \i won't stay long, in this world so wrong "
im happy with who i am  i am an outcast of a specific species  if you dont like it i dont give a damn 
i was wrong before  maybe i was wrong about <propfemale> to  i choose to learn from my teacher  i will never let myself down again like i did so many times before 
"i believed your lines\the heart cried for a time \i fell into vines\and this time its mine "
do you remember when you cried out to the heavens for help but i was the only one who answered 
i seem to have lost my own heart to the darkness 
i have been able to hate so many people so why cant i hate you    
well that was one interesting adventure 
all i ask is for you to believe in me 
"every street in this city\is the same to me\everyone's got a place to be\but there's no room for me\am i to blame?\when the guilt and the shame\<propfemale> over me\like a dark cloud that\chases you down\in the pouring rain"
i wonder how much blood would pour out before i died if i cut the vital spots on my arms open 
â€œi am ready to meet my maker  whether my maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is another matter â€�- <propmale> churchill
please forgive me for the choice i have made  im sorry  but theres not turning back now  i want to dream of a beautiful place and i want to stay there 
"somewhere in this darkness\there's a light that i can't find\maybe it's too far away   \or maybe i'm just blind   "
there was nothing i could do  it wont be long before its time to return to the darkness and wait until the time arises again 
dont look down on me just because im an outcast and dont belong in heaven or hell like those angels and demons  chances are i am more gratefull and forgiving than you 
i kneel before no god  the only one i will obey is the one who i stand with 
you didnt want my outcast or angel side  fine you will only see my dragon side if we ever see or talk to eachother again 
the right path could also be the wrong one  make your choice carefully 
"when i walk into the valley of hell\i will only have my sword and lance \i will stand alone and free us all "
theres always a choice that has to be made  did i make the right choice though?
i want to believe in myself  but now im not so sure anymore 
i was wrong about every god damn thing  i was always wrong 
"every street in this city\is the same to me\everyone's got a place to be\but there's no room for me\am i to blame?\when the guilt and the shame\<propfemale> over me\like a dark cloud that\chases you down\in the pouring rain\it's not what it seems\when you're not on the scene\there's a chill in the air\but there's people like me\that nobody sees\so nobody cares"
"intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life \you should have learned by now, i'll burn this whole world down \i need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind \you think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind "
usted dioses y godesses creer su caja  usted haber destruir <propfemale>  serÃ© viendo usted todo muy pronto  y usted testamento palpar mi wraith como yo matar cada y todo el mundo de usted 
what am i supposed to do now 
despite everythin and even though she wont know  i apologize and forgive <propfemale>  i also let go of her to do some soul searching and find my lost soul 
"the chains are back dragging me down \i will find a way to show you the light,\even if i have to let it all rush out \let this worlds light fade away as the blood rushs out "
my teacher once told me to never stop fighting for those you care for and what you believe in  he however never told me how hard it was when everything came crashing down at once 
the world may not be a beautiful place  shit may hit the fan more than you would want it to  but i learned from my mom that you have to make the world beautiful for yourself 
i can't help but feel that everything that has happened to all my freinds and the one i love is my fault 
wanting to know the truth is good  but sometimes the truth hurts so its best not to know 
"i have a dream that has haunted my thoughts for years  if it comes true, i can only hope humanity is ready "
"dull drums in the distance,\the light fades as hope dies in his heart "
"\thirty troops against 200 of us? how do you plan on taking us all down?\"" laughing the stuipid enemy commander \",8c42822ea3b94b1a laugh a2d0a46e6995b7,me a beast? no i am not  im only half dragon and half angel  but i will destroy everything in my path if enraged 
it was all lies    the chains are tearing my body as they drag me back into oblivion 
i dont belong in this world  the sorrow shall kill me now 
i know that she has always lied to me    so why do i still feel the same towards her?
my time here is coming to a close  a few more days and ill be visiting barstow to make my own grave made of my own blood 
the blood of the damned runs through my veins  thats why i believe fully in redemption 
you do not listen  so how would you know if something was wrong?
i messed up so much  i have been called a man but i dont feel like one  i look older but i dont feel older  i continue to make the same one mistake 
i still have a long way to go but i have a better grasp of myself now 
i am home now  ill have to learn more now 
"you are so beautiful, you are the kind of girl\that has the chemicals that makes me fall in love\beautiful, you are the kind of girl, that has the chemicals\that makes me fall in love"
no matter how strong a person may seem there is always one person they have a weakness for 
i have given this alot of thought  as a person i am complex  even though i may seem cold i can be very easy and kind  i thought of love and marriage  but could i be a father?
rush to battle over love and die for nothing  now rise up strong warrior covered in your own blood  now raise your blood soaked sword and fight your way to life 
in a world full of ignorance and fouls can an outcast like me be accepted?
"how could you understand what i say?!\you do not listen and do not pay attention  so how would you know if something was bringing me down?"
im not sure i understand  is there a place for me in this world? i have never been so confused 
i consume to much? ok  lets cut it down considerably 
if the world was to die tommorow what would you regret?
3 days 
anger always blows over  also causes stuipid actions 
"life isnt about the pain, fustration, and anger that come along so often but instead those rare special moments that touch your heart "
i have my id finnaly but i look retarded in my picture and my writing looks like crap  dammit 
i finnaly let some of my high school freinds in and tell them one of my most hidden secrets and they betray me  some freinds    this is why i cant let anyone in 
"full of fear,\ever clear \i'll be here,\fighting forever \curious,\venomous,\you'll find me\climbing to heaven \never mind,\turn back time \you'll be fine - i will get left behind \show me what it's like\to dream in black and white,\so i can leave this world tonight "
"we are the shadow, the smoke in your eyes, the ghosts that hide in the night "
theres a lot of things you can learn to understand in this world ranging from languages to technology  but you can never fully understand the pain of another unless you have gone through the same things and felt the same feelings 
i loved you and i trusted you <propfemale> <propfemale> magnia but you havnt even scratched the surface on me  you have no clue about who i am and never will 
darkness
thanks to <propfirst> mcmanus for sending me beech at-10 wichita  i really like it! http annoyed  apps facebook com band-of-hero-fhfhda home?url=&tv3=mkrragqaeekvxc2aljtfhy6bh0igbhkybatu3u4ggw%3d%3d
the light at the end of the darkness 
well this is interesting 
vampires glitter? dating humans? what is wrong with these vampires  i am a classic vampire thats way more badass 
"i held my breath as clouds began to form\but you were lost in the beating of the storm\but in the end we were meant to be apart\in separate chambers of the human heart"
"born into a world of death and sorrow \warriors follow there own paths leading them to the truth,\if a warrior ends up on the wrong side or not is a diffrent story "
im not to sure what im going to do anymore  i lost the only person i truly cared for when i moved and the chances of me getting into the military are at best a 25% shot that the accident didnt fuck up my chances of getting in 
wow that was a long time with out the internet  good to be back 
what does it mean to have a path if your a lone wolf that cant be part of a pack because you dont feel right in any?
it doesnt make sense yet but i feel good about myself 
ill complete the mission and save the hostage if you provide the chinese stealth suit 
"when traveling the wasteland around dc i take my chinese stealth suit, gauss rifle, and plasma rifle  never know when youll run into enclave or super mutants "
lately i have been making a lot of fallout 3 refrences     i miss that game 
i wonder    
take me to the seven bladed kingdom 
dont underestimate me 
i wonder what the future holds for me  to soon to find out and not coming nearly as fast enough 
"daylight dies \blackout the sky \does anyone care? \is anybody there? \take this life \empty inside \i'm already dead \i'll rise to fall again"
