gradually the life keeps getting sucked further and further out of me    im in a tunnel with a small opening that never seems to get bigger no matter how fast i run    how long can one stand this? how long should one hold on?
hmm  
although lifes been rough   and it will continue to  it feels just great at the moment when i know there are special events to come here soon  just live in the moment and don't look too far in the future  around the bend will be more trouble and hard times but <propfemale> the small special events along the way   wink

one of the biggest things i was looking forward to at the end of this month    i just found out is not going to happen  what am i going to do?
so i was dared by a friend of mine to do this so here it goes lol     (if you read this please answer the questions) would you go out with me? i mean if i was actually interested in a gf right now and if you didn't already have a guy? am i a decent guy or the type of guy you would actually wanna go out with? be honest! please   no liars lol
when life seemed it was the best and nothing could possibly go wrong   it went south so fast! it doesn't make much sense   it is great now knowing that i have goals and there is something constantly keeping me going!
can't wait for the day when everything will be ok! for he will shine his love down on me and make me realize nothing in the world matters  that he is what i need to focus on  he has shown his light so i can see the end of the dark tunnel and i can't wait to get to the end 
last night was awesome!! great to get away! too cold though lol could have still been better!
ugh in a lot of pain!!! got hit in the ribs by a fence panel and then a darn goat stabbed me between my fingers with her horns!!! what the heck! i'm tired of this!!!
ugh i dont know whats worse! yesterday getting hit or today with the after effects?!? i can't wait for all of this to never happen again! 9 months and freedom! 9 months and i will be starting an amazing new future with special people and friends who care   smile  can't wait!!
well today was better   umm day 3 and still my ribs hurt!!  annoyed      to feel loved and safe is a feeling i can't wait to feel  my friends will finally be able to be there for me and i can be there for them   but especially for the one in my thoughts that i can't get out!  smile 
finally starting to feel normal again although i can still feel a small pain in my ribs and actually still in my jaw!  annoyed      but it will get better! life will continue on and just hoping time will fly by so i can be with who i want to be with! and be more free!
why does life have to be so hard? why does the people that should be there and love you and support you have to all be totally against you? why do they beat you down like your nothing more than a speck of dirt? how long can one take the constant tearing and ripping down? i hate the feeling of your heart being blown up and ripped in 2  gosh darn    life sucks!
"y does life have to suck? y have i held on this long   y haven't i done something?     the vet was here today and i sooo badly wanted to just yell and scream \they murdered my dog! get them for animal cruelty!\""    in reality ppl ask how i feel and   i could say angry   i could say sad   but truthfully i'm scared   that   that could have been me!  annoyed """
life goes on    i hate the dull feeling inside! numb to almost all emotions   i wanna cry but just cant   wanna scream but it doesnt help   wanna curl up and never deal with anything again but it doesn't work    annoyed 
my thoughts are my own no one need to hear them anymore    if you want to know how i'm doing i guess you'll have to ask  and if you want details i guess you will need to ask specifics  doors are closed   annoyed  i cant handle this stuff anymore like i used to and have a lot of thinking to do 
when things don't go right    at all   and all you want to do is cry but your emotions are <propfemale>o screwed up you that you can't even cry! it is the weirdest and hardest feeling to deal with   its <propfemale> swelled up and along with your head all scrambled with thoughts and decisions its all together bad  ; 
i hate minds! y do they have to be so cluttered  i hate thoughts and i hate decisions especially hard ones  i really don't wanna do this anymore  ugh  sad 
through all the hard times and the problems that have arose i could have just layed down and died but instead i chose to stand and try! when this all passes i guess i shall be a stronger person 
sitting here watching my world crumble  hitting my head against the wall hoping something will come to mind to fix it all  everything i say or do screws things up  makes me wonder if i wanna see the light of day  i'm sitting here in the dark and all i wanna do is cry  wow! oh my for the first time in a while   i have today  even when i thought my emotions were gone   ig i was wrong! so backed up they finally blew 
today is a good day! now i finally break free and get away to breathe! 5 whole days without the bickering and nagging and everything else  thanks to god! my drive will be long but totally worth it   (but i think you should txt me or call me anytime so i'm not alone and bored 641-352-0888 [ smile

trust is a fragile thing  think of it as a very old antique glass vase  it is a very beautiful thing and takes or took a lot of work to build it  but then imagine someone smashing it with a sledge hammer to little pieces! it is one of the hardest things in the world to rebuild  it takes a lot of time nothing can put that back together again over night  be careful with it and think before you make decisions   
took my puppy for a nice loooong walk (6 <propmale>)! feels great to be taking walks again! great way to think about things and clear the mind! also helps making decisions easier and makes the day better! (especially since i usually sleep right after the walk because i'm worn out lol) today was a great day off work and at home! (never thought i'd say those two things lol! ;p

so    i had to go check to see if our goose was back on her nest  buttt when i went out to do that i found a opossum at the back of the house attacking a cat so i ran inside to grab a pistol and i chased the damn thing and killed it lol
its pretty sad i guess when you sit on your day off and wish you were working lol    but todays such a happy day! it feels <propfemale> good to have large decisions made and for everything in your life to seem somewhat headed in a perfect direction   smile  i love life right now!
i left our screen door unlatched and the wind caught it and broke it in half     great 2 doors in less than a week  what's the chances of that?!
why do siblings think they rule the world?! do they have to be allowed to barge into any part of the house they want just cuz they think they lost an animal?! hmm?! then they are allowed to yell at you as much as they want but don't dare say anything back cuz you'll get in trouble! ugh
there are certain things in life we must do even though they may be the hardest thing we could do  in order to do them we must seperate our brain from our gut and just do it 
just ready to lay here and think   hate this gut feeling! gut let my brain do its job    please?!
well the verdict is in     im sick of my hair   can't stand it anymore soooooooo    i consulted my decision assistant  wink  and im going back to the salon to get it done again lol

 smile 
one of the worst things in life that happens over and over again   is getting your hopes up  we all do it constantly  why? why doesn't it ever click in our minds that almost every time we do that our hopes are crushed? no matter what we do to try not to get our hopes up we always do   we may not tell ourselves that we got our hopes up but when we are alone we dwell on it and it hurts   just some thoughts 
i hate feeling like shit!!! someone get a sponge i need something to soak up liquids

everything in our lives has a timeline  some are short others are longer and some are never ending  so many different emotions are tied to every single one  what really sucks is when you've seen something ahead of time and keep hoping it wont come soon    and then it hits you between the eyes and you dont know what to do 
going to the pool  smile 
work then movie night  smile 
"work  annoyed  then idk   boredom, rest, and txting lol"
