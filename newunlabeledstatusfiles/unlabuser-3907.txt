"finally home from work  time to relax, if <propfirst> lets me that is  smile "
"okay so the us isn't the greatest place to be anymore but that still doesn't make it okay for everyone to hate everything about it  i don't understand why people come here and complain about how shitty it is compared to their country   um, does the plane fly only one way? our government may suck ass but that does not mean i should be ashamed of where i come from and lived my whole life "
