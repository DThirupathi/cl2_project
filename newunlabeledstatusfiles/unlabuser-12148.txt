tierd and going to bed  a long day and not a long enough night! need to give connor some childrens nyquil again for his stuffy nose and cough! it worked last nigh    lets see about tonight!
"does anybody know how hard it is to eat some eggs with tortillas when you are trying to do things on fb?? not very easy, ill tell you that! dinner know at 830 after getting the kids off to bed and doing the dishes! not a very exciting night for me is it?"
whats a good home remedy to use to make you not pissed off when u r extremely pissed off? and it cant be alcohol cause i cant use that at work! i need something that works that i can use anywhere!
"hum <propfirst> dum <propfirst> dum      not a good night sleep thanks to connor! had to sleep with me and i cant sleep with him! hopefully tonight will be better! need to wash all of his bedding stuff though, so thats my chore when i get home!"
"caleigh is sick, maybe an ear infection  she is super stuffy and when i put her to bed last night she said her ear hurt  didnt sleep good either  that stwo nights of bad sleep for me! how sad!! oh well, thats what happens when you have kids! love them to death, even if they are sick and you have to stay up all night and take care of them!!!"
"well, took caleigh to urgent care today after work and sat there forever, but at least she got seen  she has bronchitis again!!! just starting it though  her ear was a little red, but they said it didnt look like an ear infection, just irritated  maybe a slight sinus infection  sooooo, she got zythromax and she will be better in the morning because it works miracles!!!"
"so, did the dishes and now i need to go to bed! so i heard it was supposed to snow this weekend! that would be nice  i remember it snowed 3 years ago and it was so cool, but it didnt stick and that made me mad! i want to play in the snow!!!"
"so it snowed everywhere but here on saturday! so mad  the kids wanted to play in it, but that didnt happen  well, off to bed now  going to be so tierd tomorrow, but what else is new! haha!"
"well, off to bed soon! have a crazy week ahead  chey is sick now, just a low fever of 100 and nothing else! whatever bug this is is just a pain in the ass! cant go to school with a fever and it is the first day of school she has missed all year! im pissed and she is mad that she cant be at school! she loves it!! oh well, we will see how things go over night and see if she gets to go tomorrow!!"
"well, had a good day  got my iphone 4 today on my lunch! so excited  been wanting one since they came out!! hopefully chey will be going to school tomorrow  i think she is better, just full of drama! maybe thats why she likes doing the plays at school with her teacher!!"
"well chey missed school again today, but good news, i think she is going to school tomorrow! yeah!! no fever all day today! hopefully none tonight  that's when she has been getting them "
well figured out the problem with my phone and the internet  just had to clear everything and turn it off then back on again  duh!! chey was back at school today and so excited! getting ready for bed now  need to sleep and stop playing with the phone!
well i'm getting off work in a little bit to go get my eyes checked and cheys too! so excited to get new contacts and glasses!! great start to a great weekend! have a great weekend everyone!

im at work on my lunch and im tired! i need to get some sleeping pills! i cannot sleep good lately and i dont know why!! i need to sleep about 10 hours without waking up once! maybe ill feel rested then!
so i'm at home trying to go to sleep and my oh so good son connor won't go to sleep after getting in trouble for not listening ever since we got home! why does this always happen to me and when will it stop?? hopefully soon?

so going to bed now!! had a long day and getting use to being at work at 8 in the morning  loving getting off at 4 smile 0ish!!! more time to spend with my hubby and kids!!
so exhausted and don't know why! maybe allergies    i thought i slept good last night but apparently not! i'm going to bed as soon as connor falls asleep! hopefully soon!!
"think i'm going to bad now! tired an irritated at the same time is not a good combo! i have a feeling that i am going to be up a lot tonight because the wheels in my brain won't stop turning!! that sucks! well, bring on friday!!"
"so tired  hardly any sleep last night between the three kids, and i'm not including chey!! yes <propfirst> would be one of them! <propfemale>'s birthday party, cleaning, shopping, and laundry took up the whole day today! i'm ready for bed now!"
"watching the proposal right now!! i love it! makes me laugh!! didn't get half of what i wanted to get done this weekend before caleighs birthday, but i guess i'll deal with it later!"
"hmmmmm, it's 9 smile 0 and connor is still awake! can we say stubborn!?!? i guess he'll be going to bed early tomorrow! sorry ms  gandy, hope u have fun with him tomorrow!!"
finally some peace and quiet! all kids asleep except for connor      again! maybe he'll go to sleep before 9:45 tonight! who knows  slept till almost 3 smile 0 at school today!
"so, i took connor to the bathroom and got him back on bed and i ask him if i can sleep with him and he tells me no  i ask him why and he proceeds to tell me that i have my own bed! all i have to say is that next time he wants to sleep in my bed, he is going to get the same response!"
"time to spend some quality time with <propfirst> tonight!! it's his late night and after the kids go to bed, i get to have some \grown up\"" conversation!!"""
