"change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood andinvite\your friends to do the same  until monday, december 6th, there should \be no human faces on facebook, but an invasion of memories  this is for \awareness of violence against children "
"i just heard!!    did you know that the group asking everyone to change their profile picture to a cartoon character is actually a group of child pervs  they are doing it because kids will accept their friend request faster if they see a cartoon picture  it has nothing to do with supporting child violence, it was on tv and its on tonight's news  put this on your status to warn everyone & to get them to change back!"
