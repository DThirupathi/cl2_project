"sometimes you have to run away so you can see who will follow you, sometimes you have, to talk quieter to see who is listening, sometimes you have to step up in a fight to see who is by your side, sometimes you have to make a wrong decision  to see who will fix it, & sometimes you have to let go of the one you love just to see if they love you enough to come back "
