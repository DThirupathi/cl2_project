"well soul searching and self preservation is a must  love,humor,excitement,and caring are just a few of the things that being able to share with others makes life worth living and learning but throughout that learning process we learn that almost nothing last forever! lonliness,sadness,pain,anger, resentment and all the other emotions arrive when situations get stagnant or stale "

"the truth is, i get impatient  after persuing a dream for so long[with no success], i think it's over but something inside of me tells me that god's heart aches to see me giving up so quickly i know i have the god-given right to have confidence in the hopes of my heart so if i really believe that god created me from the inside out then i have to trust that those passions will come in his time and for his purpose!"
"just one song can spark a moment,one smile begins a friendship,one handclasp lifts a soul,one laugh will conquer gloom  one step will start each journey,one hope will raise our spirits,one touch can show you care,one heart can know what's true,one life can make a difference you see, it's up to you because what lies behind us and what lies before us, are <propfemale> matters compared to what lies within us!"
"each player must accept the cards life deals  but once they are in hand, we must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game  because dreams are renewable and no matter what our circumstances,condition,or age, there are still untapped possibilities within us and new ideas waiting to be born!"
