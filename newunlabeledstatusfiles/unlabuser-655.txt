"to say whats on my mind at the moment would be total chaos     sadden,anger,confusion,love,dissapointment   so meaning feelings all balled into one and yet no answers of whats to come    "
so many people get so worked up over stupid shit that they act out irrationally and then no one knows the real story except the main characters and in some cases no one wants to listen neither sooo in the end it is sad to know of these things but everything happens for a reason-fate takes course   good or bad   
watching manson-my name is evil     got to love yourself a killer movie sometimes

"whatever you give a woman, she makes it greater  give her sperm, she gives you a baby  give her a house, she gives you a home  give her groceries, she gives you a meal  give her kindness, she gives you her heart  she multiplies & enlarges what she is given  so if you give her crap, be        ready to get a ton of shit! post this on your wall if you agree  i hope to see every female repost this!!"

"the grinch, with his grinch-feet ice cold in the snow,stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? it came without ribbons  it came without tags  it came without packages, boxes or bags  and he puzzled and puzzled 'till his puzzler was sore  then the grinch thought of something he hadn't before  what if christmas, he thought,doesn't come from a store  what if christmas,perhaps, means a little bit more   "
"i'm not superstitious, but this year july has 5 fridays, 5 saturdays and 5 sundays  this happens once every 823 years  this is called money bags  so, copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days  based on chinese feng shui  the one who does not copy     will be without money  i cannot let that person be me"
