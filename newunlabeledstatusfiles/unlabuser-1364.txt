"yesterday i exercised my right at a citizen 21 years of age and casually walked into hannford's and purcased a 12-pack of <propfirst> adams winter lager  a strange e playful erience, but a good one   laugh "
i would like it if blizzard made sure that their services worked before implementing <propmale> changes to their games  -cough- 3 3 0 -cough- disconnected from server at login  :<
they had to cancel all classes *after* my first  :<

blarg 
<propfirst> adams <propmale> pils is pretty good 
not quite sure what to think of the ipad 
a winter storm warning for heavy snow means severe winter weather conditions are e playful ected or occurring  significant amounts of snow are forecast that will make travel dangerous  only travel in an emergency  if you must travel    keep an extra flashlight    food    and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency 
does nobody have anything better to do then give me invites to a game on facebook?
"over 5 years ago, i started playing wow when classic came out  it was fun, had no problem with it  i even put up with leveling on a pvp server  what happened? every time i run an instance i'm surrounded by idiots, and when i'm not, wow disconnects or crashes  blizzard, what the hell have you become, that is almost as bad a cryptic  :<"
all i see is farmville this and farmville that  doesn't anyone have anything better to do?
eh?
eh 
last straw  it's time for my tower to become immune to the majority of malicious software  time to do a backup for ~800-900gb and install *nix  windows no more  d:

i find it amusing how captain janeway loves to piss off the borg 
has learned that the electric field generated by an ac current running through a wire can cause distortion through an optical spdif cable 
i think i can learn to love having a pint while i wait for a sandwich

"last night i witnessed a well constructed plan carried out to steal a 30-pack of <propmale> from mobile in hampton  it was done flawlessly, except that there are cameras all around the mobile and i'm sure his face is on at least one of the cameras   playful "

"my monitor was acting weird, making a quick buzzing noise then screen goes away  had to power-cycle the monitor to get it to work  if i need to move on to rma #5 with hann(spree sg) i'm demanding a refund  note to all, never get a hannspree or hannsg monitor  every one i've gotten has been a lemon (all 4 of them so far, i'm on replacement #4 and this will make 5 lemons if it completely stops working )"

"gahhh  i was walking to class, and half way there, out of no where, it started down-pouring  by the time i got back to my apartment i was drenched  d:"
a useless facebook status update 
oh god  patch 4 0 0  talents will never be the same  t t
