"if you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them   they will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior   it is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch  share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness "

it's stylish and socially-acceptable to be apathetic towards and uninvolved in politics  too bad it's the single-most important thing you could divulge your attention on  and too bad big businesses don't have the same priorities as everyday people
