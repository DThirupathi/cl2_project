had a great time out friday night but was so sick on saturday he could not move out the bed all day  i think i must be allergic to the club or something           or maybe the spirits i consumed that night  *note to self* just because people buy you a drinks does not mean you have to drink them 
"had a really good time at work today  i love my job  i always come away feeling those goose bumps i get when i really connect with and help someone  every day as i learn more, im feeling more and more fulfilled  although there is something that my heart is missing at the moment                  "

"implying that all individuals in the field are the same because they have similar degrees is like saying that everyone who went to school for business have the same degree    i have been studying human thoughts, behaviors, and emotions every since i was a kid  although finances have interrupted my education, i am always researching, analyzing, studying, and gaining e playful erience in my lifeâ€™s passion  i have and i am sti"

"thank you god for blessing me to see 29 when i was told i would never see 21  thank you for ordering my steps, guiding my heart, and allowing me to touch as many as i have  although the road has almost never been easy, you have always been by my side and for that i will always feel blessed  you have and will always be the guiding force in all i do and for that on this day i praise you "

is watching her name was <propfirst>  which has been really interesting and eye opening  although i am gay i know very little about trangenders (people for some reason think they go hand in hand and they always dont)  hopefully this e playful erience will teach me to be more knowledgable and helpful with those individuals i come into contact with  people are people  love them for who they are and not who you want them to be 
"is thanking god for all the wonderful love and blessings he has allowed my life to be graced with even when i am too deep in all the problems of the world to appreciate it  thanking him for the people, love, and his grace that touches my life at all times when i am in the midst of doing what i feel he sent me to this earth to do "

so yeah my phone was stolen last night  and before i could disconnect it they had changed my voice mail message and erased all my messages (shl) so if you calling and not getting me that's why  but in every trial god sends a blessing  thanks again to everyone who supported me last month  i tried to personally answer your message but in case i did not  thanks again 
it's official  i'll be relocating to <propmale> in the beginning of july  so wish me luck and send blessings that everything flows right and according to god's plan  any good suggestions or advice is always welcome 
is e playful eriencing a lot of different emotions in reference to his life changing as he packs up to move out his apt  but what i am going to focus on is being positve and having faith  much love and blessings to everyone 
is such an emotional man like my mom likes to say  lol  im packing and reminiscing about my last 7 years in atl  i keep so many lil keepsakes from almost everything that happens in my life in a box  so packing is like walking down memory <propfirst>  no matter the hardships i really enjoyed my life here  i grew into a man  i caint believe im leaving  but my heart is pulling me  lets see what this new chapter will bring 
omg  i thought moving was rough  relocating is a bit**  so even wih all the pre planning and organizing i still did not leave on schedule and spent more money then i thought  but i am finally on the road and heading for <propmale>  wish me luck and blessings on this drive home 
in <propmale> getting my mind geared up for new beginnings  this move already is teaching me a lot about myself and other people  sometimes its not the situation or challenge u face but how u choose to handle(negatively or positively) it and whether you will use it to grow or let it destroy u and all u may have  im choosing to grow and excel and use everything to move towards my dreams  will u win or lose? you choose!
time in <propmale> is getting better and better by the moment  the longer i am here the more i feel this may be the place for me  i feel peace in my soul  can family really be the one thing my heart was missing  i am really hopeful that this move will bless me in many different ways to come  thanks everyone for all your support as i go through this transition  much love to everyone 
in atl staring at my apt that needs so much cleaning and packing of stuff i might scream  this vacation was more work then anything  time to breathe and get to work  thanks to rashaad newsom <propfirst> <propfemale> <propfirst> dawson torin l  <propfirst> l <propfemale> b  woods   for your help  this move would not have been the same without you 
is happy to say things seem to be going to god's plan  although my plans did not happen the way i thought they should everything still happened  im glad that i have all my old apt things completed and done  special thanks to <propmale> barnes for opening his heart and home to me and mine  it means more then u will ever know 
so your gone  u were right i do miss u but i'm happy your spending time at home  now to continue working and praying on my transition to <propmale> especially the job part  and seeing people before i leave the city  and getting my work out on before disney next week  much love to everyone  have a blessed week 
is thinking there must be something attractive about the situation if i choose to keep dealing even though i think its foolishness  lol  guess i have learned its best to see how something plays out then to use my keen insight to make a decision before it even happens  i have learned that sometimes people will plesantley surprise you  so here's to the best while i look and just smhalas 
is looking forward to his baby coming home tonight  i also go to disney this weekend for the first time in my life with people i really love  so send up blessings and good energy that all goes great  also keep praying about me and my transition  when the praises and prayers go up the blessings come down 
is realizing a vacation for him may never be a vacation  seems like it will always be something stressing me or keeping my anxiety above normal  i really need to get a handle on always caring more about what others want or learn how to only be around me  i always pride myself on being a good(not perfect)man who puts his heart first  it seems the more u strive to be your best others e playful ect u to be perfect  im not

"although my phone has been dead and i got really sick, i am still having a good time at camp high five  note to self: check for all bags before leaving the house(or at least the phone charger) and hyper active sweat glands and sweat soak clothes do not match well inside very air conditioned cabins(summer colds)  see and speak to everyone in the real world on friday "
"last day at camp was really emotional and heart felt  these youth born with hiv through no choice of their own really showed me what u can do with life as long as u have a positive attitude about your situation  yet it was tarnished by 2 close \friends\"" deceiving me over something i would have gladly let them have then were upset that i was hurt by the deceit! then my phone broke  life  u take the good with the bad """

"was disturbed to find out that a decision in regard to his last employment was denied  wont go into detail because im a respectful guy  but it amazes me when people around u can sense know the issues but want u to pretend their not there along with them  yet, when the issues get to the point where u can no longer deal and leave they continue to deny the issues to hinder your progress  well appeal time "

"is in dc  so many new places, people, information, and ideas that my brain feels likes its going to bust  im stepping outside my box in so many ways that sometimes i have to remind myself to breathe  when did the simple helpful small city guy become so much more?"
"had a super sad christmas   sad  reminded me of most holidays as a kid  thought once i grew up, became independent, and found someone to love and care about me being happy all that would change  starting to wonder if i have that personality that makes others eventually get use to me being there and all i give and stop caring about what makes me happy "
"after spending some time praying and having a heart to heart with my mom, i have decided to throw my grown man back on and do my best to not let lifes issues effect a holiday that is really special to me  <propfemale> christmas everyone who i have not text or talk too(new phone so i dont have a lot of <propfirst> anymore)  i hope your holiday is filled with love, happiness, joy, peace, and good holiday spirit all around u "
