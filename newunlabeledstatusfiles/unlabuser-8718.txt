"if you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea\i'll sail the world to find you\if you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see\i'll be the light to guide you\if you toss and you turn and you just can't fall asleep\i'll sing a song beside you\and if you ever forget how much you really mean to me\everyday i will remind you"
"when i step on the scene\y'all know me\'cause i walk with a limp\like a old school pimp, oh real, oh g"
smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 
"would you really catch a gernade,put your hand on a blade, jump in front of a train ,and even take a bullet to the brain for me?"
"you say get your mind outta the gutter     i say, without the gutter my mind would be homeless  lol"
it is better to regret doing something then regret not doing something
one of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that your mouth can`t utter 
the moment we stop fighting for our common man will be the day we lose all humanity
damn girl damn girl you messing with the man girl 
do u want to kick it in the back seat ?
everybody dies but not everybody lives!  wink 
it is better to regret doing something then regret not doing something
sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me !
pretty as a picture sweeter then a swisher!!
if i lay here would you lay with me and just forget the world 
"if you harbor bitterness ,happiness will dock somewhere else "
