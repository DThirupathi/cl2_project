back from vacation^^ the american idol concert rocked my world last night   smile 
taking everything for granted but we still respect the time - we move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine - and i would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines - but i regain repose and wonder how i ended up inside 
"had lots of fun at the baking party, and is now going to go read a book that isn't school-related (omg!)"
summer vacation just wouldn't be the same if i didn't wait for the day before school starts to finish all my homework    heh heh heh    -_-
"woo, marching band today    can't you just see the excitement exuding from me? hmm? well i can't   smile  is 'exuding' a word?"

"no one is ever too old for trick-or-treating  there's just an age when it starts to get awkward if you go by yourself    like, maybe 35, or 40 "
