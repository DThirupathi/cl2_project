life sucks!!!
i swear what is up with the girl that says she my friends then turns around and tells my ex the one ii still love that something happened between me and her ex then sleeps with him to get back at me!
"i hope this guy i met is really as nice as he seems     maybe i can finally have one decent relationship in my life   \i'm hopin' i'm waitin' i'm prayin' i met the one \"""""
i don't know what to do i'm in love with a guy that is already in a relationship and he's 17 years older than me!!! : (
getting my priorities straight! i have to jobs college and a 69 chevy <propfemale> i'm restoring! life cannot be any better!
sometimes i don't understand anything about my life    i seriously thought this guy was interested in me and now he's completely ignoring me  now i understand why i stay depressed all the time  i guess getting a 4th job would be good for me   
deliberated a 4th job   i can work myself to death! won't have to worry bout anything else in life   just getting to work on time and getting enough sleep   lol like my 5 hours a night is enough anyway!
finally woke up i crashed from lack of sleep

i can't wait until this summer   taking my criminal justice courses  watch out! of course bikini season as well   
"love is irrational, i reminded myself  the more you loved someone, the less sense anything made "

"nothing hurts more than being friends with someone, knowing you are both in love with each other, and yet not being able to be together "
"i've built a wall not to block anyone out, but to see who loves me enough to climb over it "
soul fire    his word is like a fire shut up in my bones!
college is going to kill me i don't know if i'm going to find time to sleep with all my homework   maybe it wasn't a good idea to take history and government at the same time  wayyyyyyyyyy tooooooo muchhhh homeworkkkk!!!!!!!!
so glad i met a guy worht dating   finally a decent relationship in my like hope this works out!   well i know it will!!!!!
is it possible to care so much for someone you hardly know??
"life is like a hourglass   ,eventually, everything hits the bottom and all you have to do is wait it out until someone comes along and turns it around "
"love is as must of an object as an obsession, everybody wants it, everybody seeks it, but few will ever acheive it, those who do will <propfemale> it, be lost in it, and among all, never   never forget it "
my flowers are gettin pumbled!
im scared i dont like thunder and lightning
my baby wrote me a song i can't wait to hear it!!
"i want a love like <propfirst> and june, rings of fire burin' with you, i wanna walk the line, walk the line,'till the end of time, i wanna love, love you that much, cash it all in, give it all up, when you're gone, i wanna go too, like <propfirst> and june"
"realize what's important in your life, what you can live with, but most importantly, what you can't live without  <propfemale> that's you"
i strongly dislike waiting for my bf to log on

"you begin to like someone when you learn what makes them laugh, you cannot truely love until you know what makes them cry "
every man is afraid of something  that's how you know he's in love with you; when he's afraid of losing you 
"ways to get to a girls heart--hug her from behind grab her hand when you guys walk next to each other  when standing, wrap your arms around her  cuddle with her dont force her to do anything! 6  write little notes compliment her  when you hug her,hold her in your arms as long as possible say i love you     and mean it! brush the hair out of her eyes comfort her when she cries love her with all your heart "
"jr ,if i could give you one thing in life, i would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me   "
"got off work at 3   sitting here bored as ever, and missing my boyfriend so much it hurts "
taking vitamins like crazy because i miss my long hair!

"what i have with him is worth it  it is worth every lonely night, every tear i cry from missing him, and the pain i feel from not having him close  it is worth it because he is my one and only  when i picture myself years from now, i see only him  no matter how painful distance can be, not having him in my life would be worse "
just got home from work it's raining bad!! talking to my <propfemale> so my day is better!
just finished my chapter 10 quiz for government    never going to listen to my grandma again! told me not to us my book and i failed horribly!!!
"today i begin to understand what love must be,for it exists     when we are parted, we each feel the lack of the other half of ourselves  we are incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost  that is what i imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence "
my car is finally clean   and detailed! cleaned it out and filled a 13 gallon trash bag with trash   lol  never been that bad before!!
