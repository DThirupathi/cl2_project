"the deeper you stick in your vein, the deeper the thoughts  there's no more pain  i'm in heaven  i'm a god  i'm everywhere  i feel so high     "
tired of being an afterthought  tired of being last on everybody's list  tired of these little reminders that i am completely unimportant 
"if you bore me then i'm comfortable  if you interest me, i'm scared  my attraction paralyzes me; no courage to show my true colors that exist  but i want to be the real thing         my make-up's all off  who am i?"

"if nothing is impossible but there are some things in life you just can't have, where does that leave me?"
don't wanna be my friend no more  i want to be somebody else    
i don't like not knowing where my future is headed  i don't like not knowing which path in life will work out the best  how am i suppossed to make decisions if i can't get all the relevant information?
some days i think my life is waning like the <propfemale>
