wow you don't like me!! oh i have a bad attitude??? well cry me river and drown in it !!!
you give my middle finger an erection!!> sad   ha see you think i should be the one suffering but your so  wrong cause obviously its you!!
"cause i may be bad\but iâ€™m perfectly good at it\sex in the air\i donâ€™t care\i love the smell of it\sticks and stones\may break my bones\but chains and whips\excite me"
is currently not people friendly  dealing with stupid people has the ability to make me that way 
"wow  its funny how someone can ruin ur happiness with one word  and u dont even understand, u dont realize every sentence i say im here for u please just take my hand, im here for you just remember that cuz really i always am "
sometimes its easier to hide what you feel    sometimes its easier to pretend you're happy    sometimes its easier to push everyone else away   
"says, always remember that the hurtful words that you say to others, are like nails being hammered into a wall, once they are removed the hole is still there "
and they wonder why on the hateful night i begged god to take my life  cause you regected me all of you regected me  but if you think that hurts try god that rejects you but theres an all time worst what till death regects you   fml    tired of pretending to be happy  im obviously not fooling anyone 
"she tried to hide the whisky on her breath she finally drank her pain away a little at a time but she never could get drunk enough \to get him off her mind until the night  she put the bottle to her head and pulled the trigger and finally drank away his memory\life is short but this time it was bigger than the strength she had to get up off her knees"
"is done, every smile is a lie, every day i barely get by, the person i like the most mainly ignores me, i'm done, life, you have won   "
the worst kind of pain is when you're smiling just to stop the tears from falling 
"<propfemale> fisher guys just suck and most of them do, do the samethings to a gurl to hurt them by lieing i dont agree that they are all the same but yes most are!!! but you will find a good one out there just keep ya head up i love yew girl "
"the smile you see on my face everyday is fake, you may wonder how i can fake it so well, just know that i have been practicing for a long time"
<propfemale> people say that one person broke their heart over and over again just no you only broke my heart once  and it just never healed 
"can't you see what you do to me baby?\you make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac \i'm like a lunatic, you make me sick\you truly are the only one who can do this to me\you just make me get so crazy \i go skitzo, i get so insane i just go skitzophrenic\one minute i want to slit your throat\the next i want to sex \you make me crazy,"
i love how im randomly ditched by u   whatever annoyed 
"don't know if i could ever be without you \'cause boy you complete me\and in time i know that we'll both see that we're all we need\cause you're the apple to my pie\you're the straw to my berry\you're the smoke to my high\and you're the one i wanna marry"
"baby i, love you all the way down \get it right where you like it \i promise, you'll like it (i swear) \just relax and let me make \a move \its our secret \that we'll keep between me and you"
"sex me so good i say blah blah blah \work it, i need a glass of wata \boy oh boy its good to know ya"
"i can tell you wanna taste it, but im gone make you <propmale> it you got to be patient, i like my men patient more <propfemale> you take might get you in more places\you cant be abrasive, have to know to pace it if i let you get up on it, you gotta make a promise that you gone put it on me, like no ones put it on me\dont bore me, just show me, all men talk but don't please i can be a tease but i really wanna please you"
"thinks sugar and spice makes everyone nice, but beer and whisky makes everyone frisky!"
idk if i feel great or bad i got mixed emotions right now ughhh i dont understand you?! i dont understand this whole thing    ? but i can still sit here with a smile?
wow honestly i should be happy right no worries?? wel why do i feel like a worthless piece of shit   i feel depressed and whats the reason to blame   i honestly couldnt tell you crying 
"can i have this dance for the rest of my life? you be my partner day and night, when were together it feels so right"
~this girl right here feels worthless to you  feels worthless to everyone  you dont need me and i get that i guess its what hurts the most~
"~so soft and slow, never knew a guy could be so god damn cold!~"
's head hurts and feels like it is going to e playful lode  i feel so lost and alone right now and don't see much point in fighting anymore  sad 
"she knows what its like to be crying at the edge of her bed, wishing everything would go away "
"~fml~tear my heart open, i sew my self shut, my weakness is, that i care to much, my scars remind us, that the past is real, i tear my heart open, just to feel ~fml~"
~you made me whole then crushed me all in a matter of a silly little moment ~
am i beautiful? can i really make someone happy? wheres my confidence? weres my high self asteem? im afraid i lost it  or maybe you stole it!!! i  hate being fat!!
"when your all alone and the tears are creeping in and the depression takes over, there's nothing you can do to stop it, all you can do is try to survive "
feels about as wanted and useless as a white crayon   
"it seems to me, the harder i try, the harder i fall"
there are some days when i wonder what life would be like for those around me if i never existed  would it really be that bad for them
"wow i post these statuss hopeing one time it will just hit me and maybe ill find out why im so depressed maybe u can help??   if i scream, would you listen? if i cry, would you offer a shoulder? if i died tonight, would you miss me? would your life be better if i were not in it???"
i hope your all happy cuz im pleaseing you all again i give up on myself and my wants and needs so  you can be happy  ill be fine i guess i mean its wat im use to anyways right who cares about me?!?! sad 
going to the doctor with <propfemale> and laden annoyed 
"you have a way of coming easily to me and when you take, you take the very best of me so i start a fight 'cause i need to feel somethin' and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted oh, what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sittin' here thinkin' it through i've never been anywhere cold as you "
some lose some some win some and some never entered the game    i wasn't fortunate enough to stay out of the game and now i'm lying face down in the dirt with a white flag waveing in the air       iv officially lost everything!
still haven't slept i'm going insane(o 0) its been six days and iv only gotten an hours worth of a nap throughout those days help!!!!
"all the pain falling in \all the signs lead back to you \back to whats never said \back and forth - inside my hand \i can't handle this confusion \i'm unable - come and take me away i feel like i - i'm all alone \all by myself i need to get around this \my words i called i don't want them to hurt you \if i show you i don't think you understand \cause no one understands"
"mistreated, misplaced, missundaztood \miss \no way it's all good\"" \",b61f39fb1efdec1918765b1c86ac3b91,if i can't someone as sweet as u i might as well give up on everyone cuz noone will want me     people are harsh and break u down bit by bit ! sad 
life sucks whats the point of it if ur never happy someone answer that for me??? sad  fml
"i'm just too tired to be strong anymore, i need someone to be strong for me for once   i wonder if i will ever be someone's #1 priority instead of being last "
"just when the wounds are almost healed, somebody comes along and tears them wide open again, forcing you to feel the pain again"
so depression really isnt <propmale> right cry staying up for  6 days no sleep finally have to drink myself to sleep no not really nothing right well guess what iv past depression  suicidal thoughts welcome back       crying  i hope u no its all ur fault and i hate u for what uv done to me and the worst part is u didnt warn me not one simple sign  fml
"~i'm so tired of being here, suppressed by all my childish fears\and if you have to leave, i wish that you would just leave\your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone\these wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real\there's just too much that time cannot erase~"
wow your an ass   ima keep drinkin my life away seems to be the only way i get over u and what u do         i drown myself in my misery     
for you id tear my self in two!!~ sad ~
"all the places i've been and things i've seen\a million stories that made up a million shattered dreams\the faces of people i'll never see again\and i can't seem to find my way home\cause it's almost like\your heaven's trying everything\to break me down\cause it's almost like\your heaven's trying everything\to keep me out~ali i love you for showing me this song     "
"itâ€™s not enough\itâ€™s not enough\it never was or will be\i never had the <propmale> to thank you\(for ripping out my heart)\itâ€™s not enough\itâ€™s not enough\it never was or will be\i never got the <propmale> to say\(fuck you)~5fdp"
"i have to block out thoughts of u so i dont lose my head\they crawl in like a cockroach leavin babies in my bed\droppin little reels of tape to remind me that im alone\playin movies in my head that make a porno feel like home\theres a burnin in my pride, a nervous bleedin in my brain\an ounce of peace is all i want for you  will you never call again?\and will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face?"
"silent night, let me sleep away these memories within\sacrifices of purity are turning into sins\and this judgement day is growing near\and this confession is killing me again\this beautiful tragedy is crashing into me\this dying destinee~in this moment"
"take your records, take your freedom  take your memories i don't need 'em  take your space and take your reasons  but you'll think of me "
"you want an honest answer, ok then  i'm not ok, i haven't been for a long time  as a matter of fact i want nothing more than, even on good days, to end my life "

"this beautiful tragedy, is crashing into me\this dying <propfemale>, take me away\this beautiful tragedy, come crashing into me\this dying <propfemale>\will you be there\will you be there by my grave\or will you be the death of me\and my, my beautiful tragedy"

"if it turns out to be what i think it is i won't be able to live with myself why does it have to e like this regret everything i have ever done since i have been fourteen:,( i really hate what's going on    "
"missing my bestest friends ever in this whole wide world i love you <propfirst> waters, <propfirst> human, autumn koepke, <propfirst> rockwood, and mikey layton lol smile "
im in love with <propfemale> <propfemale> <propmale> roncon lol
sometimes i ask my self how i'm still here after everything lifes put me through 
"play along  you're a serial killer  rules: go to your profile and look at your friends on the left side \1st person turns you in: <propfemale> cummins \2nd knows but doesn't tell anyone:autumn koepke \3rd is your partner in crime: <propfirst> waters\4th is your first victim: <propfemale> <propfemale> walker-ronco\   5th tries to kill you: <propfirst> human\6th is the police officer that arrested you:bryson maesch\7th is your lawyer: <propfirst> donahue"
"i seek strength, not to be greater than others, but to fight my greatest enemy, the doubts within myself"
i strive to do my best but everything i do is wrong or isn't good enough! when will i be good enough!
well got ready too soon and now nothing to doo  lol just trying to pass time nt going so well im not even tired wow thats gay lol so theres this certain person who well has been making my days worth smiling over and were hopefully talkiing and working stuff out today i honestly dont know what ill do though if i get rejected again i mean im not that bad well idk but i get to see my favorite cuzin ever mr  <propfirst> waters lol then hopefully seeing some old friends after school gonna be sweet
this classical music we are listening to makes us wanna msterbate    hard! laugh  but not hard enough to jizz though lol
"its hard know how hard your actually trying  whhy keep getting my hopes by being all its gonna be this day oh this day hopefully this day so im done im so tired of trying for the wrong people, why try anymore honestly "
"dear hole in my already broken heart,  after several failed attempts to climb out of you   would you do me a favor and just swallow me already??  thanks"
with the best person ever smile 
wow gonna be a great night 
someday ill prove to the world i know what love is but for now im going to start off by showing you smile 
honestly it seems like i did something wrong but the thing is i didnt do anything for you to act this way sad 
i love how everytime iv tried to tell you i even try to inerupt you and i still lose maybe it just wasnt meant for you and me maybe ill just let you be annoyed 
i hate the word love we over use it  always say it to fast  say it <propfemale> we really dont know what it is  and normally say it to a person we jumped into a relationship wow lets get really people 
"it's been a while, since every day and everything has felt this right and now you're turning all around and suddenly you're all i need   the reason why i smile"
"every time i try to talk to you, i get tongue-tied, it turns out that everything i say to you, comes out wrong and never comes out right "
whats the point in haveing family friends if they are their for others more than you just done with everything no one talk to me if you dont care honestly dropping the ones that dont matter 
"things are <propfemale>o different when i think of you, iv never smiled so much in my life my face feels like its stuck lol, and when i dont see you my heart feels incomplete and my throat has a lump in it as if im fighting back the pain in tears lol im afraid we wont go any furthur and i will lose you and that thought just crushes me i want you <propfemale> bad i love every second with you i <propfemale> every moment were together i love this feeling please dont let it go away smile "
"i dont know if ill make it, but watch how good ill fake it!!!!!=}"
lifes and everything is becomeing too overwhelming i have a feeling i cant do it anymore sad 
shakeing from the paain thats in my head just wanna crawl into my bed and throw away the life i lead but i wont let it die  but i wont it die but its over  its over  why is it over? we had the <propmale>  but its over   its over i wish that i could take it back  im falling apart  im falling apart dont say this wont last forever your breaking my heart your breaking my heart dont tell me that we will never be together we could be over and over we could be forever sad 
my tears run down like razor blades i know im not the one to blame its you or is it me? and all the things we never say come out now were all ashamed andtheres no sense in playing games when youve done all you can do now its over its over why is it over?
i was born to tell you i love you and i am torn to do what i have to make you mine stay with me tonight and i am tired of being alll alone and this solitary moment makes me want to come back home 
im not the only one for you but your the only one for me sad 
"i rather be anywhere, but here without you sad "
these wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just to real theres <propfemale> much that time can not erase sad 
"i will dry your eyes, i will fight your fight, i will hold you tight, and i won't let go ~rascal flatts~\if youd just give me the chance annoyed "
"i tried and tried and tried but i was still no good for you and honestly dont think i ever will be so why do i try for you still the simply thought that maybe it would happen but im heartbroken finally said id never let another person in again and i did said id never let another guy hurt me again and he did feel so heartbroken    again:,( why try anymore   "
what is communism?
the world become something i can't take my life is something i can't make
im sad sad 
i have never felt this way about anyone i know this is a real feeling for him all the others were just a practice round to teach me to protect my heart not to trust to easily to wait to rush things but see i actually feel for you but you don't want me i'm so serious iv may have said this about someone else but i got over them easily see i can't do that with you i want you <propfemale> bad more than iv ever wanted anything in my whole life but i'll never have you crying 
"what am i gonna do when the best part of me was always you\what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up and you're ok\i'm falling to pieces, yeah\cuz when a heart breaks no it don't break even:,("
just cant find a reason to smile anymore sad 
"well i finally decided to get out of bed and get around just dont feel like doing anything no motivation, i just dont care to do anything unless its with him  still cat find a reason to smile sad "
im falling apart im falling apart dont say this wont last forever your breaking my heart your breaking my heart dont tell me that we will never be together we could be over and over we could be forever 
"hmmm cant sleep but so not motivated for anything makes sense i guess whatever sso done with everything dont have a reason to smile so i dont have a reason to care sad \~~night everyone hope youve had a better night than me "
yeah i smile yeah i look happy when your around but once you turn your back you got me in tears 
if happiness is a bowl of cherries spread the jam!!! smile 
only smiling cuz i'm with the bestie love you <propfirst> human smile 
gonna dream a sweet dream but in the morning it will be nothing but a heartbreaking scene sad 
gonna have a good day hanging with him smile  tomorrow uproar with the family yay smile 
omg yesturdaywas freaking amazing escape the fate bfmv seether threedays grace avenged sevenfold and sevendust theey were amazin and <propmale> mabbitt is freaking awesome we talked for ever and his daughter was sweet ugh a hug and a cheek kiss absoluty to much and avenged sevenfolds performance was the best!!! downer of the day bruised ribs stupid people and their crazy ness hit me in the ribs
i'm broken crying 
its true when everyone says dreams dont come true and thats why were sleeping no one accomplishes anything sleeping  and happily ever afters were only made in stories  true love is only in movies and happiness is just a feeling that fades away like everything else because nothing last forever  and its just something we have to get over!
dont you love watching your life fall apart and you cant do a damn thing to stop it
