"got back late last night from table rock branson  had a great week at the condo just hanging out, playing miniature golf and other games  <propmale> caught dozens of fish and all the boys swam  had a nice day at silver dollar city  sdc does fall decorations the best! love it there  <propmale> rode wildfire (rollercoaster) for the first time   he was finally tall enough  they got me on powder keg   whoa    was that a ride!"
"cooked up one of benjamins turkeys today, made dressing too   yum! just a little warm-up for a thanksgiving feast next month, i guess "
"have some very sad news to share:  i'm grieving the news that my husband, <propmale>, has been diagnosed with advanced stage iv colon cancer   he has an inoperable tumor in his colon   it seems that the liver is very involved too   we are going in for radiation treatments on the colon tumor every day this week and will see another oncologist on thursday for more information on the liver "
we went to see the medical oncologist on thurs and they want to do some chemo to slow down the progression of the cancer they assured us that his side-effects would be minimal compared with the treatment of some of the cancers  still a little unsure about it all   he is so weak already  his weight is only 124#  (continued)
"happy 21st birthay, <propfemale>   looking forward to celebrating with you!!!  love you, li'l sis "
"68 yrs ago today, the japanese bombed <propfemale> harbor   tonight, we rewatched the <propfemale> harbor documentary that we bought at the arizona memorial in <propfemale> harbor gift shop two visits ago   still moving to watch   so thankful that god spared our nation even until now   may he raise up strong, capable, but most of all, godly leaders in our nation "
"praise god!kenny made it through surgery yesterday  the surgeon attempted to do a colon resection but wasn't able  instead she gave him a colostomy  he was in quite a bit of pain yesterday, but is feeling better this morning  he'll b getting a blood transfusion today-his counts are a little low he has a low fever, but the docs aren't too concerned about that  he'll b in the hospital (barnes west) for a few more days "
"after nearly a week, <propmale> is being released from the hospital today "
"crazy day   mom is in the hospital, concerned about her, a nurse is on her way to remove <propmale>'s abdominal staples today, working on a memorial video with <propfirst> for <propmale> gamel, laundry going-sort of-since the dryer isn't working yet, and we have to leave in two hours for the funeral home visitation   so glad i asked the lord this morning for his grace and strength today!"
a c is still down    hoping the repairman calls soon!  heat index was 102* yesterday   fans just don't seem to help enough when its that hot  i'm especially concerned about our terminally ill patient who is also suffering through the heat
