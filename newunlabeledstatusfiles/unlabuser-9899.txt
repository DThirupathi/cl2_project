"if you were waiting for a sign, this is it "
faut souffrir pour Ãªtre <propfemale>
regret is for people who have failed
we've got secrets for a reason
some people have impeccable timing  
this is my life  let me live it  thanks 
"i spend most of my life thinking about you and you and you, and all the people out there that i have not met yet and would like to if given the <propmale>  there must be thousands  it's a lot to think about "
"if you stand close enough, you can hear the ocean"
sometimes the things you're running away from can run pretty damn fast
"take me for who i am, not who i've been"
"\i don't really think he smells like christmas  he just makes me happy  that's it \"""""
it's kind of funny how the world can turn on a dime
"\you're just a backyard baby with a diaper full of dreams\"""""
may the bridges i burn light the way
"i am a super <propfemale>, i can fly and shit!"
"if the world is cold, make it your business to build fires "
"now i do as i please and i lie through my teeth  someone might get hurt, but it won't be me  i should probably feel cheap, but i just feel free    and a little bit empty "
"everything is as it's always been  this never happened  don't take it too bad, it's nothing you did  just once something dies, you can't make it live "
  because it's easier to love the rain and the smell of fresh coffee in the morning
"truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold  you push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough  you kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us "
live and let live 
"it's not because i've stopped caring, it's because you've stopped being a friend "
finally  smile 
don't e playful ect me to read your mind until you learn to read mine 
"if dignity were money, you could maybe buy a can of generic brand soda"
you've got no idea  smile 
"when there's nothing left to burn, you have to set yourself on fire"
"i am the lady from mars, and i can unscrew the stars"
vanishing made easy
i could use a spark  i could really use a spark 
"when you're alone in a crowd, hold on"
"i am peanut butter <propmale> road with multicolored sprinkles, hot fudge, and a <propfemale> on top "
thank you for unscattering me
"maybe i think you're cute and funny, maybe i wanna do what bunnies do with you, if you know what i mean "
you were just anchors tied to my ankles 
definitely sort of kinda loving my life    smile 
there's nowhere to go but on
"i shot for the sky, now i'm stuck in the clouds"
"the human body essentially recreates itself every six months, so no, i'm not the same as i used to be "
"i'm doing just fine, i'm always landing on my feet in the <propmale> of time and by the skin of my teeth "
i want to rip off your logic and make passionate sense to you 
"if you love large, you've got to hurt large  if you've got a lot of light, you've probably got an equal amount of darkness "
there is no wrong in wanting more 
and the emancipated soul rejoices 
 smile 
"we can grow five thousand roses in our gardens, but we still can't find what we're looking for "
e playful lanation would take the mystery out of it
you missed out on something lovely when you forgot about me 
"hey, you, dragging the halo  "
"anyone who can touch you can hurt you or heal you, anyone who can reach you can love you or leave you "
"if i didn't wake up tomorrow, what would you regret having kept from me?"
"you are my funny <propfirst>  sweet, comic <propfirst>  you make me smile with my he<propmale>  your looks are laughable, unphotographable, yet you're my favorite work of <propmale>  don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me  stay, little <propfirst>, stay  each day is <propfirst>'s day "
i see you flying 'round town with the bird i love and i'm like    pluck youu!
i'm choking on the words that have been stuck in my throat for months now  i'm just trying to keep them from spilling out 
don't miss out on what's happening now just because you're waiting for something better to come around 
"reality is a lovely place, but i wouldn't want to live there"
"this is life  not only the beautiful and blooming, but the morbid and lonely  it's all happening now, on this little speck of blue in outer space "
"i want to be like water  i want to slip through fingers, but hold up a ship "
"it all will fall, fall right into place  smile "
don't give a damn about you or this town no more
must be doin' something right
i make my shoes shine with my coal
"it never gets easier, you just get better "
can't help but love my life without effort sometimes   smile 
"i am the rain  the truth is i'm ruthless, i can't be contained "
"blessed are the broken, for they let the sun shine through "
it was the combination of god and chess pieces
hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour
"i'm so happy, 'cause today i found my friends  they're in my head "
"if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid "
life gets good  smile 
"<propfemale> rule for living: if it's not your business, don't ask questions "
someday you will die somehow and something's gonna steal your carbon
beauty without intelligence is a masterpiece painted on a napkin 
arkansas: you have two cows   that one on the left is pretty cute 
fill me up
"i'm feeling like a monday, but someday i'll be saturday night "
"even when it's hard to get up, do it anyways "
turns out you can't forgive everything
"when i'm good, i'm very, very good, but when i'm bad, i'm better"
this one isn't about you either
"if you keep sweeping it under the rug, you're gonna have one hell of a dust <propfemale> "
