happy valentines day!
i just love looking like a hot mess
it's nights like this that i miss you
"a rule to understanding me: you ignore me, i ignore you"
"hmmm   what to do, what to do"
"all my life i've been good, but now, i'm thinking what the hell? all i wanna do is mess around!"
well  that was disappointing  sad 
"what do normal people do when they're bored? im way too used to being busy, busy, busy with no time to spare!"
it's all of the little imperfections that make you absolutly perfect  smile 
"i am trying (very hard) to find a picture, and guess what?!?! i cant find it!"
why am i starving all the time?! i find it quite annoying   
"you can take me home, but im gunna drive  smile "
bowling with the girls  smile 
"there's the left side, and the right side, and then there's the truth   "
i don't respect guys whose jeans are tighter than mine
"if you are a track parent from fairfield, you are automatically hated courtesy of dacenport west girls track and field  smile "
i wanna get chocolate wasted! hahahahaha
i love storms!
