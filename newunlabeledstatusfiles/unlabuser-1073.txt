is wigged otu slightly    everyone's married    what happened? two years pass?
has five weeks left    crazy 
is trying not to count the calender    but he has 32 days if he was   
i leave for winnipeg in two weeks!
i'm going to be home on the 9th of july  pure insanity 
i am homeward bound! see you in 4!
has officially been an rm for about 24 hours 
i really should be in bed   
i watched the dark knight yesterday  it rocked 
avatar is a sweet movie  period 
"i'm hot  no, not like that    it's just insanely warm in my house right now   "
pondering the infinite complexities of the cosmos and where i fit in the grand scheme 
"i'm leaving for work  yes, at 1 in the morning "
"pondering the many twists and turns that life takes    the unusual paths we une playful ectedly find ourselves walking, and considering the ever present constant of change  the longer i live, the stranger and more intricately complex life becomes "
i just finished a 50 hour work week    i'm tired 
life is crazy  pure and simple 
i have decided that radio is evil    and mind numbingly boring  10 hour round trip drives to salt lake may be a contributing factor to the aforementioned conclusion 
why do we fall? so that we can learn to pick ourselves up 
22? feels just like 21 
"go to the brink and take a leap of faith, go to your limits and take one step further, rise above the breaking point and become everything you were meant to be "
taking a leap of faith into the unknown  just hope i land on my feet 
it's just been confirmed  i got the money to go back to school! suu here i come 
"just got back from church a little bit ago  college wards rock, in case you didn't know "
"i hate that everything in this world revolves around money  unless you're a buddhist monk from tibet, you have to accept the fact that the world is capitalist   "
"<propfemale> wertz just made me trunky for my mission  i didn't think that was possible, but i guess it is "
i'm not poor    i just don't have a lot of money  there's a difference  even if it's only in my head 
the greatest trials and battles of our lives often occur within the halls of our souls 
i've got a meeting with someone in the stake presidency this weekend  that's never good 
"hold to hope, find your faith, and whatever you do; don't let go "
"surrounded by people, but somehow feeling alone    making new friends, yet not quite feeling like i belong "
have you ever felt like your head might e playful lode with everything you've got on your mind?
"ok, huge favor to ask  anyone who has any digital copies or files of my book from two years ago, please send it to me via e-mail  some of my files have gotten lost, but i know there are complete copies in your inboxes, please double check for me "
just got called to be the executive secretary of my <propmale>    holy crap 
job hunting    it's like head hunting but not as fun 
i've got a date for wednesday  go figure 
i'm feeling giddy  in a totally manly way 
there is an innate danger in high hopes 
"learn to stand on your own two feet  when it really comes down to it, you can't count on anyone but yourself "
just got back from the long weekend  it was nice to have some time to decompress and get my bearings 
reasonable people are usually asleep by now    maybe i'll be semi-reasonable and go to sleep too   
somebody backed into my car today    thankfully the damage was minimal but still    no bueno 
my bishopric meeting tonight lasted 3 1 2 hours    that's more church than most people get on sunday 
homework    so much that it's leaking out my ears 
trying to get myself back into writing mode    i do it for fun believe it or not 
it's been about 70 degrees all day  that  is  awesome 
"i've been home from my mission for exactly two months today  i was in a contemplative mood and decided to post two poems that i wrote just before i came home  one might have more meaning to those who served in the cwm, but i think the sentiment is conveyed anyway  a huge thanks to everyone that helped me make it "
"it's the weekend, wahoo!"
i'm slowly    slowly    getting used to this whole rm being home thing  i might just make it after all  who knew?
"i have a tag again    i just got used to not wearing one  except this one says: <propmale> <propfirst> de water ccysa 2nd stake executive secretary 21st <propmale>  it's a bit more specific than my old one    granted it's only on sundays i wear it though  or anything \official\"" """
"this just happened in the library: a guy walked by wearing a pink wig, aviators, a tight white shirt with pink <propfemale> wings on his back and a pink mini skirt    i pray he lost a bet or something  welcome to suu   laugh "
i should be reviewing for <propmale> tomorrow    but part of me wants to watch a movie   
"i love the fact that i can read a batman comic book, and i'm doing homework at the same time  rock on "
i just realized that tomorrow is thursday    which means it's almost the weekend  sweet 
looking forward to the weekend!
"sometimes things don't go according to plan, sometimes it goes nothing like you had hoped    it's times like that you have to trust that no matter what, things will work out for the best  life always brings with it a few curves  it's how we take them that really matters "
halo reach: rocks  end of story 
"well, got my rental car this morning  a hyundai elantra  the big surprise was who came from enterprise to pick me up  i ran into my <propmale> <propfemale> nielson (lambert)  who would have known?"
i don't believe in coincidence  i have seen too much in life to believe that people and things cross our path out of sheer happenstance 
"i got my car back! whoo! it's as good as new  well, the bumper anyway "
trying to make sense of people even though i know that people don't make sense   
i write instead of sing  i paint pictures with words instead of brushes and tell stories that need to be told 
"essays, reading assignments, job applications, getting an american driver's license again, and church stuff    this is going to be a busy week "
there's only so much i can say about the odyssey and gilgamesh    it's hard to fit it into a four <propfemale> essay  it's just not that interesting in my opinion   
"sometimes you just have to roll with it, and hope that there's not a <propmale> nearby "
i had an interesting realization today  my whole life is in front of me  i'm free to make of it whatever i want  my course is the one i choose  nothing is set in stone 
"i don't feel like doing anything  i could be summed up as \meh\"" """
friendships are fragile  they can easily break if not handled with care 
it's rather wet and rainy outside today 
i just realized that i unintentionally lined up all my <propmale> bros  movies together  and that is my random fact for the day 
falling asleep in my chair trying to read medea    quite sad 
"it's still wet and rainy, which is cool  i have a <propmale> exam tomorrow which is not cool  no, there's no connection between the two  i'm just saying "
"i killed my <propmale> exam today  then i cooked it, chewed it up, and spit it back out  twice "
"just to clarify, i aced my <propmale> exam  i thought i was being clever, but a lot of people seem to think that i bombed the exam  i did quite well  mein professor was impressed "
it's friday  hallelujah 
when it's all said and done; life goes on 
i'm tired    and i'm afraid i may be getting sick    so i'm going to bed 
5+ hours of studying for a midterm today    and the dark knight  could be worse i guess 
oftentimes the greatest harm does not rise from harsh or angry words; but rather from apathy and indifference 
trying to take life one day at a time 
one week 
i'm keeping my fingers crossed that this job pans out 
trying to slug my way through this essay    so i can do some reading for tomorrow    so i can read plato for friday    i'm starting to think three english classes may be a bit much to tackle at once 
got the essay hammered out  finishing touches will be tomorrow  got a little bit of reading done  now the real question is    what do i eat for dinner?
i got the job! oo-rah!
do you trust to hope when reason says to abandon it? you hold to faith in a person when practicality says to walk away?
i honestly feel like i'm on the verge of snapping on something or someone  i've got a hundred things on my mind and the last thing i want or need is people second guessing me 
it's 37 degrees right now  i've seen -40  bring it on cedar 
<propmale> exam tomorrow    boo 
aced my <propmale> exam  even made my professor laugh 
i love the fact that illegal immigrants run all over the place without any legal documentation and still get government papers    but law abiding legal citizens get put through the bureaucratic meat grinder over simple things  it's a wonderful system 
pondering over what to do next   
it's friday    i could cheer  i'm doing a little <propfemale> jig in my head  mostly because i don't know how to do one in real life 
    yup 
why is it so stinking hard to find the run time on movie cases?
"here's the funny thing about a leap of faith    once you make the leap, basic physics says you live with the decision "
finding the right girl is kind of like looking for hay in a needle stack   
i've been hanging out with <propmale> <propmale> <propmale> all day    he'd probably be better company if he wasn't dead 
"learning to take life for what it is, accept it for what it's not, look forward to what it can be, and have the <propfemale> to be happy with it no matter what "
finished both of my four <propfemale> essays and am now fine tuning my presentation  proofreading  life just doesn't get much more exciting 
"there's snow on the ground here in cedar  last time i saw snow, i was in canada  crazy how time flies "
i've been home for 4 months as of today    that's just crazy 
"if people need an excuse to be your friend, then they aren't worth the time or effort in the first place "
i watched <propfirst> pilgrim last night  totally bizarre and totally awesome at the same time 
so we got about four inches of snow last night this morning  it really made me miss canada    just looking around at all the snow covered sidewalks brought back a lot of really good memories 
working on my book 
getting back into writing mode  it's a great feeling 
thanksgiving break starts in a week  oo-rah 
three days til thanksgiving break!
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, being a prick, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  they love you for who you are  re-post if you have at least one true friend  they will know who they are "
just finished the proof read of the rough draft for phoenix spire  now the fun begins: the re-write!
all the snow reminds me of winnipeg    that and the last time i was dealing with snow on my car    i was also wearing a suit 
out of school  for the week  and deathly hallows was awesome 
pushing forward because the only other option is going back 
happy december everybody!
at this point    tired is an understatement 
i haven't quite resorted to selling organs for money    but i'm close 
the re-write begins 
buckle up folks  it's finals week at suu 
paper's done  woohoo!
i think i need a new flash drive    1 gb just doesn't really cut it these days 
american lit final today    here's to hoping 
"two finals down  one more to go, then it's home for the holidays!"
done with finals! i'm headed home for the holidays!
i had a completely lazy day today  it was awesome 
"it's almost christmas, woohoo!"
