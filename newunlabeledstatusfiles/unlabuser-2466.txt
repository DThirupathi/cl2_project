"i want to be president when i grow up, so i too can spend money i don't have "
why do we screw up the things that mean the most to us?
"we love what we love  reason does not enter into it  in many ways, unwise love is the truest love  anyone can love a thing because  thatâ€™s as easy as putting a <propfemale> in your pocket  but to love something despite  to know the flaws and love them too  that is rare and pure and perfect "
"your past constantly vies for control of your future, but at the end of the day you have a choice  at any time you can decide to be the master of your <propfemale>, rather \than a victim to your past  your new beginning can begin today "
a man has only one escape from his old self: to see a different self in the mirror of a woman's eyes

some people don't realize what they have until it's gone  and some don't even then   
you are the choices you make 
the most valuable thing in the world is time  it's the only thing you can't get back so don't waste it on people that aren't worth it

"your daily horoscope - aries\changes to your primary relationship are coming, changes that will bring rewards and opportunities to you both  keep your eyes open for changes involving people you have worked with in the past  while some of these relationships will be challenging, the ultimate changes will be good "

"you can not change the past  just learn from it, move forward, and try to atone for your mistakes "
good morning everyone

there are some people you wish you never met and some people you wish you met sooner 
about to go to the river to bbq and go swimming  but i still can't get away from work  have to take a call at 3  ugh!
why would anyone ever get into a relationship knowing they don't want it? why tell someone you love them when all you really want is to be single and sleep around? can someone please e playful lain that to me?
"you wouldn't believe it, if you seen it  i watch the skyline light up every evening  its like i'm dreaming  baby what i mean is, most of ya'll don't know that this my world "
