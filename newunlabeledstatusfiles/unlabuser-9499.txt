eminem: the way i am    one of the best books i've literally every started to read and i hate books
might not be time to go back to work yet after spending time on the lake for a few days but it sure does feel like it 
back to the point where i wonder if its even worth it 
"sometimes i am convinced people can't think logically    or read  then i stand there asking myself \why me?\"" the simple and stupid failures make our lives harder    it's getting old """
seriously miss the <propfirst> y days
really saints? you give up bush    i hope miami wins it all with him at the helm for it
u of m qb vs  u of m qb  welcome to who has the better o line cause we know its not the qb getting the job done

time to start looking before i have no choice 
"finished  without a doubt, i cannot do this anymore  this is all so political and stupid and a conversation with someone tonight helped me realize     i'm done being frustrated with my life because of the things i go through at work "
if you had to pick a restaurant that was the most similar to <propfemale>'s what would it be? not how much you like the food but the overall type of restaurant?
apparently the woman that used to live in my apartment is convinced i stole a bag of clothes her friend from california dropped on the front door  little creeped out by the whole thing 
"i feel like a lot was accomplished today  and it was even with \beta\"" in the building  i'll credit it to the slow sales and good staff """
"and let it be known from this day forward\i wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength\so let em bicâ€™s raise cause i came with 5â€™9? but i feel like iâ€™m 6â€™8?"
i've had the conversation several times with different people but i still wonder how people go through life accepting the fact that they are terrible at their jobs     or if they even realize?
thanks for the great 5 years  it has been my pleasure    unfortunately it was about 3 too many
