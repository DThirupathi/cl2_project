"enough to hold you to the brightest of lights, \to place you dangerously close to that sun, \enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore \and recognize the cause of what's done is done, \more than enough to put my name behind my ideals, \and neglect my logic twice daily  \enough to keep me looking for my <propfemale> in the sky with gems, \when i remember how you used to call me baby,"
"enough to look in my mirror with detest for every tear you shed regardless of \\why you wept, \\enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth of the ocean i swam \\till i ran out of breath  \\i love you, don't ever fucking question that, \\that's why we'll probably never get along "
my world is changing  i hope my good friens will be there with me
