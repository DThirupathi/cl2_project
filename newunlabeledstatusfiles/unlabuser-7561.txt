just spent 3 hours in the emergency room with <propfemale> to find out she has a virus  did you know that 7 out of 10 flu tests will have a negative result but that doesn't necessarily mean you don't have the flu????
"and did you know that a rapid result strep test can be negative but you could still be infected   if you are lucky, they can throw in a throat culture (just for shits and giggles) but it takes 24 to 48 hours to get the results and if that tests positive, then you might get a perscription "
