"conversations with will) me: will (who laying against my arm), you feel warm  will: yeah, that's 'cause i was swimming in the cold water  and cold water makes me warm  and hot makes me cold  and that's just the way it is  now, who can argue with that logic!"
"back on land after a fantastic disney cruise  total sea mileage: 249,120nm "
