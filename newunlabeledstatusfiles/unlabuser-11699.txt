something comes from nothing    if you're willing to believe    because everything has meaning    everything we see    are you willing to give up    everything?
what hurts the most    was being so close    and having so much to say    and watching you walk away

"mice: (n) pandimensional superbeings that manifest themselves to humans as cheese-obsessed rodents  commissioned the creation of earth to find out what the question of life was, and why the answer was 42 "
"why do we let it out of control? has all this taken a toll?    i don't know if we can take anymore    we've got to stop and take a look in the mirror before    step back, take a look inside yourself    from the outside, you can see someone else staring back at you    it's your reflection"
what hurts the most  is being so close  and having so much to say  and watching you walk away  and never knowing  what could have been  and not seeing that loving you  is what i was trying to do

"as of late, i have had to enstrange some people for the sake of sanity  yet i still wonder why? is it really that hard for you to act civilly towards me? i haven't done anythng to either of you to deserve this  am i really such a horrible person that you can't stand to let me hold madi's hand, that you have to come between us? i must say, it has only worked on a physical level  spiritually, it has drawn us closer "
"i just wish my parents realized that what they ask of me is, indeed, unreasonable  1 week to do 2 late lab reports and 4 other missing assignments is unreasonable  and it would be a bit more bearable if i was getting a bad grade  but, i have a b! just let me study for finals!"
