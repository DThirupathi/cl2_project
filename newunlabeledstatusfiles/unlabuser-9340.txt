"please read and repost!!! warning: there is a video circulating around facebook of a bbc video of the killing of osama bin laden, supposedly made by us troops  it is a virus!!!!! spread the news because it's circulating fast!!!!"
it makes me nervous that everyone is celebrating bin laden's death  dont get me wrong - i know a lot of people were lost and their loved ones still hurt over it  and then theres all the deaths that happened since - all the military and civilians killed  that proves that hate just multiplies  they will take revenge as we did and it creates a vicious circle  will it ever stop or will this be the beginning of the end??
"it's been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been, or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy and you will always love them  repost if you have at least 1 of these friends!"
happiness is a choice! it is a choice we make in our hearts  you can <propfemale> on to old hurts and be miserable or you can make a choice to let it go    choose to be happy!! xoxox  love
