"you might've heard i run with a dangerous crowd   we ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud   "

so i had a store call in because they had a customer return a diva cup    which is nasty enough but the story was worsf! they went to the dr  to get it out & returned it with a dr  note! if you don't know what a diva cup is google it you'll see the ick!!
nothing from <propmale>'s lawyer yet   wonder if that means he came to his senses or is just waiting til the last minute?
well <propmale> got ahold of a mediator    i wonder if it means he's ready to talk or if its the first step toward court and he wants to put on a show   
is today over yet? heading to <propfemale> tonight with the first load of stuff    and no kids!!!
sleepy!!!!
<propfirst> called this am with an  interesting statistic   did you know 6 out or 7 dwarves are not happy? - ok that proves it my boyfriend is a geek!

feeling even more intolerant of stupid people than usual    and we all know what a sweet tolerant girl i generally am!
everytime i think about everything i have to do in the neyt 4 wks i get totally overwhelmed! i guess i need to make a point of not looking at the whole picture and break packing into little steps

ok so i don't have to kill her    she found her phond    in her damn backpack    after i asked if she bothered to clean it out to be sure it wasn't there! maybe this was enough of a scare to whip her into shape!
while i was making supper reilly out of nowhere comes out and sits in the middle of the floor with her feet together pulled in close and starts ohmmm-ing! i laughed so hard i couldn't even ask where that came from!!
