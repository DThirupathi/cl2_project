"insists that the uranium is just for    \parties\""   honest """
laughs at the 27% of americans who still support obama - maybe it's for his 'bi-partisanship' or 'fiscal responsibility'   
"victimizes the illogical, preys on the mentally unprepared   (aka enjoys his philosophy class)"
", contrary to popular opinion, thinks that heraclitus neither contradicts himself nor uses it as an illustrative method "
weeps at the fact that the us income is around $3 trillion and the new budget is $4 5 trillion    t_t
hates learning about all the chemical equations involved with geo-chemical weathering   
is really missing the video game bunch in the lobby    that and getting tired of all the spammers online
used a firearm for the first time yesterday    and loved it!  thank you us weapon laws!
"musing of the day    ironic how, despite the labels of 'conservative' and 'liberal', the sides keep changing   the end result is that obama supporters have 'changed' the country, but that 'change' is now status quo!  in other words, they are now the bitter conservatives protecting the status quo (56% of americans)  while the 'conservatives' are actually advocating change!  funny, right?"
finished a critique on aristotle's virtue theory    there were no survivors 
is as he once was twice again!
"wishes there were a truly great rpg to play     xiii has an excellent battle system,  but story is cliche and characters are weak    xii was pretty bad all around (perhaps little better than x-2)    i'm thinking ffx was the best final fantasy created "
"not one republican voted for the health care <propmale>    if it succeeds, the democrats will get all the credit    if it fails, they had better get all the blame   so much for bi-partisanship (both sides)"

"a pessimist only sees the dark side of the clouds, and mopes an optimist doesn't see the well he is about to fall into because he is admiring the beauty of the sky   a philosopher sees both sides and shrugs"
pet peeve: i wish people would stop saying the term 'hispanic' without understanding what it means   hispanics are those people who can trace their ancestry back to spain (and europe) without native <propfemale>n blood who came to <propfemale> on the original conquests or were children of the original spanish colonists of the new world   it is a huge cultural insult to hispanics to call mexicans and latinos 'hispanic'

"well, the irony is this: two weeks after he removed the ban on offshore drilling, the worst oil spill in us history happens   this combined with the pathetic government response (they had oversight of all operations)    obama is to blame for one of the biggest us environmental disasters in history "
