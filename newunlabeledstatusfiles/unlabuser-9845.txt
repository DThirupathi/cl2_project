"i'm tearing away, pieces are falling and i can't seem to make them stay "
"now if you would've waited one second,you wouldn't feel so second  the second i put you first,it made the situation worse "
i love having really bad allergy symptoms and having no idea what it is that i could possibly be allergic to  i feel awful
