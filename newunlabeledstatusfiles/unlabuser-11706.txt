i'd like to think that in an alternate reality the boondock saints killed osama or aided in killing him 
1 final down 1 more today and 2 more to go later in the week 
little over 6 days to go   damn you soc 105 for having the final on the last day    
"i don't know why but i'll say it's too late, i don't want to give up but i've given in, if i keep going i'll just begin to stop, and yet i look only to see that i am blind   "
"still can't wait to get back, i see some good times ahead for this summer "
so i might not be a bio <propmale> anymore    but i won't know till all my finals are in   
"2 days to go   and i'm going to continue on in bio till i decide otherwise since i passed organic chem 1 i'm feeling pretty good   but i'd still rather be home partying it up with all my good friends, not to say i won't miss my friends here "
