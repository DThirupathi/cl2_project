had a great day with my wonderful husband on his birthday !
i played the best joke on my kids today  i pretended to hide the eggs and had them come out and look for them but really i put them back in the fridge  after about 15 minutes of them searching for the eggs and not being able to find them i gave in and showed them where the eggs were  that was our payback for all the pranks they played on us for april fools    lol !   happy easter !

had a great time at the circus with my man and lil men    smile  now its back to work tomorrow
