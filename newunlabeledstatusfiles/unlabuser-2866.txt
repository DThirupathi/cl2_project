"has got a motivation problem, so my standard break from life is getting longer "
is torn between looking forward to another drunken saturday night and dreading another hungover sunday morning  standard dilemma in the life of <propfemale> 
"had no idea her ipod was so smart: north of <propmale> it plays alkaline trio, the dear & departed, and the ataris, and south of <propmale> it plays t i  and akon  well played, ipod (quite literally) "
": salty, sweet, and drunk "
got her ass smacked by <propfirst> <propfemale> hosey in bed last saturday night    just so we're all clear 
"is on the el and just watched an extremely awkward, approximately 15 year old boy pull a disembodied <propfemale> leg out of his pants pocket  not really sure why this is surprising, really "
forgot her phone at home again today  such a winner 
just got to leave work early because the ceiling in her office caved in  knew there was something wrong with today   
"is wishing one of her favorite people, miss <propfemale> say, a very, very happy birthday "
"is now looking at 3 days off in a row and still has no feedback on this last thesis draft  no feedback = nothing productive to do  if i am a total waste of life between now and thursday, i am blaming it entirely on dr  <propfirst> <propmale>  tell all your friends "
"has only one thing to say: \cubs fans are 90% scar tissue \"" sigh  so true """
"was going to be really frustrated by the cubs-pirates game being on a (no) rain delay, but as it turns out, the big ten network is playing the illinois-indiana game from march 5th of 1989  when one door closes, another opens!  smile "
"is thinking, five cubs homers in one game - including d  <propfirst>'s career 300th - on the same night that the blackhawks bring home the <propmale> cup?! finally, some evidence that god being a chicago fan wasn't just a thing of the '90s   wink "
just realized that this is the last week of the first quarter century of her life  ugh 
"is definitely watching <propmale> leary live, rubbing his nipples  while he ridicules the catholic church and father's day  happy almost-birthday to me "
"is back from e-town, trying to make peace with the idea of being 25   smile  thanks to everyone for all the birthday wishes!"
"is thinking that a storm knocked out my superpowers, now i sleep through thundershowers - wake me when you learn to be cool  if i'm the captain of this boat, then all my shipmates are fools and all the stars in the world couldn't help me steer my way out of this kiddie pool "
