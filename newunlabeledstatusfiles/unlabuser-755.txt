i hate when people lie about the stupidest things    actually i hate liars in general  but it particularly irritates me when people involve me in their lies to any degree and also when the lie is unnesesary or stupid  do some people lie just to lie? or perhaps they enjoy trying to wreak havoc even in the smallest of ways 
thinks its funny how amaya has no interest in half her toys until i empty out her toy box to sort out things to put away for the new baby  all of a sudden she wants to play with toys she hasnt even picked up in a year

"random deep thought of the day: isn't it funny when we are blessed with something when we are young, we mistake it as power, and we wield it against others? how many people do you know who are pretty, or strong, or are natural born leaders really use their blessing for good?"
