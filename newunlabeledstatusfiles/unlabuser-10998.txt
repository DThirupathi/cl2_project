i wish you were here with us dad you put a smile on everyones face 
"can't decide, then look at the faces(candle light)\we are burning the pages(ask us why)\and hurting ourselves with this false start\and we pretend(resign yourself to always be)\as if it gets easier(without the one thing you need )\but does it get easier?(creating words with no replies)\when we have these morning where we can't say goodbye "
"there's not much you could do or say to phase me\people think i'm a little bit crazy\i get it from all angles in a while to save me\to make me stop and think about it 'fore i just say things\sometimes i forget what other people just may think"
