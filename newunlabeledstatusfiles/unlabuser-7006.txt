"i know life sucks when playing guitar can't help me feel better  sad \maybe it really is time to just give up on trying to be the person i used to be   maybe its time to just let go, and become someone different, whether or not i'll be someone better is still unknown to me, but i'll try to make the most of it"
"well, im gonna try something different, instead of just playing guitar, im gonna try to write a song   lets see how well that goes"

"hahaha, thank god i can always count on this amazing person called <propfemale> to make my day better   to make all my troubles just float out the window and leave me alone for a while   long enough for me to feel a little bit better  thank you <propfemale>!!! you're the best!!!  laugh "
"well, life pretty much sucks right now   oh well, i still had fun hanging out with <propfemale>, <propfirst>, <propfemale>, and jessica   and i learned not to get a ride from <propmale> if i don't want any injuries   over all it was a good night, now to think about all my problems and ways to solve them"
