how can your heart have feelings for someone your mind says you dont know? all i know is i have never missed strangers so much 
"some days are rough, some days are smooth, but every day is an opportunity "
"5 days, 6 basketball games, tired, cut, bruised, beaten, black eye, sore all over, knee pain, and much more         i have missed this feeling so much  smile "
if youâ€™re late to something then your tardy   if youâ€™re late again then youâ€™re retardy   if referring back to the first your tarded   but if referring to the second then your retarded   so if youâ€™re late twice or more to the same thing   your retarded
