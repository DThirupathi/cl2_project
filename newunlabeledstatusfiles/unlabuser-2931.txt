"you never know what you have until it's gone    i recently lost my grandpa  we were not close, but i wish i'd taken the oppurtunity to tell him that he meant more to me than just a 50$ <propmale> on my birthday every year  alwaays make sure you let your loved ones know you care, because you never know when you'll have that oppurtunity taken from you "
hazzah!!!!
"okay, let's get something straight here i didn't quit school b c i'm pregnant, no i don't cut myself  i had to make a really difficult choice and i had to give up some things that meant the world to me  don't say crap about mads being better now i'm not in it  i have enough insecurities without you making me feel like i can't do the one thing i ever felt even remotely good at!"

"well, i found it  it's smudged and scratched, but at least it still plays  unfortunately the turds i put up with have absolutely no respect for anything belonging to me "

"until you know what it's like to want to die, really want to die, don't you say another word about it being the easy way out  until you are in the worst pain a human being could ever suffer don't even think it  suicide is not the easy way out  when something happens to you that makes you want to put a gun to your head you feel free to say something about it  until that day, you had best keep your mouth shut "
i'm so mad > sad 
when i'm alone i feel so much better and when i'm around you i don't feel   
"how would one go about getting copious amounts of nail polish out of heavily textured carpet after they have already tried dousing it with nail polish remover, resolve and going over it with a carpet cleaner?"
is honesty really so much to ask for?
sigh  i miss <propmale> wiggle  <propfirst> is dumb  i haven't been this disappointed since <propmale>'s retarded brother <propfirst> took over blue's clues   
i know i have a lot to be grateful for  i just forget sometimes

"i'm sick of people treating me like i'm stupid  i made some not do great choices  i didn't go to the classes that i didn't want to go to  it really hurts my feelings that people still bring up the fact that i dropped out  i made that choice, i don't need to be reminded of it  i realized how stupid it was and i'm getting my diploma a little bit late  when you are perfect, feel free to blame me for my mistakes "
understand what i've become    it wasn't my design  and people everywhere think i'm something better than i am

i should be getting ready for work right now    but i'm not 
i think i might murder my co worker  it would be well worth the prison time   
i just want to go to sleep and wake up and have everything be ok for once 
i hate how when i dont want to talk about it everyone wants to talk to me about it  and when something really is wrong no one is there to talk about it 
"swallowed up in the sound of my screaming, cannot cease for the fear of silent nights  oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming, the goddess of imaginary light   "
