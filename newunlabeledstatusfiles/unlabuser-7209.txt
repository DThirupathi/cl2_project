"i liked the old tmnt better   the 2003 version actually has a story, but mikey is the only funny one   the 1987 turtles had a lot of cute puns    and the toddler turtles~ love "
"i guess the real problem with the 2003 tmnt is <propmale>, especially his voice   it's all deep and un-yakko-y   and 2003 raph is meanish   and to my knowledge, hasn't been portrayed as an adorable 5-year-old   it's funny   i don't like the old mikey, but the new one is the only character that i like better "
"study island is very stupid, at least for science   i have given up on it "
