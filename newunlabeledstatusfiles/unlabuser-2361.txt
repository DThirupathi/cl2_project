"my wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure but acceptance and understanding about what challenges they face        93% of people won't copy and paste this, will you be one of the 7% that does and make this your status for at least an hour "
"ok so, whoa!  picked my <propfirst> up, came home, met everyone (sighing greatfully because everyone is still alive), had dinner just the 2 of us at risky's, and then, i went to a bar!  for the first time!  it was more than awesome "

"omg     so, we had 2 baby birds living in one of our vents, that took 2 hours to get out   once we got them out, one took off but the second one can't fly!  we put the bird in a box in the garage, and my son that is deathly affraid of birds unsuspectingly open the box and just about had a heart attack   hilarious!"
omg i hate downtown traffic!!!
"ok, so took <propfirst> to see the eye dr this morning     got some good and bad news   his eyes aren't getting any better, but they aren't getting worse   dr said he will probably never need glasses which is awesome!!  but, he does need surgery to adjust the muscles around his eyes   oh well, one more thing to do i guess!"
"ugh!  not only do we have to do eye surgery for <propfirst>, but we also get to do tubes for sister, and a new set of tubes for <propfirst>   gotta love surgery  surprise p"

"hopefully, this kid will pass out soon!  i have to be up and be at work at 8:45 in the morning, and he's being dumb "
"whoa   got my schedule and they have me working a lot!  like 30 hrs a week!  it's awesome, but i was hoping to move most the stuff to the house and get that situated!  oh well, all things come with time!  just means i should have some extra money for all the little things i need to live comfortable, along with some of the big things i will have to invest in "
"ok, so second day on the job, and it's going pretty well   i'm scheduled to work tomorrow for a few hours, but i'm going to spend the rest of the day out at the house trying to put stuff where it goes   hopefully we will be totally in by this next weekend   cross ur fingers!"
happy birthday <propfemale> <propfemale> wright! welcome to the madhouse we call life  congrats <propmale> n <propfemale> we love u guys!
"congrats to all the northwest grads,but especially <propfirst> n <propfemale>! u guys finally made it! now on to the next chapter! o by the way, reality is a beach that's not always <propfemale>!"
"busy, busy!  stormie made it through surgery just fine, but <propfirst>'s was rescheduled  surprise p o well!  trying to keep up with school, working 30+ hours a week, dealing with kids and living life is keeping me on my toes   sry to all that i haven't gotten a <propmale> to talk to the past couple days!  i still love u!   love  mwah!"
"fact of life   after monday & tuesday, even the calendar says w t f !!"
"well, memories, they're over-rated annoyed all they do is get you down an' frustrated,\and who needs that on their back?\starting over, cold turkey,\washin' your soul of everything that's dirty \seal your heart of every crack"
"how are you gonna fall if you don't take that leap\you live in fear, fear of lovin' me\and i'm givin' up, i'm givin' up on you\because you'll never change and\givin' your heart away is one thing you won't do"
is confused    i'm not sure why i'm confused but i am confused about being confused    and that makes me more confused    is that confusing or what?
"thank god for days off, and good mornings with my boogers!  took the kids outside this morning and had a picnic on their picnic table, (gotta love lunchables! lol) thought about doing bubbles n stuff with um outside, but stormie doesn't like the stickers  surprise p  i think i'm gunna make a trip to the store and buy washable finger paint and do inside stuff with them til it's cool enough to mow (again, some more)"
the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible
"don't allow others to drive you crazy, when you know it's within walking distance!"
"don't want to read the paper or turn on the news\don't want another helpin' of the same old blues\don't want to call nobody or answer the phone\what i want is everybody to leave us alone\let us sit down in the porch swing sip a little ice tea\play with the kids in the yard\it's time to get lazy had enough crazy\life ain't gotta be so hard"
"hold your head high \don't ever let 'em define\the light in your eyes \love yourself, give them hell \you can take on this world \you just stand and be strong\and then fight\like a girl \oh, with style and grace\kick ass and take names"

"ok, so i got off facebook 8 hrs ago   and, i've been awake for about an hour   i'm back to not sleeping again!  ugh!!  i guess i'll just start my day way early today and hope noone minds that i'm dragging by 5!"
don't mistake kindness for weakness nor silence for stupidity   i keep my distance not out of fear or bitterness but because of contentment  i'm happy where i am!
"all electronics will be turned off tonight! about to start cooking dinner now, and won't be back til after it's done!! it's family night cuz my kids need some serious me time!"
"ok, so all my electronics are being shut off as of now! dinner is started so i'm going to read a cookbook with the kids til we figure out what to make for dessert! have a good night all!"

"i'd rather know and be disappointed, then not know and always wonder "
yogurt story with my little bro today  i'm glad we had a few to catch up! been missin him! now i'm home with my babies gettin ready for some much needed sleep!
the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible 
"four things that can never be recovered: the stone after it's thrown, the word after it's spoken, the occasion after it's missed, and the time after it's gone "
silence is golden   duct tape is silver   an old shovel is bronze   take your pick
ugh! my kids hinder so much  need to figure something else out cuz this blows

"i've already fallen\i've already lost control\i've already missed \and i've already sold my soul\and i've already cried\and i wish that i was flying     \but i keep on falling"
"clocking in to start yet another long night  so much on my mind, hopefully it'll help me stay awake!"
