studying for my final   i'm feeling pretty good about this   although that feeling in the past always meant that i did horrible   we'll see  smile 
"so i officially passed my first semester of nursing clinicals   i'm so happy  laugh   and i'm soooo thankful for christmas break, i can hardly hold in my pee "
"i heard the train whistle ringing in the mystery of this celebrated day  the mystery of how one man could cause a commotion in all lives of the world, one life could be the greatest butterfly effect of all, one child could sear himself into the hearts of anyone looking for someone greater than themselves   how he could have changed my life   changed the direction, motivation, and purpose of it   how did this happen?"
yet another christmas i'd like to forget   
"curling up with some hot coffee, christmas cookies, and bones season 2   oh yeah, and my school work for the winter break "
why can't there be a college that offers a sleeping degree?
and the school work over break continues   will i have a life at all when the semester actually starts?
i just burnt a pancake because i was one facebook instead of in the kitchen and now my entire apartment smells like albino squirrels sizzling to their death   such is life

"trying not to get pissed off by the interuptions and text messages friends and family keep sending me today    i have to study!!!  unlike most college courses, i have a total of 326 points for the entire semester   which means i can only miss 80 points and pass   and they don't give out extra credit or bonus points "

i officially hate my life as related to school!!!!!!!!!
i'm pretty much hating on facebook right now   it's really sucking   it may actually drive me to myspace once again   
wishing i was doing something productive riht now instead of nothing at all   
feeling the weather right now   and knowing i have to work tonight doesn't help me mood   
studying for my test on monday   and hoping something sticks!
i wish being ripped in two tickled   i'd much rather laugh right now
i have been blessed by friends and family that can see the hand of god more clearly than me when my eyes have been shaded with emotions   there is no greater evidence our my god than his voice heard through the mouths of his people 
if i could give up any part of my body and still live it would be my heart 
sitting in my apartment listening to latino music from my mexican neighbors   takes me back to the nights in mexico   i miss that place so much
and the healing has begun   
so i've decided that if i don't pass this semester i'm not going back to school   i don't know what i'll do but i'm done with hacc   the york faire's coming upand carnies always fascinated me   
when will this nightmare end!!!!  and when will i stop hating everything!!!
wonders if my patient is still alive or if i was one of the last people in this world to hold his hand   
in the midst of the storm through the wind and the waves and when the stars refuse to shine and time is no more    you'll still be faithful   
preparing for a wedding this weekend!!!!  can't wait!!!!

"for some strange reason, i'm in the mood for silly romance movies   too bad i have to work"
i wish i could offer more   i wish i could hold onto you until the darkness was over   i wish i could walk through this valley for you   i wish i didn't have to sit back and watch you hurt   
wow <propmale> and i should be banned from spending time together  we always end up doing something crazy   
"\why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?\""  love that movie smile """
<propfemale> on!  this is not a journey for the weak and feeble minded   
"that's it i'm done! you've slapped me in the face enough  if you wanted me to remember, i have  if you wanted me give up, i have  if you wanted me to not be me anymore, well i'm barely me now so congrats  do with me what you will "
feeling september   
"three more days of clinical, two weeks of school, one test and one final to go before it's summer    then i may disappear for some time "
"why do i always want to sleep?  i dreamed of sleeping last night, it's sad "
"can't sleep, too much on my mind   "
"wow, i have been blessed with the most amazing small group iin the world   thank you for the joy in the darkness abba   "
"\so what happens when the heart just stops stops caring for anyone the hollow in your chest dries up and you stop believing   \"" thanks glen smile """

last day of school before the final   i'm so happy laugh 
i should be studying but i'm not  i could be working out but again    i'm not  bad me smile

"rest with your husband and your savior now, aunt <propfemale>   you were an amazing woman who left your impression on everyone you met   i'll miss you "
"i'm blessed by the people in my life who are building me into the woman i am meant to be and humbled by the knowledge that i still have a long way to go   i have a vision of that woman that will not be crushed or broken   i know my strengths and weaknesses, and i know the value i have in christ   no matter the future, i will finish strong "

"i've never felt so ordinary, so e playful endable, so overlooked as i do right now "
and life makes room for one more   my uncle died yesterday and i'll have a new nephew born today   it's like a bitter sweetness in a way   a happy sadness   
"after getting to meet my new nephew, i'm off to the gym   i promise pictures will be posted soon smile   welcome to the world baby <propfirst>!"
watching lord of the rings   for the next several days smile 
"so now i don't feel safe being at home alone   or leaving alone, or coming home alone   this sucks"
"and another horrible day down the tubes   i figure, if i get them all out of the way now then i won't have any later in life   "
"i've decided to become a boy  it seems as though my talents, personality, and spiritual gifts would have all been better gifted to a man  and as a woman, they're only getting me in trouble  so i'm going to fix what should have been fixed before i was born  and maybe in the process i'll discourage this stalker of mine as well "

after giving it several years to grow on me i can now safely say    still hate the book of acts   
"there are days when i feel like going into some secluded woods, driving nails into my fingers and toes, and calling it a good time would be preferable to dealing with the crap at work   today was one of those days    sad "
i really feel like beating something  now if i only knew where that guy lived   
going to the movies with <propfemale>!!!!
"\death is not a failure of medical science but the last act of life \"" -patch adams m d """

"heart broken, angry, compassionate, sorrowful, grieving, disgust, sadness, hatred, sick, upset, frustrated, regretful, prayerful, surprised, and numb   that's how i feel   \\and yet in all of this i find peace   "
i passed!!!!
picking up the broken pieces    once again
a bitter sweetness  i passed my test    and there's very little joy in it
so i'm taking my nieces and nephew to see tangled today  by myself  they're all under the age of 5  i may come out of this e playful erience a changed person  anyone know if insanity is in my family?
"dear god, i need my special dream tonight  i need peace and i can't seem to find it awake  so give me my dream and keep the feeling lingering into tomorrow "
"hiding out, watching movies, and avoiding family   "
"feeling better, i love it when god comes down to pick me up after i've been stumbling around in the dark like my blind, diabetic dog does when my mom rearranges the furniture   "
it has happened to me again  i have been gnomed     arggg   <propfirst> you are so cunning!

surreal moment   just applied for graduation    
and i have off of school tomorrow    all that studying for nothing     smile 
"and hacc once again has proven their insanity by canceling school but not clinicals   because apparently driving to school is far too dangerous of a trip but going to hershey for clinicals is a piece of cake   especially the drive home tonight   at 9   if i don't make it home,  you all know i loved you   "
finding peace among the chaos  wondering where this pattern god is weaving in me will lead  and praying that what time i am afraid i will put my trust in thee 
enjoyed some fun with a friend tonight   apparently i am 44 according to the wii   
so i've decided to change my political affiliation   anyone know of any good parties that will never have a <propmale> at winning an election?
reading <propmale> miserab<propmale>    and letting marius pontmercy be the lead in my dreams

playing my guitar and worshiping until 5 am  couldn't have ended in a better way smile 
"sick  stomach virus  seriously there are times when i feel like god is trying to tell me i won't be graduating this semester, today was one of them   "
"if i could change something about my past, it would be one moment   ten years ago "
there are times in life where you meet someone for maybe just a brief moment and they change your world smile   thanks m c 
i got soaked through   but it was still a good run tonight

can't sleep    again  this is getting old 
"i remember when i was a kid i used to go out into the back yard and look for bugs under rocks or in dark, cool areas  i loved playing with them and picking them up  i think the animal kingdom is trying to do me a favor  instead of me going out to find the bugs, nature's bringing the bugs to me    i miss the good old days   "
i need to give a massage
