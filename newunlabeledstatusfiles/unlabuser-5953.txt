back from the va  glad i am off work tommorrow 
happy fourth everybody 
going to bed now  one of my fav docs has a long day for me tommorrow  hope he appreciates it 
nothing like a 14 hour work day to make you rethink your career choices  nite all 
"my daughter <propfemale> was in a car accident today  she is in the trauma stepdown unit at vanderbilt now  she has a post trauma concussion, a small laceration on her forehead and hairline fracture on her pelvis  i have never been more thankful in my life that one of my children is only hurt that much   hopefully she will be going home tomorrow or sunday  scared the s#*t out of me "
<propfemale> is doing a bit better today  she left the trauma step down unit and was sent to a regular hospital room  no idea when she will go home  she is having some memory problems  she can't remember the accident (not uncommon) but also can't remember why she is in the hospital (she has been told several times)  doc's are doing futher testing  hopefully she will be home monday  thanks for all your prayers 
<propfemale> went home yesterday  she is staying with her mom now  she is upset because her computer broke in the crash  told her to relax and just get better  the only thing broken was a computer screen  i can live with that
