loves watching people who think their top dog get tired after an easy workout
"yesterday was the first full laser tag game i enjoyed ever (lots of targets, no d-bags, not enough friends there though unfornately)"
one of my biggest pet peves is when everyone but a few people is busting their a** and the ones that don't work hard are bein the cockiest   whether it's track or actual work in the working world you shouldn't be a cocky s o b  if you don't work at it!
has no stinkin idea why but just got really bummed out as soon as i got home
just got back from a kalkaska gun and knife show  it was awesome except i didn't have the money to buy anything i liked (which was pretty much half the stuff  laugh  boy i wish i had that kind of money)
it makes me sad to see celebrities driving nice classic cars and they don't even do any of the work to restore it (ex  <propmale> <propmale> and his 68' mustang )
hate's writing resamays (i know i spelled it wrong but i don't know how to put the things over the letters)
finally finished wiring our trailer with new lights  took me and my dad 9 hours to do because we thought we had bad grounds when it was actually the plug we use to connect the trailer's lights to the circuit that the truck uses to power the trailers lights  sux that we wasted so much time when it was something that we didn't even know was broken and can't fix in our driveway 
"my dad just got a new 2010 canam 800 efi xt outlander with pretty much everything on it, has 71 hp (which is 2x higher than any other atv in the same size bracket) and can go from 0-30 faster than you can count from 0-1 5 (i am dead serious this is the only atv that i've ridden that accelerated so fast the first time i rode it the first 2 words that ever came out of my mouth were holy s***t!!!! and i about did it)"
mad that dad's new atv almost paid 13 grand for it it and they forgot an air filter  the worst part was we didn't realize it until after a 3 hour ride on some of the dustiest trails in michigan behind 4 other quads  hope it didn't hurt the engine too bad but knows that the engine is probably damaged  but how do you forget an air filter 
hates it when for no apparent reason gets really pissed off and cant calm down worst part is i don't even know why i get pissed i just do
knows he has a good weekend when you go through about 11 gallons of gas and the only reason you came home 3 hours early is because you ran out of gas in his toy  laugh 
"hey everyone i started a <propfemale> that i will be monitoring that is about taking a random survey about anything! i will post new surveys every week  some will be wacky and others a little more serious but never over contorversial material! i encourage you all to join and invite others to join it\s just for fun! it's called: just4kiks surveys 1st survey is going to start tomorrow and the rules are going to be posted today"""

yess track season started!!! first practice wasnt long enough for my liking but that's why a second run was ran  not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing but during our practice a teammate gave me the middle finger after i told him good job  i'll take it that he's jealous of my speed but i do hate being disrespected like that  it was uncalled for and unreasonable 
60 degrees out!! perfect running weather today
well    my brother is in front of the door to our house and he isn't moving fast enough so i can get inside so instintively i called him fat  after we got in we weighed ourselves and needless to say it's going to be hard calling him fat when i'm almost 10 pounds heavier than he is lol
so today i got home and i was just dead tired  and i now know why mr  jacobs likes naps so much
