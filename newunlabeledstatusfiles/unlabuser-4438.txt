"no, jesus wasn't born on christmas  according to the gospels of <propmale>, <propfirst> and others, jesus was born most likely in late september, or anything but winter  the reason we began celibrating his birth at all, and on december 25 (as early as 236 ce) was to accomodate for pagan converts, who celibrated natalis solis invicti and the birthday of mithras on december 25th "

"i don't think i should be told how i should type and speak or what language i should use when posting on facebook  my status is an e playful ression of my thoughts and my feelings at the moment i type them and click 'share'  if my words, language or e playful ressions offend you or if you just feel like nitpicking over my use of foul language, then feel free to unfriend me or filter out my news feed "
