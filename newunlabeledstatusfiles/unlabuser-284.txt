it would be great if nobody showed up to school tomorrow  it would also give me more time to finish my homework

can't stop sneezing 
slept for 12 hours   and could still continue to sleep   
"putting a considerable amount of effort into not doing bio  \\so what the heck? i'll do it again  truth is   "
has quite possibly the worst work ethic  ever 
and i have to speculate that god himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the <propmale> ?
just realized how much i have completely spaced out during bio  two days before the test  * party finger *
"if i'm this person you say i am, then why has nothing changed?"
it's amazing how unmotivated i can get until the very last second 
"when you realize how small you are compared to the world, certain things don't matter "
"broke my glasses, have no idea how i'm going to get through school tomorrow   playful "
"me: hey, eighth graders, interested in joining the speech team? mikey maloney: no? well are you interested in acting? <propfirst> moran-rudd: no? well do you like to win things? good, now take the dang flyer "

so proud to be on a team with such talented people  smile  congrats guys! kick butt at state!
maybe you would have been something i'd be good at  maybe i would have been something you'd be good at   love 
"? i feel like an <propmale>ist who's lost his touch, \he likes himself in his <propmale>\but not his <propmale> too much  love "
"pretty sure anyone who went to state just woke up in the past three or four hours at least   smile  \congrats everyone!"
motivated to do absolutely nothing

retyping my entire english journal because my computer deleted it  what a freshman

running out of time to screw around  annoyed 
"yeah, geometry  i can spend a couple hours on your quarter project  it's not like i have a life or anything "
"because i'm bored (again) annoyed truth is   "
