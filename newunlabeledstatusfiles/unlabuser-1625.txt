"i hate guys i really really hate them, and i hope he gets everything he deserves "
love is a temporary madness 
i'll stop the world and melt with you 
"this goes to show that no one should leave me alone to cook  i'm a horrible cook, i almost burnt down the house!"
"so i'm apathetic and i keep people at a distance, what else is new?"
"i love you so much it hurts sometimes  so much i'd travel out into space just to look for you if i couldn't find you on earth  so much i'd waste my last breath to tell you just that, i love you "
getting lost in the stars 
the lake of fire feels like cool wind 
ah    what an adventure   smile 
his mood swings are starting to give me whiplash 
i need a day where i don't have to be around those who were involved  i need a day where i don't have to deal with someone asking me if i'm alright and that their sorry for what was said  i need an away day 
quiet and cold hearted 
where is my mind?
"just smile and nod and make look like your paying attention, trust me, it works i do it all the time  lol"
and we all fall down     wink 
sick and tired    i wish i were still under my sheets dreaming 
if you don't know who you are then you don't know who your not and if you don't know who your not then what's stopping you from being who you want to be?

some people were dropped as a baby you were clearly thrown against a wall 
according to my phone this morning i had an hour left of sleep until i remembered that i'm not in l a  right now and i'm actually an hour ahead  what a disappointing morning   annoyed 
"you cause unnecessary drama, get over it!"

its a bitter sweet symphony this life 
"i wish my dreams would come true, because if that were the case i would be standing at the beach looking at the refelction of the <propfemale> blur along with the waves "
wisdom can only go so far when your mind is so dense 
getting down in the town that makes no sound  where we keep it simple but make it more complex 
"guitars, family and their music, with wine, liquor, a christmas tree, smiles and laughter  it's starting to feel like christmas   smile "
"su lastimoso cÃ³mo <propfemale> asideros quietos <propfemale>a rencilla contra alguien que no hace algo  el dicho perdÃ³n para algo otra persona hizo obviamente no es bastante  si desea que ruegue su perdÃ³n entonces usted acostumbrado lo consigue  este va sÃ³lo mostrar cuÃ¡n bueno de <propfemale> amiga que es, obviamente no tan gran "
"i'll pick mysef up once again like i have time and time before, this is nothing but a scratch compared to the past "

"so i almost got killed today, again  if there's one thing that i hate about los <propfemale> it's the freeways and the cargo trucks on it  i think i need a driver and a 24 7 body guard, it's settled "
\want to put my tender heart in a blender,\2117d26e4e7b2b1aae908e42573dd4c7,no one wants to live in a world without cookies 
"music seems just as calming as nirvana, while decisions are being made, the world you once knew has flown upside down, voices and faces you once counted on to make you smile just dont cut it anymore, and theres nothing i can but put on my headphones and let the nerve drown out  a reality so far from accepting "
too much arizona sun for one day    it makes me feel sick   annoyed 
i give up on you   
racquetball game then swimming then acupuncture tomorrow    sounds like an amazing day  smile

"smell the sweetness, in even the most deadliest of places "
i'm going to miss you     ;
