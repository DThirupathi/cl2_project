i actually got to go home tonight   what an original concept   only two more baseball games left to go this season   woohoo!  wish i had had twins   at least they would be on the same teams 
i now have a hole in my yard as long as my arm in an attempt to retrieve the stuck water hose somebody (who is 8 years old) stuck down it with the water running   i can't dig any deeper unless i dig a hole wider than myself   i guess i'll just cut it off 
12 hour car ride with whole family to chetek tomorrow   i wish it was saturday already so i could just be cruising the lakes   thank goodness for dvd players and snacks

"wants to know why an 8 year would think its a good idea to throw meatloaf at his brother, repeatedly, while mom's taking a shower   he's going to have a really boring week now after the walls are cleaned up "
did we have this much homework in grade school?  i don't remember doing any homework until at least jr  high and even then i kept it to a minimum   my 3rd grader has 10 sheets a week and it is wearing me out   i have become a professional nagger!
of course it's a holiday weekend   when else would a large section of shingles fall off my roof into my backyard?  at least it's not supposed to rain 
"not sure exactly what's going on in my house today but it seems to involve lego men, knex men, army men, a battleship, an aircraft carrier, two stories, a balcony, a rope, and two little boys in their underwear "
and so begins soccer season with an 8 am game 
"and its raining, and raining, and raining   let's hope my incorrectly installed roof decides to stay put"
"yeah!!  after 5 years or so, several medication trys, one spinal cord untethering, the current pills, and a patch, today's appointment at <propmale> says we have finally conquered <propfirst>'s spastic bladder (or at least now have it under control)   i'm just going to ignore what those patches are costing me "
i am so excited   i get the whole weekend with my husband and not the boys   it's been years since i've been able to ditch them  wink 
"i just found myself singing presidential boogie for my boys because we were talking about songs that help you remember things   amazingingly enough, it's all still in my head   no wonder i can't remember anything new anymore lol"

listening to <propfirst> play what child is this on his violin and i can recognize it   all that money is finally starting to pay off 
"corbin, at the age of 6 has just made his first musical  he's going to be in the music man in march   he's in the boys band   i was proud of him as went up on that big empty stage and sand <propfirst> indiana all by himself   watching him try to dance choreography for the first time was entertaining "
"to drive or not to drive   guess we'll decide tomorrow morning after we check the weather again   so far looks ok til the wi border, but the dells to sparta looks scary "
"we made it to wi   the roads never really iced over, but the temp hovered between 30-34 from mid-illinois on   i think we dodged a bullet and am very happy to be home for christmas "
"trying to clean carpets   whoever thought white carpet was a good idea should be shot   seriously considering just getting new carpet   it will not be white   (and no, i didn't pick it, it came with the house)"

at the payroll national convention   at dinner tonight there was a legal disclaimer on the table for the party afterwards   what's with that?!  then i got to the party room where they were serving alcohol and the first thing i see is someone being strapped into a metal ball cage to be used as a human bowling ball   now i know lol   there were many other activities also

had a totally i'm old moment at the grocery   picked up gremlins since i thought the kids would like it   the cashier and the high school bagger were talking about it and he'd never even heard of it   *sigh*
