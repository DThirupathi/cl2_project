"put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on the death <propfemale> when it was obliterated by the rebel terrorists  the empire brings unity, but the rebel terrorists continue to <propmale> division and hatred  2,471,647 imperial citizens died in the terrorist attack against the death <propfemale>  93% of people won't copy paste this  will you be one of the few make this your status for at least one hour?"
"please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on alderaan when it was obliterated by the death <propfemale>  my wish is that people will understand the empire is a band of murdering scum  the rebel alliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy, but the empire continues to kill innocent civilians     93% of people won't copy paste this  make this your status for at least an hour "
"half day, subway, and new phone  laugh "
"<propmale> wood was awsesome\everyone should watch it\i need to go see plan 9 now"

"wow, jhonen's finally working on a new comic  but he's gonna have someone else do the <propmale>, and he himself is just writing it \i guess it should be great, but i really like his <propmale> style, so it's unfortunate"
"raked leaves, wrote a terrible essay, going to band practice now"
we don't need our heads 'cause our bodies are young
so the new mcr album seems kind of average  it's a shame considering the band is capable of doing so much better
so apparently being transformed into an enormous cockroach isn't nearly as enjoyable as i thought it should be

"d&d was great  got band practice tomorrow along with a monster of an essay to write and exam shit to study  how will i do it all you might ask?\i won't "

"people need to stop bitching about bands they like selling out  like half the time it doesn't even actually affect their style too drastically, and if it does it's usually just a new direction the band wanted to e playful lore  god forbid they should broaden their fan base and make more money for doing something they love  not every band on a <propmale> label sucks because they're too mainstream for you  jesus christ"
oh my god my essay wasn't even long enough i'm probably gonna fail or something
