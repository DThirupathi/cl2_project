how did it come to this where did it all go wrong? nothing seems to be what it used to and no ones happy i lie awake at night this feeling just aint right these words go round n round in my head like a broken record this is a tragety like bad tv one more day n i will e playful lode whats the point to drag it out lets put it in the ground  -the souls
we came down with a crushing might i might be mistaken we came down with a sickening plight forever forsaken we got all bent out of shape hopelessly dreadful confessed a gaping mouthful no love no hate we came down with a crushing might something so rotten we gave up the good fight forever forgotten into the night
patience        and a little time to myself  maybe ill draw or write something today!

"nobody is perfect, as long as you try to do the best you can with your given situation"
late last night i made my plans it was the only thing i felt i could dosaid goodbye to my best friendit's gonna kill me the rest of my life let me apologize while i'm still alive i know it's time to face all of my past mistakes it's gonna kill me for the rest of my life this is my all time low somehow it feels so familiar i feel like letting go and every second that goes by
i'm screaming out for second tries said goodbye to my best friend sometimes thereâ€™s no one left to tell me the truth let me apologize while i'm still alive i know it's time to face all of my past mistakes i've got to live with them the rest of my life this is the mess i've made
these are the words i can't erasethis is my life support shutting down for the final time and it twists like a bladeand kills me for the rest of my life if you won't forgive me the rest of my lifelet me apologize while iâ€™m still alive i know it's time to face all of my past mistakesits gonna kill me the rest of my life
a breath of fresh air and some time to think
!!
j ust when you think there is hope      theres not!!! sad 
"i wanna know if this is real, all these things that i feel!!!"
she will destroy us all before shes through and find a way to blame somebody else   
four loko!!!
"i dreamed id wake up in your arms and breathe you in, where are you? are you still here?"
you persist to hammer the nail through my heart and watch it bleed! are you happy now!!
i will never allow myself to fall victim to your sinister ways ever again
change starts in the heart!!! have faith you will get through!!!
life is what you make it
"its good to get out with the one you love, except the waitress was a dumb ass"
i still can't believe i am gonna be a dad! it's a joyous e playful erience and the baby is'nt even here yet 
can't wait to hold my baby in my arms      what a miracle!
"\through the lord all things are possible!\"""""
confusion sets in    where do i begin     
"this can't last forever\time won't make things better!\\i was better off a year ago\before i fell into your show\\i don't belive this is real\nothing left to feel"
this is the last time i'll take the blame for the sake of being with you!! because i am done!!!
it's gotta get hard before it get's easy      
take one step ata time      as long as it's the right direction      you will get to your desired destination 
gonna be a dad!!!!
"all i do is give and, all u do is take      well you gotta look before you leap  take a good look at your so called \friend\""    there was never a time i was never there for you  your never gonna understand!!!"""
i hate liars!!! especially ones that lie non stop and don't even care if they are hurting people in the process!!!!
sometimes all you can do is just let time tell the future!!!
life is too short to waste on bitches
change is inevitable except from a vending machine
fuckin whores

a rainy day missing the one that i love      wish you were here!!!

this is starting to really bug me!
well i guess its not as bad as i thought
"ahh so u say your lonely pulled away by the tide ,lost at sea all your senses soaking so heavy that you cant breathe let me take you to a place where the sun warms your face and the sound of the waves takes you away and the ghosts on the boardwalk will keep u company"
ahhh so you say your empty stripped away by the pain of broken dreams all these emotions clouding up your eyes til you cant see <propfemale> nothing you dont need the wind is there to guide your feet and your in good company
i love u sierra love 
"i love the bouncing souls!!! \whenever im down iknow where my friends can be found, whenever there is a doubt i just have to shout     oi oi          another night i got somewhere to go going out to the punk rock show where the air is hott and the music is loud this is my kind of place this is my kind of crowd  i will be here until the night is through"
"do i listen to my conscience on do i listen to my heart, that leaves my brain in the middle of a tug of war match and a huge headache    "
so many decisions in life!!! how do you know if your making the right ones?
"in this revolution no plans have been weitten for retreat  -<propfirst> <propmale> <propmale>, jr "
"thinking about life, a little time and hopefully it will work itself out! i hope"
sometimes goodbye is the only way!!!        time to tace care of myself    so i can take care of others     and how can u love if u dont love yourself
without family you have nothing!! there is nothing greater than having a family and i am blessed greatly to be given this gift    without a doubt
"close my eyes, take a deep breathe, let it out        now what??? i can do this will you stand by me?"
"break the mold, time to be free and dont let anyone tell you who to be!"
"life is a never ending lesson  by the time u learn anything and start to have an understanding of its many complexities , u die!"
"i found something im good at, not being good enough!"
love???
time for sleep maybe ill wake up in a new life!!
"i cant sleep cant seem to focus and ill lie awake alone without you on this night that never ends, what have we been waiting for? for this to breakdown? its in our hearts not our heads! awake but barely breathing eyes closed my heart is barely beating and i can feel this pressure building only thing  im feelin   we can overcome this weakness ~dont look down~"
"wake me up from this nightmare because in this dream ive seen this show a thousand times but eachvtime it gets more fucked  throw logic out the door bring disillusion and fear  distort everything, nothings clear  ive conditioned my mind to accept the worst yet it feels so familiar, like somehow ill return to this lonely state, to this reoccuring grey, to this infinite hell that i fear follows me"
"my name is where your heart is, where my mind can rest at ease  when i let down my defenses, i hold you close to me  daily life reminds me of my pain and misery  when i look in the mirror, this is so clear to see  so i sleep, i sleep to dream, i dream to wake up in your arms, breathe you in and kiss the lips of an angel"
feeling great!
it is great to be loved!! especially by someone sooo special
"she puts a smile on my face and love in my heart  in oh so many ways i love her, for we shall never part  when she is near, there is nothing i have to fear  holding one another close, there is no greater feeling  love is a very special gift!\                                              i love you <propfemale>  love 33"
why cant she see that she is everything to me and no one else could ever be     no one could even come close! now i close my eyes and sit here alone in an empty room all i here is my heart pounding and pray that she could just see i love her     i may not be perfect and i am sorry but there is no one else for me we were meant to be plz why cant you see     let me remove the blindfold from your eyes    
i cant sleep cant do anything i dont know what to do or why this happening
my heart hurts and i jusy dont dont know what to feel
i love her sooo much
battered    bruised    broken    nothing left to do    lost it all   everything i loved and cared about gone!!! i will never recover     she will always be the one     
i have no one i lost it all     if everything happens for a reason what is it
im dying this broken heart was stronger than i can stand
she brought meaning to my life and gave me a family and a baby    and true love i know im not perfect no one is      why does she take it all away?  sad   heart-broken 
"you know i feel so violent,\just want to break some glass,\every day i pray it'll be my last\turning to a blank wall wondering what to do?\turning to a caliber  22\every day he starts the same old fight \and every day it just gets worse by night \if i hit the streets i think i'll be alright \but until i do, i won't be safe tonight "
dont believe the lies!!!
i know all about the lies and that is why i have to cut ties       
if u think there is a chance     think again   im not playing your game    it will just never change your always gonna be the same    hide behind for facade       underneath that sweeet sweet skin there is pure eveil   and i will not be tempted by you      there is nothing you can do    i know the truth      this is the end   now let me go mend my broken heart    sad i knew it from the start   it would come to this 
http annoyed  www youtube com watch?v=ac_xzitahlu
"one o one point one fahrenheit\to some it's a fever, to her it's just right\and i can't hold her, and it's bringin' me down\her blood runs hot but her heart beats cold\she's a devil with an angel's face i've been told\i think i'll push my luck next time you're around"
well aparently my own friend just turned on me too and in the streets   fuck everything she sucked him back in too slowly drain him i hate backstabbers and minipulative liars
idk i dont mlike the games      it needs to fuckin stop
"i need you     need to touch you, breathe you,"
i cant go on without you for one more second!!! im going nutz!!!
"a whirldwind of lies! i dunno anymore  what i do know is i wish i felt the way i did the first day i ever layed eyes on her! the greatest day ever, yet the worst memory the thought is like a bullet to the chest, my blood is pooring out  will you let me bleed out or will you step in and save the day?"
"chew me up and spit me out, i fell for this <propfemale> many times and still i stick with this, im sick of this, but in my sickness an addiction, your as addictive as they get, evil as they come, vindictive as they make em, my friends ask why i cant just walk away, addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, i guess im a mess, cursed and blessed "
when will this crazyness stop and my world stop spinning and falling apart
eminem - 25 to life!!! fuck this bullshit!!
a sigh of relief! there is nothing greater than having the one you love in your arms and holding them close while your little one grows inside their belly 
"love is patient, love is kind  it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud   it does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs  love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth   it always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres  love never fails "
