you can wear your feelings pretty close to the surface today and might even be overly e playful ressive if you have been withholding your anger  but others won't likely let you run on with your emotions unrestrained and their response can upset you even more  keep in mind that your perceptions may be warped by hurtful memories and the present moment may not be quite as intense as it seems 
oh god   = = the miracle of today is me making through it at all   
burn the bridges that you used to keep and you soon wake up to ashes of the mistakes that will always haunt you
sad face: for all the missed chances   
*smack my forehead* so stupid am i

silence is the scream that something is wrong    
ever had the feeling that you don't want to call someone but at the same time you do want to call them ?
exhausted but this mind of mine is doing a number on me     i'll keep trying to sleep
doesn't know why or how he is still awake
"x x sleeping now , completely gone"
let freedom ring for the child who dreams
feeling sorry and a little lousy
zune hd 64gb is all mine
"moivng into <propmale> tomorrow, yes    "
finding it hard to convince the one that i love so much   
is in a weird state of mind    
rag doll - maroon 5 preaches how i feels
from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows
"ever had that , shit hit the fan feeling ?"
breath in and breath out  let the time passed and wait for the feeling to drown inside  as a smile returnes and i move on
had a bad night   plain and simple
is dealing with his own fights at the moment
who knew that the greatest fight is the countless war inside
is in a constant state of alertness
going to halloween horror nights  xx tomorrow
working for a impossible dream
let the battle begin     *evil laugh*
"hoping he has a wonderful halloween that is full of treats , pics , and of course lot of fun "
can't wait for what he's hoping will soon happen
"communication is the key, huh ?"
so hope happiness will be in my near furture
tease her to please her
"type your name: <propmale> edwards\with your elbow: l incolknb edwards\with your nose: op89hd90ohb3ee32wqr4ew\with your eyes closed: lincilj n rfesrfdd\put this as your status, don't erase your mistakes "
hoping for a christmas miracle!
get ready to see some new pics so    and maybe a new me
wish me luck and hope this weekend  goes without any fault
properly did his biggest mistake ever
and now i think i'm coming down with something
wtf! to the fifth power!  someone is really gone try me
can't wait to come back to <propmale> !
     words can't even describe my anguish
"school startes today , for me 10am baby"
"still awake am i , crazy i am not =p"
