had a nice relax day today after a fun new year <propfemale>  hoping the next few days will be the same 
"freaking out, stressing out, soon to blow up at people who are being stupid  what's a girl to do?????"
hmmm test of all tests    more for me then i think for my daughter    long trip ahead to the cabin   who will win the 2 year old screaming in my ear the whole time or my high hopes that everything will go well  i guess will see 
i am so thankful for the higher people who can get things done my daughter is saved and blessed who hoo     now can get the meds to keep her on the right path   thanks to the support and help of family and friends and of course the higher people 
way excited    i think i found what i want to go to school for checking out the <propmale> instutitue on wed  can't wait 
looking forward and ahead   will not be looking back    going to take the steps i need in life to make it to the next jump    i can't get anywhere is life just waiting for it got to jump high for it even if i land hard a couple of times along the way 
i am so excited about october i can't wait to see my son it needs to come faster       smile 
i think i need to stop being manic cause if i don't i might just really have to go crazy no sleep and a daughter will do that   
hmmm i think i might be a little bored tonight   what kind of trouble can i stir up  
i love rain but not in favor of such a cold front right now   come in another month and i will deal with you then 
i am so nervous today but really excited  i get to see my son today  i hope everything goes really well wish me luck 
i had a great day and feeling great and there is more to come 
can't wait till the tantric concert tonight going to have so much fun  
excited for a night off and a fun girls night  
this day right now is either going to break me or change me can i do what i need to do to make me feel better and to keep my daughter going without seconhand smoke 1st day for quitting smoking wish me luck here i go  1     2     3     jumping away from what makes me sane everyday my very bad habit 
i am finally tired woo hoo i might get a full night sleep tonight we can only hope then my insomnia will not change its mind 
my daughter is driving me crazy today   can i not be mom today  
still unsure of where i want to go to school and if i can do this  i know what i want to be i just can't seem to find the right place where i am like lets do this i have the knot in my stomach saying nope not right yet when can it be like yes lets do this 
feeling like i am stuck in the middle and 2 people are pulling me from side to side and i can't seem to move any which way without getting pulled back 
i need to win money feel totally broke  wondering how i am going to get through the next few more months
yay!! i was on top of cleaning today got a lot done 
happy haloween!!! be careful tonight  smile  good hauntings   
i think i need a break   need to get out of the house tonight and drink coffee 
thank goodness this day is over    can't wait for another day to come so it can maybe go better 
yay!!! for coffee!!! can't live without it it seems to save my life and moods everyday 
i am getting really tired of pleasing the cf clinic and getting really sick of looking for daycare's that only have 2 to 3 kids in it ahhhh this is not working 
feel very tired and drained today need to wake up and get energy 
why can't terrible two's be called terrific two's it would so help my days and nights like this where i have to keep reminding myself not to go insane               
wishing i could go on a trip to think and relax and be stress free for a little bit  this day has took a curve ball and brought some bad news that puts my life on hold again  hoping that maybe something will go right soon but so far does not look like it 
ok so i think i have discovered the root of the my problem that put my life on hold and now going forward again in a good speed now back to being happy go lucky me  very excited  smile 
i think tonight is going to be my good night to relax in a warm blanket and read my book and drink hot chocolate  mmmm can't wait!!!!
"yay for friday night   get to go out, will be going to coffee tonight anyone want to join me could use some company and good conversations?"
"so much hard work seems to be slipping down the drain as my daughter won't eat and seems to be getting sick, looks like i have to see how the weekend goes or it might be back up to the cf clinic on monday to see what happens then "
i need to get some sleep but my eyes won't seem to stay shut ahhhh another night of no sleep woo hoo  hello miss grouchy in the morning  
the best remedy for having sleepless nights and feeling drained is to just laugh 
"really wish i could think of a few things to do with my overly active daughter  wish i could take her out but can't, wish i could have her play with someone but that will not happen so what do i do for an overly active 2 year old who won't even sit for more then 5 <propfemale>????"
how many wrongs can you make in life before you get it right? is it worth the <propmale> and risk or is it just best to walk away and never look that way again  should the test be easy or hard what direction do you look too when your mind and heart are confused as well should the test even be there or is that my answer is there should be no test and i am looking at everything all wrong????
i am thanking all my family and friends for giving great advice and taking time to talk to me i am glad you are all in my life 
i just lost the game again    
happy thanksgiving everyone  i hope everyones day goes well and is happy 
is having a good week overall and hopefully will be having a great night   
so i feel even more confused then ever  i really need to relax and get sleep but that won't happen and i really want to figure out where my life is going and how to get there cause that is also not helping one bit i just don't want to deal with this anymore feeling like everything is going against me and i am so about to give up 
yay for the ups and downs of sick children hoping it will get better soon   today is going a little bit better just hoping shaney does not drop like she usually does i really don't want a clean out this year 
totally just got beat up by a 2 year old sometimes i just wish i could take away everything away and live peacfully but that would just cause more fits what is a girl to do 
feeling a little down and confused today i think i need to get out of the house and do something tonight that might help 
but i like a cookie        
wish me luck on doctors appointments for shaney today she is sick and now i have a list of things to remember to make sure nothing has changed or were in for a 2 week clean out i hate this part of the year 
i love when i get so many little kids songs stuck in my head from shaney's shows i think its great and people think i am crazy for it as i am singing it all day 
i dislike being sick and having to take care of your sick child with it i just want to sleep all day and that won't happen and this stupid cold weather needs to go away bring back my sun please 
"i have decided i am not a big fan of snow i like how it looks around the right time, but i hate driving in it i hate that fact its so cold i hate the fact that my daughter can't go outside at all because of it i think i am eventually going to move to warmer state    "
has finally got some energy and now ready to get back on track 
i have decided that i am not liking the medicine shaney is on 7 more days of my little girl not wanting to sleep and being hyper and awake all the time ahhhh going to go insane need sleep       
very excited tonight get to go out and see a movie with friends have not been to a movie in forever  yay
you know when your lovely friends and family says your going to have trouble with you daughter when she gets older lol   so today i asked my 2 year old daughter will you be nice to mommy when you turn 13 she says yes so then i asked her one more will you be nice to mommy when you are 16 she says ya ya i guess i laughed so hard cause of course i can't get a second yes but it was cute  lol
i feel like i am losing my mind and i can't seem to find it anywhere 
feeling very blank lately don't know what i am doing anymore  i really hate the winter months not just because its cold and dreary all the time but beacuse i have to deal with shaney sick all the time and new medicines i have to remember constantly i feel like i have to be super mom and don't know how to be 
yay!!! worked out a schedule that works with everyone including with all my daughters treatments now i get to go to the <propmale> bliss concert with my best friend very excited       smile 
very excited about tonight    <propmale> bliss concert here i come yay for a fun night out with friends 
is looking forward to christmas as i get to watch shaney have so much fun    <propfemale> christmas everyone 
spring cleaning coming early yay!! get rid of the old toys that make a mess everywhere and make room for so much more woo hoo   
"happy new year everyone, drive safe tonight for whoever is going out   "
"my 2 year old says the cutest things ever    her first cute thing is get the hellaphone, hello phone  the other cutest thing ever was she put stuff on the table today and it decided to fall off well the first thing out of her mouth was oh my cookie!! it was so cute and very funny "
leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me  it can only be 1 word  no more than 1 word  then copy & paste this post on your wall so i can leave a word about you  this should be interesting
"you gain strength, courage and confidence by every e playful erience in which you really stop to look fear in the face  you are able to say to yourself, \i lived through this horror  i can take the next thing that comes along \""       you must do the thing you think you cannot do   <propfemale> <propmale>"""
feeling very broken today with hurt emotions put into it  i don't see how hurting others to gain power helps anyone  i feel like i am a constant battle and to win means to just step down and to cry when really the only way is to step forward and look ahead and move that way but i think it would just be easier to cry and crawl back into not talking to anyone 
"if you're being chased by a police dog, try not to go through a tunnel, then on to a little seesaw, then jump through a hoop of fire  they're trained for that!"
had great news from the cf clinic today was really suprised and very happy all at the same time  shaney is doing great and well on the way for another good year yay!!!!
feeling like every direction i turn to its another stupid dead end  once i get to a good spot i have to turn around and look the other way to fix a new problem this is getting so pointless  i want to move the way i want to but can't ever seem to get there without having to deal with so much more on my plate just give me a break please can i not seem to do anything right for myself or is this how it will always be???
got all dressed up make up and everything and no where to go but at least i feel better   smile
