"people hide behind masks\go deep enough inside yourselves and you will find\the darkness\smashing against it,\begging to be let out "
"alone or with friends she feels nothing \her eyes are always empty \joy will find them on only one day \the day she is taken by death "
"tears streaming out of her lifeless eyes,\she looked up to the heavens and choked out one word  \why?\""\",148797810d3640cb47a8566a236bcc1a,"the first day i saw her was also the last \that annoying, funny girl, who had quiet a past \she never stopped laughing, her eyes full of life \but still on that night, she rolled back her sleeves, and lowered the knife "
"let's see how creative my facebook friends are  leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name  it can only be 1 word  then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you  don't just post a word and not copy, that's no fun"
"either we have a day off today, or im just not coming in to skool      one way or another im getting my snow day!"
look at me i'm a target! - 11th doctor  laugh  so i've decided watching doctor who is more important then studding for mid-terms
"gerneral staal: we have an intruder!\the doctor: how'd he get in? in-tru-da window?"
"doctor: almost every species in the universe has an irrational fear of the dark, but they're wrong, because it's not irrational  it's vashta nerada \donna: what's \vashta nerada\""?\",148797810d3640cb47a8566a236bcc1a,"father octavian: a stone angel on the loose among stone statues    a lot harder than i'd prayed for \river song: a needle in a haystack \the doctor: a needle that looks like hay  a hay-like needle of death  a hay-like needle of death in a haystack of    uh, statues  [brief pause] no, yours was fine "
"amy: you bit me!\the doctor: yeah, and you're alive \amy: oh, i've got a <propfirst>, look at my hand!\the doctor: and you're alive! did i mention?\amy: blimey, your teeth, have you got space teeth?!\the doctor: yeah, alive, all i'm saying!"
"the doctor: [aiming gun at the ceiling] didn't anyone ever tell you? there's one thing you never put in a trap if you're smart  if you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap \angel bob: and what would that be, sir?\the doctor: me  [fires]"
     so i use my extra day off school to watch doctor who and eat lots of food        what does this say about me?  laugh 
"<propfemale> pond: what if the gravity fails?\the doctor: i've thought about that \<propfemale> pond: and?\the doctor: we will all plunge to our deaths  see? i've thought about it!"
the doctor: stop talking  brain thinking  hush!
"so, i just went to feed my frogs and found out one of them had died  so i went to check on my turtle and, low and behold    she died too       playful "
no school! yay!!!!!!!!!  smile
