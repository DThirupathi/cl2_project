"wonders what the f fb did to hide my husband's news feeds from me   we are both friends on each others list, with nothing on the hidden <propfemale>; what gives?"
"ha, as soon as i mention it, he pops up into my feed  coincidence or conspiracy?"
"so, i passed out around 11pm, but <propfirst> woke me up at midnight for my new years kiss  got up at 3:45am to go pee and was only half surprised to still hear the mexican circus music going and the neighbors (including children) still partying it up  glad i use white noise in my bedroom, otherwise i would have been up all night "
"had a great birthday anniversary weekend  saw sherlock holmes at the drive-in on saturday night, avatar in 3d on sunday, followed by dinner at the cheesecake factory and for our 13 year (total together) anniversary, we went to dinner at chili's and just <propmale> out together  life is grand  laugh "

"fallout 3 is sucking my life away  not like the fb timesink  you realize how long you have been playing because your back and eyes hurt, and you keep looking at the clock so you know *exactly* how much of your life is gone   and you continue on  'just one more mission' or, 'i just want to walk over to this area, just to get them on my map   then i'll stop' but then you run into yet another quest and you trudge on "
hating the new fb layout  why break something so that you can then fix what wasn't broken to begin with?
celebrating our 8 year wedding anniversary today  started out awesome with <propfirst> oversleeping and having to rush to work    let's hope the rest of the day is better for both of us

i have almost become a pro at going to the dentist  got a temporary crown which means i have to chew using the other side of my mouth for 2 weeks  sucky because the other side has a crooked tooth causing food to *constantly* get stuck there  guess i will be doing a lot of flossing for the next couple of weeks

is wondering what the hell i am doing up so early  the only time i wake up before noon is if i have to go to a job and i haven't had to worry about that for at least 6 months   but hanging out with <propfirst> before he goes to work does have its advantages  wink 
"is curious about where the water all over the floor is coming from; either the toilet is leaking again (annoying since we just replaced it a few months ago) or is it the washer  tentatively running the washer with towels all over the floor in case of another mishap   ::fingers crossed nothing is actually leaking, really don't want to spend more time or money on the bathroom::"
"<propmale>, what do you fear most in the world? the possibility that love is not enough "

my face hurts from laughing so hard tonight  had a blast watching <propfirst> tosh at the improv!
"is soooooo pissed  can anyone tell me why the universe hates me so? leaether strip waits until *after* we completely, no refunds available, booked our trip to vegas and then announces he will be at the treffen  why did that volcano have to blow any chances of us finding a cheap flight to germany? i'll tell you, because it hates me "

"so, went and saw the nightmare 're-imagining' last night at the drive-in  i hate to say this, but i liked it  for those who have never seen any of the originals, it gives <propmale> a much more sinister feel, even meaner then new nightmare  i also liked the fact that they kept some of my favorite lines from the originals, as well as the creepy music and little kids  \still, i think it is time for a nightmare-a-thon "
"feels like taking a nap  babysitting and realizing that the longer he sleeps the better, but it is hard to keep quiet enough not to wake him  it doesn't help that my cats keep trying to inspect the 'alien being' in their house  lol"

"gah! i am bored and anxious  i have checked everything thrice and now i am not sure what to do   waiting impatiently to go to bed  feels like the night before the first day of school, or right before any holiday in which you get presents  can't wait to be in vegas already "
"is in vegas, bitches!"
