"day 6,239: that was a frightening dream  i hated it so much that after what happened happened, i ran as far as i could and when i finished running i was a lone wolf and that put me off edge so i went to a house and stayed their until i accepted what happened then i just walked away "
"day 6,240: this is another sleepless night that i am having but for once it is productive  i am planning on surprising her today with something random and inspiring  something she has done for me and i will prove that she doesn't have to fear me  not anymore "
"day 6,241: i feel a little better now "
"day 6,241 continued: i guess that i felt better but now, the one time i am having fun i get yelled at for no reason       or atleast she couldn't give a reason that didn't have to do with her mood      most likely dad did some thing stupid i am going to let it air out and then ask her why she was so angry "
"day 6,242: did i help, or fail again?"
day whatever continued: wow tournament was awesome i played a deck that was exactly like mine 
"day 6,243: today would have been the last day      why can't anyone understand    "
