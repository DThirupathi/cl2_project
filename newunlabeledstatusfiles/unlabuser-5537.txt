"whatever you give a woman, she will make it greater  give her sperm, she will give you a baby  give her a house, she will give you a home  give her groceries, she will give you a meal  give her a smile, she will give you her heart  she multiplies & enlarges what she is given  so, if you give her crap, be ready to receive a ton of shit! post on your wall if you agree   i hope to see every female post"

"most people have 1,000 wishes for christmas; a cancer patient only has one, to get better  i know 97% of you won't repost this to your status, but my friends will be the 3% that do  in honour of someone who has died, or is still fighting, or survived cancer, copy this to your status"

"????????????=??? ????? ???????????????\* if you have an amazing daughter, put this as your status *\???????????=???? ????? ???????????????"
"i am a handful - unfortunately most women won't re-post this  i'm strong willed, independent, a bit outspoken, and i tell it like it is  i make mistakes, i am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle but i love and give with all my heart  if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best  if you are a handful, re-post!"
happy valentine's day!!!xoxoxoxo
"????????????=??? ????? ???????????????\* if you have an amazing daughter, put this as your status *\???????????=???? ????? ???????????????"
i have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please post this as their status for one hour  i know my friends will  think of someone you know or love who has had cancer  my prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found  will you post it? just one hour  do it for all of us  there are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it  i hope to see this in the status of all my friends
have a great day!!!
"the girl you just called fat, she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs  the boy you just called stupid, he has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night  the girl you just called ugly, she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her the boy you just tripped, he is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  put this status up if you're against bullying"
happy saint patrick's day!!!!
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, being a witch, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they left off, even if it has been months (or even years) apart  they love you   for who you are  re-post if you have at least one true friend    they will know who they are!"
peach
