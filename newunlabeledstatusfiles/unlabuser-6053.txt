"think fast! leave one memory that you and i had   together  it doesn't matter if you knew me a little or a lot, anything   you remember! don't send a message, leave a comment on here  next,   re-post this in your notes and see how many people leave a memory about   you  this could be scary but i think it will be fun"
"while you scream at\ your woman, there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear    \while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with \her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, \there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your \women cry there's a    man stealing smiles from her    post this on \your wall if you're against domestic violence"
