"the penguins better win tonight, or it'll be like football season all over again        "
finally the pens won!!!! my week became a lot better all of a sudden      
does anyone know what chapters are on the biology final?
is still happy over the pens game!!!!!!
"i officially hate finals     i do not remember a word of chemistry despite reading it five times, and now i have to take a test on it????"
"i just noticed that the word try is in chemistry    but then again, that's exactly what i don't feel like doing   "
"yes!!! i'm about to take a test on less than 6 hours of sleep, on information i don't even know!!!"
"i officially love finals    what isn't there to love? waking up early, taking tests on stuff you don't know, failing       sounds great to me    "
finals are halfway done!!!!! (i find it funny that math is the last set of finals      and that's the one i really don't want to take      )
studying is overrated     i'm going to fail anyways    
"if at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence you ever tried     or     if at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style        essentially, i should rip up my math final after i spent an hour and a half staring at the pages       "
"\it is not a disgrace to fail  failing is one of the greatest arts in the world \"" yes!!! my life just became so much better now that i know i have a skill!!!!"""
"if life is a piece of cake, what are finals? really disgusting icing or those weird pickled cherries?"
"last night, the penguins won, i ate a delicious cheesecake, and this morning my favorite song was on the radio  what could ruin today? oh, yeah, those things called finals    "
"finals are done     i'm actually not sure what to do with myself, now that i don't have anything to study        "
"just when life couldn't get any worse, someone takes out a camera          it e playful lains most of my pictures       "
i just realized that the word final is in finally       how ironic      
"when they say dance like no one's watching, people are still watching, right? just more witnesses to confirm my insanity    "
"why is life not like in the movies? i mean, why don't people just burst out singing in the middle of the day? i think that is the best way to acheive world peace, since everyone would just be laughing at how ridiculous they look          "
"4 day weekend! 4 days of sleeping, eating, watching hockey, and generally doing nothing           "
i would be a vegetarian except for the fact that i love bacon too much 
"it may be that your sole purpose in life is to serve as a warning to others  in other words, don't walk into walls!!!!"
"why is life giving people lemons, and where are they coming from? i'm pretty sure that this is proof of aliens      "
"if there was an award show for laziness, i'd take first place  but then again, i would be too lazy to walk up to the podium to accept the award "

so bored right now         so sick of homework            
is ready to give up on ever understanding chemistry  just because you understand the concepts doesn't mean you can apply them     
i am already ready for the weekend              
"when life gives you lemons, sell them to a gullible person and then use the money to buy yourself something useful       i mean lemons? really?"
"ain't that the way it goes? always stumbling into something, life's an open road, you've gotta take it  if you just let go, lose your way to find that one thing that you've been missing, you almost missed it all "
"if everything happens for a reason, life destiny fate has a weird sense of humor           "
"ain't no rhyme or reason, no complicated meaning, ain't no need to over think it, let go laughing, life don't go quite like you planned it - we try so hard to understand it - irrefutable, indisputable, the fact is it happens"
"life isn't about how many breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away "
"if every day is a gift, life has bad taste in gifts and would make a pretty awful <propfemale> claus          "
"you don't know this? i know something about history that you don't know     hold on one second, let me just take in this moment  this is cool  is this how you feel all the time? w-well, except now "
