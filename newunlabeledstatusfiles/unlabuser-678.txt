"so i thought, love could blind and see through the feelings and not just appearances, but i guess i was mistaken, for it sees what it wants, and seeks what it desires  one day perhaps the your open eye blindness will end and you will see the real love in front of your eyes    "

"it was once said that in order to live you must be alive, and in order to love you must have a heart! what happens then when you don't soul, can your heart still beat?"
