is glad to be home!
just got a macbook pro!
is not sure she likes her <propmale>- too many system problems! thought they were supposed to be better than pcs!!!!!!!
is home!!!!!!
is thankful for good friends 
"is glad her sister enjoys the finer things in life with her, such as: the misadventures of flapjack, bathtub crayons, and the wiggles live in concert "
wishes that if her neighbors insisted on listening to their music at unhealthy volumes they would at least have good taste in music!
gets to go to a seattle mariners game tomorrow and sit in the president's suite! only thing that could make it better was if she had remembered to pack her camera!
"i guess you know your fruit popsicle is really made from fruit when there are not only chunks of fruit, in this case strawberries, but also some leaves!!!"
is it stupid that i'm super excited for my neurology appointment simply because the doctor's name is dr  house?
"well, 45 minutes, three different beverages, several different google searches, and too many strategies to count later, i think i may be able to swallow my diuretic pill tomorrow! who would have thought that carbonation would help  now, we need to pray that it happens when i need it too, not just when i practice with pieces of marshmallow! why am i 24 and still not able to swallow pills like every other human???!!"
had a staring contest with a hawk today  it might have been the highlight of my week  smile 
"okay, this one sounds fun  i want all my facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me  but, i want you to lie  that's right  just make stuff up  and get creative! after you comment, copy this to your status so i can do the same "
