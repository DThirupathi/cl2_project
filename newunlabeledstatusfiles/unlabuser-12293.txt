"cale made his official weigh in yesterday! he lost the 4 pounds all by himself, i tell you this kid is determined  he got me though, when they came home he had his sad face on and said he didn't make it by one pound, they had me going for 15 minutes, then i took a good look at his face, it always gives it away! i am so proud of him!"
"cale has a game saturday against <propmale> park  finally he's playing against another city team, we won't have to drive so far  the coach has had them pushing the sled around all week, lets hope it pays off and they can knock the other team around a little, we have so many little guys on our team!"

"just finished reading one of the most moving, emotional books i have read in a long time, a thousand splendid suns by khaled hosseini  i definitely recommend it to anyone who has a little extra time to read (it was worth staying up past my usual bedtime and being tired in the morning)"

"i am looking to move! if anyone in the syracuse area knows of a three bedroom in the $600 to $700 range let me know  i am trying to stay towards the north side of syracuse but i'm willing to check anything out, as long as it's someplace where my kids can play outside without me worrying about them being safe  thanks!"

"we just found out our new dog lady is actually named <propfemale>, ran into her previous, previous owner (she has been moved around alot  sad  ) no wonder she never came when we called her, but say <propfemale> and she gets so excited! so now to convince aubri to call her <propfemale>, she just doesn't get it, lol"

"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear  while you humiliate, offend and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman, there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make your woman cry there's a man stealing smiles from her    post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence"

i really miss waking up to the sun! every morning this week has beencloudy and i just can't wake up no matter how much coffee i drink!
"had a great day with my hubby and our dad's yesterday! went to my aunt's house for a cookout for my dad, then to my sister-in-laws for a cookout for my father-in-law  too bad i'm as big as a house, the baby left no room for me to enjoy all the great food (but she left plenty of room for horrible heartburn!lol) happy be;ated fathers day to all the dad's!"

stupid refridgerator!!!
"so here it is, 1 smile 0 in the morning and everyone is sleeping soundly but me  i think this baby is going to have her days and nights mixed up just like aubri did, all day long she is fine but as soon as i try to sleep she decides to kicks me in my kidneys and ribs   awwwww the joys of motherhood!"
"it is so freakin hot that i think i'm melting! and yes my southern friends, i know you deal with weather like this all the time but you guys have central air everywhere you go! me, i have an ac in the bedroom, where i have been living 24 7 for the last few days        now i hate my bedroom! lol"
went for my 35 week sono and the baby weighs about 6 lbs  already! so far i'm not even close to dilating (could've sworn i'd be a couple of centimeters with all those damn braxton hicks) so now i'm down to wekly visits and hoping this baby gets as impatient as i am and decides to make her entrance a couple of weeks early!
"i have a few things i'm trying to get rid of if anyone wants them   1)aching back 2)tired feet 3) sore ankles 4) swollen hands 4) bulging belly  they are free and no returns please, i've had enough!"
"i must be nesting because i spent the entire day yesterday dusting, sweeping, mopping, waxing and organizing (the kids rooms are even spotless   amazing!) and even though my feet and back are sore i just added 3 things to my list! lol"
"trying my hardest to be patient! (unfortunately the more i try to be patient the more impatient i become, these last 3 weeks are going to take forever!)"
"me and the hubby walked 2 1 2 <propmale> yesterday trying to get this baby in the right position and i think it worked! i actually woke up today and felt great! she is definitely lower because i can breath now and i didn't wake up with heartburn, now hopefully she will figure out that she can come out at any time and start making some moves!"
"damn doctors! getting me all excited, i went thursday and was having some contractions, they checked and said i was in early labor, i thought i was too, contractions, backache, pressure, cramping, etc , etc  now it's saturday and nothing! this baby is going to be a stubborn little jokester    well i guess she'll fit right in then!"
"lohan who? i cant believe the news coverage being given to a spoiled 20-something yr old  here are a few 20 year-olds worth knowing about: <propfirst> <propfirst> 23, <propfirst> linley 29, <propmale> weikert 29, justus bartelt 27, <propmale> <propfirst> 21, <propmale> <propmale> 21, <propfirst> <propmale> 26, <propmale>hew <propmale> 23, <propfirst> goeke 23, & <propmale> tate 27  these 20-somethings gave their lives for you this week  repost if you support the military!!!"
"i was going to wait to start the d-day countdown until the 1st but then i realized that it would be an odd number (plus i'm too impatient!), i have enough odd things in my life, so i am starting now      10 more days! well unless she's as stubborn as aubri was and makes us wait an extra week wink "
8 more days! the countdown continues to continue        i think i might drive myself crazy before this baby comes!
"happy birthday to my son! i can't believe he is 10 already! he had his first football practice yesterday, he had to skip jr  peewee and go straight to peewee because he is so much bigger than the other kids, makes me kinda nervous but he is good at it and he loves it so i guess i shouldn't worry too much "
finally! my cell phone is back on!
getting stressed out! my sons father has decided it's time for his annual display of douchbaggery!
"went to the doctor today and she stripped my membranes, never even heard of that till today  but hopefully it will push this labor thing because i am 2 centimeters, so hopefully i will have a baby in the next couple of days!"
"thought last night was it but no such luck, just a lot of being uncomfortable and some semi-hard contractractions that did nothing but prevent me from sleeping! this little girl is already a pain in my butt!"
"well today is d-day! let'ssee if we can make this happen, i want to go for a long walk later but it was already 78 degrees by 9am so i might just have to walk circles around the dining room table, lol "
"still no baby but for some reason along with the swollen feet and hands my nose and lips decided to swell up too! very weird, called the doc and they said that happens with some women before they go into labor  my nose swelled with aubri too but never the lips  how the heck does <propfemale> <propfemale> talk with those things on her mouth?"
"finally! there is light at the end of the tunnel! (kinda literally, lol) went to the docs today and they are going to induce me at 7pm tomorrow, so sometime early saturday i should have my baby girl here!"
still only 4 centimeters after 9 hours! thank god for demerol! lol
"wow i kinda forgot how tired a new baby can make you  add to that a 4 year old who has decided she can't do things for herself anymore, can't believe i'm not delerious yet! thank god for my nieces <propfemale> and meranda, they have been here all week and are such a big help! the hubby finally got a couple of days off work to spend time with us, sooo looking forward to family time!"
"i am starting to come to the conclusion that if i am to take care of the baby, help aubri with all the things she wants help with (most of which she can do for herself, but won't), make time for cale, make time for the hubby, and continue to wallow in my ocd tendencies by keeping the house completely spotless and neat, then i need to make a clone of myself    possibly two  now to find a mad scientist somewhere       "
"finally got the baby to sleep, now the four year old is awake and trying to persuade me to let her in our bed  if i give in she will be sleeping in our bed till she's married, so i am now being forced into staying awake even longer until she falls back to sleep in her own bed    heres hoping she doesn't fake me out and wait till i'm sleeping to sneak in bed with us  sad "
cale had his first scrimmage last night for football and his team won! today he finds out if he is first or second string (fingers crossed)  daddy stayed home with baby by himself for the first time and after three hours he was ready to pull his hair out  sometimes he acts like a new mother that doesn't have a clue what to do when a baby starts fussing a little bit      men!
"does anyone know how to slow down time? i swear my life is running at the speed of light, either that or i am just functioning way too slowly "
"need to find a job, i am so ready to be working again!"
"so i figured out today that classical music helps the baby sleep, now i'm wondering if will help the 4 year old too? now i have to do some research, if i have to listen to it, it might as well be something worth listening to and not just whats on the radio "
"one kid off to school today, the other starts on monday, then it is blissful silence for 7 hours a day! no more \mom! brother farted!\"" or \""mom! she's looking at me!\"" 100 times an hour  instead they will pack a whole days worth of arguing into the hour and a half it takes to get ready every morning     oh well i'll take what i can get!"""
"so <propfemale> likes to play tricks on her mama! one night she will sleep for 5 hours straight, the next she is up every two hours and wants to play  needless to say, my internal clock is pissed at me right now!"
sitting here wishing summer wasn't over and trying to think of something cool for my dad on his birthday  happy birthday dad!
"aubri's first day of going to school for the whole day is tomorrow! she is so excited, i can already tell it's going to be a long night!"
"aubri's first day of school and already she 's telling me she hates the boy who sits next to her, i ask why and she says \because he thinks he can boss me around but he doesn't know yet that girls are supposed to be the boss!\"" i guess she is learning something from her momma! hopefully he learns quick or i'm afraid she might try to knock him out!"""
"trying to avoid having to pull out the winter clothes and go through them to see what still fits the kids, it's only september and already the leaves are changing and it's 59 degrees! blah!!"
good news! cale is eligible to be considered for pop <propmale> footballs all american scholar this year! i'm so proud of my smart boy smile 
i should really be taking advantage of the baby sleeping and start cleaning the house but for some reason i always end up on facebook! lol
texas hold em tournement tonight! heres hoping i don't lose all my money! smile 
i am patiently waiting for the day that i can wake up and actually feel like i've slept!
84 degrees new york! i love indian summer!
"i've carried a child within my body; comforted a baby on my chest  i have kissed booboos, mended broken hearts, been puked and peed on, woken up in the middle of the night to a feverish child and more, but i wouldn't have it any other way my body isn't magazine perfect, but when i look    in the mirror i see a mom   and   there is no greater honor or blessing  make this your wall post if you are proud to be a mom"
"so i got a job (definitely not the one i wanted!) but it will do for now, a paycheck is a paycheck  i haven't even went to work yet and i already miss my kiddies! sad "
"aaggh! i hate work, but i love the paycheck, just wish i could bring the baby to work with me, i hate not seeing her all day  sad "
"woke up to a screaming baby at 3am and while i was fighting my way out of the covers i twisted my knee, now i can't walk on it, gotta love it!"
"i think i need to work on my swing, life is throwing way too many curveballs at me lately!"
finally! this horrible week is over! now i'm going to sit in the rain and watch my son's first game of the play-offs! good luck cale!
"what kind of employer gives you a pay check drawn off a bad account, then tells you it's your own fault for depositing it in your bank account instead of cashing it at a store? obviously the kind i don't work for anymore! now he owes me $800 to pay me up to date and he wants to give me a check!ummmmm, how bout no!this guy really thinks i'm stupid and that pisses me off more than not getting paid!"

"so halloween is over and now it's time to startr planning thanksgiving, at least i got a head start on christmas, my mother has been bugging me for weeks now and yesterday i finally gave in and dis about 2 3 of my shopping  thanks mom!"
"i need to think of something big and e playful ensive that i want for christmas from my husband and i don't have a clue! i gave him his present early (a new 12 gauge) and he is upset because i told him i can't think of anything i really want  i know it's weird but i'm not big on receiving gifts, it makes me happier to give them and i hate when people insist that i must want something for christmas "
"fussy baby, vomiting four year old and 3 am     welcome to my life! aubri heard me tell her father that she has a stomach bug and in between all the dry heaving she keeps begging me to help her get the bug out of her stomach so her tummy will stop hurting sad  i finally convinced her that there is no bug and she's sleeping, now to get my fussy baby asleep and maybe i will be able to survive! ahh the joys of motherhood!"
"well that's two down! aubri had the stomach bug this past weekend, now my husband has it (and he never gets sick) hopefully it won't pass on to me or my son (or the baby!) even though my son has been using the \my stomach hurts\"" excuse a lot lately to try to get out of going to school  he gets upset when i tell him that i need to see spontaneous vomit for him to be able to stay home (i love this job!)"""
"well that's three down sad  the baby caught the stomach bug too, poor baby! spent all day at the er with her yesterday, thank god it's onlya 24 hour bug!"
"so the stomach bug finally made it's way to me sad  sucks even more because <propfemale> being sick for a couple days has completely thrown her schedule and feddings off, she has been sooo fussy at night (praying it's not colic!) heres hoping my sweet baby gets her sweet demeanor back soon, i hate it when she screams and cries and nothing i do makes it better sad "
so i have this virus that is kicking my ass! i have tried everything to beat it but i guess there are just some you can't win sad 
"dear god: if you could just please take this horrible, miserable disgusting, hacking up a lung cough away, i promise to never use the f-word again(not even by myself and especially not when some jack-ass cuts me off on the highway)! please, thank you and amen!"
"change your fb profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood  the goal? to not see a human face on fb til monday, december 6th  join the fight against child abuse, copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same"
snow!
sooo tired! was at the er all night with the baby and now the other kids are awake so i guess i'll have to catch some sleep with one eye open     
"snow day! i'm a really mean mom,lol, the kids were so excited that school got canceled today until i told them they had to clean their rooms (you can't even open aubri's door all the way because there is so much stuff on the floor!)"
"if you live near a bass pro shop and you have little ones check out their website, they have a winter wonderland set up in the stores for the whole month of decmber  the kids can do crafts, write letters to <propfemale> and get to meet <propfemale> (complete with a free photo) we are taking the kids to the one in auburn this weekend) they are soooo excited!"
thinks a long hot bubble bath is in her immediate future!
"you know there's a lot of snow when your husbands job calls a snow day! so now the kids are home and the husband, maybe i should call a snow day for myself?"
"i think i better go to the grocery store and stock up, we have a noreaster coming which probabaly means another 100 ft  of snow  i still haven't un-buried my car from the last storm!"
"i got all <propfemale> stewert last night and made a christmas centerpiece, i also superglued my fingers together several times, any ideas as to how to get superglue off without ripping off your skin too?"
"drinking coffee and listening to the baby talk to herself in the bedroom, she always wakes up so happy! smile "
"great! the baby learned how to pull the binky out of her mouth but she can't quite put it back in, so every couple of seconds she starts screaming cuz she's sticking it in her eye! lol"
"more snow! i have to admit, i really do love it (but that's probably cuz i don't have to go out in it unless i want to) anyway the kids are praying for another snow day, i guess we'll see!"
"i am going to brave the stores today for some last minute shopping, oh man, this is gonna be torture!"
just enjoyed a lazy day watching christmas movies!
"in loving memory:jack <propfirst> <propmale> october 7, 2005-december 20, 2005  rip baby boy "
panchito's taqueria = stuffed!
the baby has a cough and runny nose and since you can't give babies cold medicine any more we are making do with a humidifier and lots of snuggling  having a cold and dealing with sick kids is the worst thing about winter!
"convinced the hubby to cook dinner and it wasn't even that hard! just told him that i really miss his cooking and how he is a much better cook than me, poor guy his ego always gets him stuck doing things!lol"
"finally back home, my house is destroyed and i don't care! i'm up to my elbows in boxes and darn twist ties that hold the toys in the boxes, whoever invented those twist ties must hate christmas!"
"my dryer finally bit the dust! i have been dealing with the death cries for weeks, now i finally am getting my new set! now maybe i can get laundry done quicker since i won't have to dry each load 5 times,lol "
"<propfemale> got her first tooth! man, both of my girls got them early, good thing i can't have anymore or my mother-in-laws old saying might take effect and i'd have another one on the way in no time, lol"
"since i very rarely get out without the kids i am looking forward to not remembering much from tonight! happy new year everyone, here's hoping that 2011 is better than 2010 in every way!"
the sun has been out all day! i love it!
"sooo tired, the baby got her second tooth and i think she has a third one coming in, she is up every three hours    this is crazy!"
"aubri lost her first tooth yesterday and the tooth <propfemale> brought her two dollars! she was sooo excited, it's funny though, <propfemale> getting one tooth after another and aubri is losing them, lol "
"my husband is surprising aubri with disney <propfemale> on ice tickets when he comes home today, she is going to freak out, i can't wait!"
"went ice skating with my sister, hubby and the kids last night and now i'm sore as hell! i haven't went ice skating since i was 7 years old but i guess i better start practicing cuz aubri loves it! cale not so much, he spent more time on his but than on his feet, lol"
"do i work? uh yeah, i work  24 hours a day  why? because i'm a mom  i am a cook, a cleaner, a parent, a teacher, a referee, a nanny, a nurse, a handyman, a maid, a security officer, a photographer, a counselor, a chauffeur and a comforter  i don't get holidays, sick pay or any days off i work through the day and night    i am on call at all hours tell me your job is harder than mine  post if you are a proud mom"
"my son got in trouble for the first time ever at school yesterday, he and his best friend decided they were mad enough at each other to start fist fighting in class  now he's grounded and lost all of his priveleges, maybe i need to ground him more, he cleaned his room, shoveled the sidewalk and took out the garbage all without me asking  amazing how much motivation a kid gets when they are grounded to their room!"
"sweet girls come from the south, barbies come from ca, but ny girls have fire & ice in our blood! we can drive in the snow, handle the cold, beat the heat, be a <propfemale>, throw a right hook and drink w  the boys! we can cook a wicked good meal & if we have an opinion, you bet your @ss you're gonna hear it!!! -repost if ur a proud ny girl"

"kids are in bed, laundry is done and house is clean        aaaahhhhhhhhh       (big sigh of relief!)"

finally done at the dmv now i have to pick up my three little monsters and try to get home on time to cook dinner! so much for valentines day!
"so i usually don't get into valentines day, i'm not a girl who's into all that mushy crap and normally think it's a another holiday that makes people feel like they have to spend money on un-needed things, but my husband got me a card <propfemale> and flowers and the card was so sweet it made me start tearing up, so i guess valentines day is kinda ok but only sometimes       "
"so i took my civil service exam last year with about 1000 other people and scored really high, unfortunately for me so did a lot of other people  now i got a job offer with the state in the mail but it's for 3rd shift which is just about impossible to work out with two kids and a newborn  uugghh! i hate job searching!"
"lord help me! the hubby fell asleep early, so i was on my own with the kids, finally got them in bed 15 minutes ago and the baby woke up  never count on relaxing when you have kids! at least <propfemale> likes her swing cuz she is happy and quiet which is better than nothing i guess, lol "
while researching my family tree i found one of my dad's cousins that he has never met before  it's pretty cool he and his daughter are coming to my dad's so we can meet tomorrow  pretty exciting!
"so my hubbey got called back into work as soon as he wallked in the door  the roof of a church collapsed and they have to get all the snow and ice off the rest of it so it doesn't go down too  my poor baby, he works way too hard! now i need to make him something good for dinner, wonder what i should make?          "
