missing someone very much       can't wait to hear from her bestie!
i love my aunt theresa       she is such a goon!
"i miss you when something really good happens, because you are the one i want to share it with  i miss you when something is troubling me, because you are the one who understands me so well  i miss you when i laugh and cry because i know that you are the one that makes my laughter grow and my tears disappear  i miss you all the time, but i miss you most when i lay awake at night "
never take anyone for granted  hold every person close to your heart because you might wake up one day and realize you've lost a <propfemale> while you were too busy collecting stones 
"i get the best feeling in the world when you say hi to me, or even smile, because i know even if just for a second, i crossed your mind"
it's amazing how one little conversation can change things forever

"sometimes you think something is going to work out and it doesn't  when that happens to me, i just plan better for next time  if you want something bad enough, it will eventually come your way  i'm just waiting now     "
i love you  that's all  there is nothing else to say  wanna fight about it?
"i'm going to bed  the last 4 hours have sucked for the most part  without you wifey, i would probably go nuts  i love you"

"if i had a dollar for everytime you cross my mind, i would be a millionaire in a day tops "
is super relaxed today  smiles arent hard to find  thank god for great friends 
some things never change

"i think that everything happens for a reason  i dont know what makes me think that when really messed up stuff happens, but i do  oh by the way, i love you                   no <propfirst> not you"
the best dreams are the ones you never have to wake up from  you are my grandest dream                                        not you <propfirst>
"arrrrrggggghhhh  how am i supposed to do homework with no internet at home? go to hastings you say? oh ok  now how am i supposed to manage all that and two kids alone? oh yeah, i'm not "
i need a vacation from my children and my husband      ugh
"i love the way that no matter how sad or down i feel, with a word from you, i can smile again                                   still not you <propfirst>"
"so, if i give youmy heart, will it be your latest toy, or will you treasure it and keep it forever? i want you to have it regardless, i just wanna know if it will hurt later   wink "

"i need something, and i think you have it       gimme!!!!!"
"guess what, times are changing and so am i  time to grow up and get my head on straight  for now, you are kicked out of my head "
damn people for not telling the real story
if you wanna know         ask 
"why do ppl judge others when they dont know what they are talking about  hey! i know, someone tell me a quarter of a story so i can make judgements on it                    grrrrrr @ ignorance!!!!!!!!!!!"
i know i will be alright  i just need some time  will you hold me up while i try to find my way?

"i am working on my homework, and thinking about all the things that have happened this year  i cant wait for this year to be over "
i just got bitch-slapped by an effin peanut butter cup!
"i cant seem to stop thinking long enough to get anything done        too many questions, not enough answers"
"if you think running away will help me stop loving you, you are dead wrong  i love you today, tomorrow, now and forever "
i miss you  i miss talking to you  i miss you  i miss my friend 
thinking about the irony in life  good thing i know that everything happens for a reason!!!!!!!!
i dont know what i am doing  i really feel like i am on a merry-go-round that just wont stop 
i wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges 
when all else fails                       fake it!  laugh 
"is upset that some ppl dont answer their phones  today sucks, and i dont see tomorrow as being much better  bah humbug ish"
"there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel seems to keep extending itself"
"i would sooooo run away with <propmale> black                oh yeah, gotta love me some werewolves  vampires are great too  sigh"

the most beautiful thing in the world is a happy girl 
have you ever wanted to kick yourself in the face?
believe in yourself and all that you are  know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle  be happy for this moment  this moment is your life 
the decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story  it changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already has within it that surrender  ~emil ludwig
