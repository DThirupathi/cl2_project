"when you make a mistake admit it, i will think of you higher if you do, otherwise don't waste my time!"

"then, when walking down the street, i saw a child with eyes of blue; he stood and watched the others play, it seemed he knew not what to do; i stopped a moment, then i said, 'why don't you join the others, dear?' he looked ahead without a word, and then i knew he could not hear  oh god, forgive me when i whine, i have two ears, the world is mine "
i have noticed that all the creepy people decide to come out and walk when st <propfirst>'s school let's out
