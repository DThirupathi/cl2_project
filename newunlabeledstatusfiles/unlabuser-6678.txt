"the cold, empty, musty feel \a prison cell that isn't real \\a swirling torrent of pain\the madness claiming the brain\\escaping freedoms hold\lying in the cold"
"a ghost that's been haunting me can finally be laid to rest  i look forward to the future, with a little elbow grease and some smooth operating i should be able to squeeze some orange juice out of these lemons life keeps throwing at me "
and the next thing they knew they were being breached by a whale!
summer smash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it's been a great week so far   
tank watch    again
sons of anarchy starts in a matter of minutes!
"soaring, this life that seems to seep the strength from our every withering bones  flying, above the all consuming greed of our false thrones  \fiefdom,  the control that society holds is our own rage  freedom,  is a choice to open the cage "
do you ever feel like your trapped? like you are surrounded by invisible walls that only you can feel?
"me: yes what do i put for my ca adress on my ballot since i'm in the military in hawaii\clerk: if u don't live in ca you need to register to vote in hi\m: no, i am still a resident of ca i am registered to vote in ca\c: if u registered to vote out there then u registered to vote in hi\m: no i am registered to vote in ca, i think that's why i got a ca ballot in the mail\c: that's not right u need to call the hi office"
dear facebook: don't ask question you don't want to know the answer to  if you knew what was actually on my mind you would crash!
so my medical board got rejected    they want a line of duty investigation done on my incident     so basically they are going to try to say that it was my fault that i got hurt and they don't have to pay me shit  go navy   
why does it always seem that my list of shit i need to take care of is always full things that constantly wear me down?
"will the zombies come out and play soon?     i hope so, my machete is too clean!"
so yeah    road runner turbo plus installation= fail! the new management for my building changed the locks on the boiler room so the cable guys couldn't hook up my fast internet tonight    it should be up and running by tomorrow but until then i am still stuck with uber shitty clear-wire
woot chilin at my favorite place the tripler er
"lets see     so far 2011 is off to: waking up late for work, getting almost to base and realising that my id is sitting on the counter, almost running out of gas, and still no med board results   "
spent the first 30 minutes of this beautiful day praying to the porcelain god     i wish i could say that this doesn't happen almost everyday    
"i have decided that i hate the word \if\"""""
"somethings never change    somethings do  i'm chilin with cops, that are totally mackin on some doughnuts"
i think i am going to start using my cane to play a new game    whack a 'tard
my shit i need to get done list is almost empty    
"to all the friends i've made along the way, it's been real and you know what i'm about so just hit me up when you need some  to the navy     fuck you!  and once everyone i care about gets off the island i hope it fucking sinks"
"well i am home, home to stay  it is a great feeling and tonight has been amazing  and it's not even over yet  to all my peeps still in, <propfemale> in there someday the navy will stop making you grab your ankles "
do you ever feel like you spend most of your life waiting on one thing or another?
