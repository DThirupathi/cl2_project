"its one of those things you want to say,but you can't say it to their face;i wish you had a facebook so you could see how hurt you make me with the littlest things,but then again why i get so upset over them i will never know maybe its because i  internally demand acceptance from my peers for personal satisfaction about looks but why do i stress when i'm surrounded by people who love me?its because i'm human "
