i was so excited to post my new year resolution joke until i discovered someone else already came up with the same thing and executed it before me  from now on i'm just going to say whatever comes into my head as soon as it happens!
"yesterday sucked, as planned, but today has been excellent  a special thanks to glee for being amazing, windows 7 loving me and hp for making a huge 25 inch glossy screen  together you've made this awesome day possible!"
you know you're a designer when: you're helping your grama set up her new printer and you get distracted by the beautiful color arrangement of cmyk  fact 
"thank you <propmale> mccallum for revealing to me the awesome-ness that is <propfirst> crowder band's \church music\"" album!"""
"tomorrow will be the day i finally install windows 7, just to prove <propmale> cabrera wrong!"
time to get crazy and void the warranty on my old sansa e280 mp3 player with a brand new firmware install from rockbox org  it didn't have to come to this  all i ever wanted was for my 8gb microsd card to work!
