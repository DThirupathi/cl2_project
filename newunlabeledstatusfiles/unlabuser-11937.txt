"i try to make it through my life,\in my way, there's you\i try to make it through these lies,\and thats all i do\just dont deny it, dont try to fight this,\and deal with it  that's just part of it \i try to make you see my side,\i always try to stay in line\but your eyes see right through, thats all they do \im getting buried in this place, \i got no room youre in my face \dont say anything, just go away "
"hold on to the world we all remember fighting for, there's some strength left in us yet\hold on to the world we all remember dying for, there's some hope left in it yet"
"now i am mute despite myself, all of them are gone \the silence over takes me, the idle words forsake me and i am left to face me \i'm held accountable, for every idle word  curse the idle words   "
and its almost like your heaven's trying everything to break me down  
finding beauty in negative spaces  
"i don't have wings, so flying with me won't be easy   cause i'm not an angel, i'm not an angel  "
