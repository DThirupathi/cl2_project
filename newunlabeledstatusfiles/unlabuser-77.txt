"a post from a friend: there comes a time in your life when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it  you surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, focus on the good  so love the people who treat you right, pray for the ones who don't  life is too short to be anything but happy  falling down is a part of life, getting back up is living "
