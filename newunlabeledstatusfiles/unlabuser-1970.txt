do you ever find yourself standing in one of the rooms in your house    and you cant remember why you went in there   
"you know when you've been eating ice cream too fast and you get that frozen spot in the back of your throat, but you can't do anything about it because you can't reach it to rub, it you just have to kind of wait for it to go away    and it does    then what do you do   eat more ice cream!! what are we fucking stupid!"

"i done told you once, you son-of-a-bitch, i'm the best there's ever been "
1 presentation plus 4 classes plus three finals equals the end of the semester in 8 days
"procrastinating for one last time this semester  still got ten hours till the presentation is due, my money is on me not finishing till at least 2 "
"finally finished, thank god i practiced procrastinating in high school "

what was the greatest thing before sliced bread  ?
"well, i take whatever i want \and baby, i want you \you give me something i need \now tell me i got something for you "
"we're americans, with a capital 'a', huh? you know what that means? do ya? that means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world "

"shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more, and when everyone's dead try to ask a question or two "
"only one class not canceled, oh well i'll gladly take class over 4"
"life is about making mistakes \and death is about wishing you made a whole lot more "
i wish i understood how i could have done so well last semester yet have zero confidence in having a repeat performance this time around 
"calc test at 10, this could be interesting   "
here we go!
yet another test passed with much due credit to my ti-89
i really should stop procrastinating
this is complete bullshit   
"had a horrible day, regardless of the fact that it's <propfirst>'s day, thank god it is almost over and lets hope the semester begins to take a turn for the best "

"98 on my calc test    damn, was hoping for the 100"

knowledge is a blessing or a curse depending on your willingness to use it when it matters 
i love being at the shore where we are only getting rain  no more snow!
<propfirst> kornheiser was just singing friday lmao
do or do not  there is no try 
why do colleges insist on hiring professors who can't speak english  ?
"why is everything in college due at the exact same time, and just happens to also correspond to any plans outside of school as well "
"so is it sad that i procrastinated to a point where my class got the teacher to postpone the due date, then i procrastinated till that due date as well  ?"
