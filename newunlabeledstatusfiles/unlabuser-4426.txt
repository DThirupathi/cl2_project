"just to answer the burning question    i have never taken a bribe in my entire military civilian career, i maintained a secret clearance for over a decade, worked with law enforcement and was honorably retired from both careers  one should never presume to take assumptions for fact and then put them in writing for others to take as truths  even a stupid little questionairre can ruin a hard earned reputation "
"can't stay on any longer ya'll migraine is kickin too hard, time to get into my cave and hide from the light  "
time for yet another torture session with the pt people     grrrrrrr!
disenchantment     that's a good word for today  
"feeling used, unneeded, and unwanted      i feel that to someone all i am is a source of money"
thanks to all my friends who wished me a happy birthday!! i received the best present ever!!  the neurosurgeon agreed to the surgery to finally fix the busted up vertebrae in my lower back   i guess they decided that three years was long enough  lol
