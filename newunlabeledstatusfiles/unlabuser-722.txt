to my beautiful wife  i loved taking care of you after your surgery  i'm glad the surgery seems successful and you are feeling better  i will see you in the morning and will be ready to spoil you more  i love you with all my heart
i hope no one checks in on me  i'm going to sleep whether the bosses like it or not  got to be rested so i can have a nice day with my family
looks like another long night at work with nothing to do  maybe some day we will be off this site 
i have to get off night shift  it's killing me my girls are upset that i'm not home to play with them and tuck them in anymore
spent most of the day with livi  enjoyed the day greatly  feel bad that we have to take her back to the dentist friday to get a tooth fixed  she'll be fine though  they are going to gas her
finally! i have been giving something to do at work besides sitting in a parked truck  going to take the long way driving tonight
had the weekend off  work gave me day shift back so i won't have to get them phone calls from the girls missing me at night  all the boss wants from me is to drywall his daughters new house he's building for her wedding present 
don't worry about your problems  think of a reasonable solution
what a day  definitely found a new hurt  got smacked in the face at work with a hose and had to get 4 stitches in side of my nose  any ideas of piercing my nose are definitely not an option 
"day shift was fun while it lasted  back on nights again  we need more night guys, they scheduled me 84 hours this week  wtf"
i've never seen more monkeys trying to fuck a football then i have tonight  a bunch of old farts sprinting to load water then drive 20miles an hour  there is definitely something in the water  the trees are better damn company 
i just got in trouble for not wearing a hard hat while i loaded water  you know h20  fire me my head got wet
"beautiful day in the mountains  hot sun, blue skies with a couple little clouds  probably should be sleeping but no figure that later"
work is very boring tonight  they sent me to run for the other gas company tonight cause my normal company is having lots of trouble with there wells collapsing internally  oh well that got me off tomorrow night 
"its 2am and getting ready to get my last load, then its my day offand that will be spent working at the house  hopefully i won't be to tired to get it all done  these 12hour nights are getting long "
it is going to be a good night at work  lol   i won't be there  spending the night with my family  smile 
"at the dentist with livi again  she is so good about it  oh yeah, thanks sweetie for getting the day right this time  lol"
i think tomorrow i will go and talk to another company about a job  i might be able to get dayshift and 4 bucks an hour more  i don't hate the co  i'm with but they just don't seem to pay to good
