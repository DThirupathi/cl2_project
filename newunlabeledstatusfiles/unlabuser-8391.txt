"man now that i slept, i think i slept too much today  ill feel lethargic all day now    "
"man, time to get started and make my presentation for naval science, read some history chinese, and attempt to study some physics, but most likely will get distracted with sc 2"
"ok finished making my presentation, time to relax and go to sleep early, but i woke up at like 12-1 today so i don't know how that will work out "
