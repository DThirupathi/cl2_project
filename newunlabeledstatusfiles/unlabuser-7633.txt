thinking about boxing up those pictures of memorable days i dont want to think about anymore  need to get outta the house too 
one of my little brothers got his first write up today and has his first loose tooth im so proud!!  smile 
"and i'm done hopin' \that we can work it out  \i'm done with how it feels \spinnin' my wheels and \lettin' you drag my heart around  \and oh; and i'm done thinkin' \that you could ever change  \i know my heart will never be the same \but i'm tellin' myself i'll be okay  \even on my weakest days \i get a little bit stronger "
3ish hours till i load everything for the move
mission accomplished!
"missing my tx friends, glad ones coming to see me in a couple months!  smile "
big changes!
doesn't happen overnight but you turn around and a month's gone by and you realize you haven't cried  i'm not givin' you an hour or a second or another minute longer  i'm busy gettin' stronger 
i wouldnÂ´t wanna be in your shoes if they ever found you out you better be careful what you say it never really added up any way
"no, this ain't nothin' like what i had in mind for me  but then again, the future, now, ain't what it used to be "
"did i give my love too soon or wait too long? did i take it a little too easy, or put it on too strong? she was lookin' for love; he was lookin' for fun  yeah, men an' mascara always run "
"he said i was all he had ever needed  but love is blind an' little did i know, you were just another dead end road, made with pretty lies an' broken dreams "
all kinds of lyrics running through my head!!!
r i p  grandma hope you are dancing and smiling again in a happy place

curious to see how everything will turn out  things are looking good  smile 
serious case of the sniffles goin on but things are good  smile  nice to have a visitor at work last night smile 
"off work today, errands done  looking forward to later  smile "
"like if you have had to deal with someone runnin their mouth to try and cause problems  everyone has and this is not my first drama starter so you are not gonna phase me, find something better to do with your time  thanks "

"just got home from work, startin this xmas with sleep!! <propfemale> christmas everyone!"
"(poke)-me if u ever had a crush on me and still do   \(like)-this status if u think i am a good friend   \(message)-me if u ever wanted a relationship with me   \(comment)-on this if we have had good memories   \now let's see who's brave enough to copy this and put this on their status"
"just got off the phone with my baby  feelin so sick but he still had me laughin nd smiling, cant wait to see him tomorrow!"

"i'm grateful for my family!my mother's not perfect nd things have never been easy but shes always done the best she can for us mom, i love you!i don't appreciate ppl popping up after 18 years to start drama in my family nd being slanderous in an attempted vague way katie, you're becoming a mature adult nd you should be proud of that you've always independently made your decisions, i hope it stays that way "
"i'm a bitch!   unfortunately most women won't repost this  i'm a handful, i'm strong willed, independent, a bit outspoken and i tell it like it is  i make mistakes, i am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle  but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best  if you're a bitch repost this   i dare you  i'll be looking for the ladies who repost"
"drama, drama, drama    grow up! thank you "
