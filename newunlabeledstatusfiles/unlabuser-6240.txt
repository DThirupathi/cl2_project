"uhg, life is so chaotic lately  i wish i could drop everything and just take a breather  if only i could live in bliss, and then i woud be fine "
tool  is like novacaine for the mind  yet it opens my mind more 
don't know how it happened but i ended up listening to old aqua songs  laugh 
i need to find asylum 
probably not the best idea doing ylmxntrth research and listening to tool at the same time  this ylmxntrth stuff if looking like either an overly elaborate creepy pasta or and overly elaborate arg 
uhg  looks like i have less than 2 weeks to finish my summer homework  better start the next book now 
age is an illusion  it is an illusion because time is and illusion  age and time are inventions of man and exsistence doesn't use them  age is the measurement of how much time something has exsisted  time how ever is an illusion and that means age has no rule to measure by and thus it doesn't exsist  if people would just pull their heads out of their butts they would be able to see past the illusion of time and age 
i feel like i accomplished some thing tonite  i got a shout out from men who have beards and the women who love them    laugh 
so i just realized i have 9 days to finish reading a separate peace and then do 2 assignments on it  i also have one more assignment for their eyes were watching god  and an autobiography  god i hate honors english

"well i have a ton of work ahead of me today  i have to do a topic statement with supporting details, constructive reponse problems, a quilt(?), and a autobiography all for english for monday  looks like i'm starting the year with some tension with my english teacher considering i asked her what my autobio should consist of and she got snobby and told me to figure it out myself "
"i'm very different than the rest of my generation  i feel that i have a broader view point than the rest  i get and see things they don't nor ever will  they won't see unless they change this destructive path they are on  i come with a message  a message of hope for those who listen, and a warning to those who do not  there will be a mass calling and those who have liberated minds will be the ones to make it through "
"some time i wonder how correct descartes was when he said \i think therefore i am \"" for what do you do when you continue to think and no longer are?"""

in my confused state of <propfemale> reached out i tried to find solid ground of some kindto shed my doubt i was weary of my day to day fightwhere i was too tired to shout and in my search i found my light;the only thing i was sure about ?
so i feel almost awkward to say hi now 
"gag me with a spoon   nah, make it a spork  sporks are always better "

well the game went well  show went well  all is swell  i guess
"all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration  we are \all one consciousness e playful eriencing itself subjectively  there is no such\ thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of \ourselves "
gonna go run around town  <propfemale> with some friends
"so according to adults, they are the only ones who know how to love  its rather self righteous and selfish for them to think they are the only ones who can love  they forget when they discovered what it was  now i probably sound like the stereotypical angsty teen so i'm just going to stfu now "
so we managed to fit 3 people on a folded up futon to sleep  laugh  we're tards  idk what i'm gonna do today 
"wrapped around his finger, you can't see that he has manipulated the situation so that you are mad at me "

"in these hard times, when people have lost all hope for humanity and just get comfortable and watch us destroy ourselves, people turn to god  any god  something they can grab on to, to anchor them and give them something that won't vanish with man  but, finding god will not help for he can't even find us for we have been forsaken from his eyes "
"so it didn't go as planned  there was the theatrics i imagined, the outcome wasn't the one i hoped for  neutrality remained "
"so yeah, i got band practice in the morn and then over to <propfirst> <propfirst>s for more music  i wrote the lyrics to 5 songs and i only have the guitar part to one so we are gonna go work on it and the others "

i think i was born in the wrong country  i can't stand the decadence of <propfemale> in every sense of the word 
"borders are the gallows\\of our collective national egos\\subjective, lines in sand\\in the water, separating everything\\fear is the cause of separation\\backed with illicit conversations\\procured by constant condemnations\\national blood-painted persuasions\\here's my song for the free\\no, it's not about praise and publicity\\corprotocracy, what a hypocrisy\\aristocrasy versus democracy"
