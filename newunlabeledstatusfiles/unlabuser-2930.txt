"fell asleep around 7 smile 0 or 8, then woke up to ring in the new year and ended up staying awake laughing at my friend until 4ish in the morning  i am so tired but happy about the way my new year started!"
hope everybody had a great new years! i'm still recovering and trying to catch up on sleep so i can go to fort smith in the morning 
in fort smith visiting the family! still kind of tired from the new year festivities though 
woke up in ft  smith to some snow falling    hoping it is just a dusting so i can get home later 
just hooked the kids up with a webcam so we can skype once i get back to <propmale>  so far the test run has worked!
it snowed on me most of the way home and now it's snowing here    i think i've had my fill of snow for the day 
finally got my dsl up and running!
sitting at bale getting my oil changed! i hate waiting   
paying bills before heading out to work   
i got stung by a <propfemale>! my foot is still throbbing and i can't sleep 
was supposed to work today but decided to just veg out and catch up on my shows 
just got done cleaning the front half of the house  sitting here trying to decide if i want to clean the rest   
cleaned most of the house    dang! i have the bedroom and bathroom left for tomorrow and laundry    yuck!
"daven just informed me she has (3) sisters    <propfemale>, <propfemale> and aspen  (how cute!)"
ready for the weekend 
frustrated i woke up at 3 smile 0 in the morning    too late to take an ambian though 
got sent home from work for having pink eye! dang it!
about to leave to go see new <propfemale>! ready for some popcorn!
packing daven's bags so she can go spend a few days with oh meme    i'm going to miss her but maybe i will get some things accomplished around the house 
not wanting to work this week    ready for turkey day!
i am sooo glad to be home! i love the family but after a bit i just want my own bed 
starting my spring cleaning in the winter this year    it may take until spring to get it all done  spent 3 hours on the kitchen last night 
aspi will be proud    the bathroom is now spotless!
about to take the baby to dance then heading home to get more cleaning done 
just dropped the carpet fresh can on my big toe!  cleaning is a hazard!
tgif! busy busy weekend ahead but at least i may get to sleep in tomorrow 
got off work today to come home and work from home    i'll love the check but hate all the work i had to do to get it 
finally giving up on working from home for the night    hope everyone has a better friday night than i did! : (
awake and debating on whether to start work now or procrastinate a little longer   
just got done watching the sec championship game  just chilling with daven until bedtime   
now watching the big 12 championship    i'm for texas on this one  (i may be wrong )
"about to watch <propfirst> macguire    \you had me at hello \"""""
"since i'm doing a mushy weekend for movies i think i will watch \the notebook\"" """
time for bed!
almost time to start getting ready for work    hope everybody had a great weekend!
thinking about finishing the tree    maybe after dinner  lasagna tonight!
up but feeling like i didn't sleep at all   
upset that everytime i try to get this house clean the kids think it is free rein to destroy it faster than i can clean    i think i need the super nanny!
between the wind and the cat even my sleeping pill didn't work last night!
just got home    thinking of a hot bubble bath and a good book!
dreading taking out the trash this morning 
ready for the weekend  i think we need to all work 4 day work weeks so every weekend is a 3 day weekend 
just finished christmas shopping for daven  i decided to go for quality this year instead of quantity 
home from work for the day    debating going in tomorrow but i for sure have to go sunday  now i know why it feels like the weekend goes by so fast   
trying to get motivated enough to start on the laundry   
finally home from the bday party  i think i'm too tired to get off this couch for the rest of the night    <propmale> e cheese is like a workout for parents 
missing out on fun because i have to be at work today  i need a vacation!
i actually had the powerball this week! too bad i only had one other number to go with it  $8 is better than none though 
just got done cleaning up puke and now doing laundry but not the laundry i had planned on doing    my intelligent 4 year old decided to stick a marker lid down her throat and gagged herself which resulted in about 5 minutes of projectile vomiting onto my carpet  yuck!
where did my weekend go? i need more weekends and less weekdays   
busy week this week  tonight is aspen's choir performance  christmas shopping wednesday  daven's dance recital thursday  aspen's dance recital friday  dance christmas party saturday until 10 surprise 0 pm then hopefully a day full of rest on sunday  hopefully i haven't forgotten anything   
is it friday yet? i'm ready for this week to end!
pay day today! i hate to go shopping but i need to finish up my christmas shopping tonight and stock up on some groceries after i get off work 
finally finished with my xmas shopping for the girls! now the wrapping    ugh!
5 more days of work until christmas! i wish i was going home for christmas this year    if things work out maybe i can be in the fort the day after christmas to visit the family 
"home from the babies dance recital, it was so cute! tomorrow night is the big girls then we are almost done with this hectic week   "
about to head to aspen's xmas dance recital! i sure am glad this week is over finally   
home for the night  going to try to finish the new <propfirst> <propmale> book before i go to bed 
<propfemale>'s thought for the day: the worst thing a guy can do is make a woman fall for him with no intentions of catching her   
<propfemale>'s thought for the day: women always worry about the things that men forget; men always worry about the things women remember 
"watching my \baby\"" play and enjoying it  it is amazing how fast they grow    : ("""
it's my day off and i'm already awake!
"thanks to my dear friend <propfemale>, i have discovered the joy of scype  it is really cool i can now talk to my child face to face even if she isn't home "
getting ready to wake the girls up for school  i hardly slept at all last night so i am really going to be tired today 
home from work and debating on taking of thursday or just getting up early to go in and getting my 6 hours over with  : (
god i am tired! i think i've actually slept only 4 hours in the last two days    i hate to do it but think i will have to take a sleeping pill tonight  insomnia really sucks!
going to wrap presents tonight after work i have procrastinated long enough i think   
boiling my eggs so i don't have to do it tomorrow to make my lucifer eggs for christmas dinner    it's going to be a crazy night trying to get everything i need to get done done 
"eggs are boiled, presents wrapped  now i just have to clean out the car, finish laundry, pack daven's bags to go to her dad's christmas night, pack my bags to go out of town christmas night, change the cat box and take out the trash  i feel like i'm forgetting something but it will have to wait   "
"well, it's lightning here so i'm going to shut down my computer and unplug it from the wall  i have a few things left to get done  <propfemale> christmas <propfemale> <propfemale> to all! muah!"
why is it every time a holiday is near one of my family members decides to make me feel horrible    this time i was actually innocent  no wonder people get depressed during the holidays 
about to head to work    seriously thinking of craw;ling back into bed for another hour 
well according to the news the interstate is closed    think i will crawl back into bed for a few more hours  on the plus side we may get some snow around 5ish! <propfemale> christmas <propfemale>!
tried to go to the line but turned around  nothing is worth waiting in that traffic!
"ugh! this rain is getting annoying! at least they have 1 <propfirst> open on the interstate now  oklahoma city is in the middle of a blizzard, hope it doesn't get that bad here "
"find a guy    who calls you beautiful instead of hot    who calls you back when you <propfemale> up on him    who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats    who holds your hand in front of his friends    wait for the one who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares about you and how lucky he is to have you    wait for the one who turns to his friends and says, \   that's her \""   """
<propfemale> is in florida so it is time to cart the girls off to bed  <propfemale> christmas everbody!
"<propfemale> christmas! the girls already tore through their presents and now it is time for mommy to put together all the \assembly required\"" toys  i'm going to try to avoid those toys next year!"""
so glad this day is over! ready to eat dinner then relax the rest of the night 
"it is so offical! \hi my name is <propfemale> and i am addicted to criminal minds \"" i'm glad it is on almost every night!"""
about to cook mac&cheese for me and the baby and trying to decide what to do for new years <propfemale>    so far i'm leaning toward staying home and going to bed early 
"hoping today is a sign of what the new year will be like! i got home from work a few minutes ago and checked the mail  i got my electric <propmale>, which was actually almost a $180 credit! then i get out of my car and find a $5 in my yard! happy new years to me!"
"heading over to my friends house for fajita's around 6 smile 0ish    i have a lot of stuff to accomplish before then  it's going to be a new year when i wake up tomorrow, it seems like '09 just started    happy new year to everybody! be safe!"
"new year, fresh start! what will this year bring me?"
as my friend reminded me     it is actully 1 1 11! lol!
i am so silly! i actually allowed someone to break my heart 
already ready for bed! of course the 4 year old slept the whole way home so she is bouncing off the walls    got to love just getting home from a road trip  : )
time for bed    think i will run outside and freeze while checking out the weather  then go try to get these wild children to bed 
monday already    : ( glad the roads aren't too bad so i can get into work and get the girls to daycare  pcssd just closed so i'm hoping the daycare is open!
"i guess snow does something crazy to children    mine have been bouncing off the wall all night long  lol! i have to admit, i am guilty of going outside to catch snowflakes on my tongue  ; )"
"wow! i actually slept like a rock last night, it must be the cold weather    i almost turned off my alarm this morning instead of pushing snooze! that would have been bad!"
"finally sat down! dinner is over, laundry is going and now just a little bit of me time!"
"question of the day: how much snow are we going to get, if any? i know if i go to the store tonight it won't snow but if i don't go we will be snowed in all weekend "
sleeting here in <propmale>   
where is my snow?
black
time to get the youngest pee pot ready for dance    thursdays are not my favorite day of the week  it seems like all i do is rush rush rush 
tgif! no kids this weekend    i'm ready for a weekend of total me time! : )
ugh! had to turn down the heat at home so i can avoid doubling my <propmale> again next month    (like i did this month) i'm glad i have my trusty space heater  : )
"about to hit the sack    just went outside and it is cold! discovered no matter how cold it is inside, when you come in from outside your house feels warm!"
watching extreme makeover: home edition and debating on getting out of bed  my room is so warm with this little space heater that i could stay in bed all day!
about to take my afternoon nap! it is way too cold to attempt to get out of this house today    brr!
"sitting home tonight again, i have no kids tonight but not willing to brave the cold to go do anything  think i will pamper myself with a nice bubble bath and a facial  i may even repaint my nails   "
okay    survey time: how much did you get from the tooth <propfemale> as you were growing up?
don't you hate it when you wake up and you have 5 missed calls from a number you don't even know?
laughing because i had a total chick night with a guy last night    ice cream and old movies! lol! it is great to have friends like that

hate feeling under the weather during the work week    still going in though  : (
stayed up too late last night talking on the phone    what was i thinking?
"picked up the house a little bit when i got home, now i'm watching idol! sooo funny!"
"i learned a lesson today: never buy batteries from the dollar store, they die in kids toys in 15 minutes "
trying to get in the shower    too tired to function today  mom is having her pacemaker and defibrilator put in today and i didn't sleep too well last night    maybe i will take off around 2 so i can go up to the hospital 
taking daven to dance in a few minutes  after she gets out we are heading up to the hospital to visit with mom for a bit

wishing i was at the horse races today  : (
got to get ready to pick up aspen from her sleepover in a few hours and do some laundry so i have something to wear on my semi-blind date tonight  wishing i would have went to bed a little earlier last night 
"dressed and ready for my \date\"" now i'm starting to get nervous!"""
"so hollywood has brangelina, now <propmale> has daspenelli! lol! (daven, aspen & <propfemale>) the baby came up with it in the car on the way home from the movies and it has stuck "
"time to start getting the girls ready for church  trying to decide on what to make for dinner tonight    spaghetti, taco's or meatloaf?"
"i think i've decided on meatloaf, mashed taters and green beans  yummy!"
drill sergeant aspen came home from church demanding we all get up and clean the house    (she want's a friend to come over so she is really into this    notice i'm still on the computer!)
just woke up from my nap! very refreshed!
omg! not meaning to brag but that meatloaf was the bomb! mmm mmm! daven will kill me tomorrow since she is getting leftovers for her school lunch 
finally home from work and picking up the girls  glad this day is almost over 
can't wait for this weekend! no kids so it's time for the comedy club friday and a hot springs trip to enjoy nature for saturday  : )~
time for bed! yippy!
i hate nights like last night when no matter how tired i was i couldn't fall asleep! makes for a long day ahead  : (
"finally home for the night! don't think i'm going to stay up too late tonight, i'm tired   "
"it must have stormed last night    i woke up with a cat and two girls in my bed  thanks to ambien, i didn't hear a thing "
yummy! about to eat a stuffed bellpepper i picked up from mom and dad's house after work  i can't wait!
six months until my birthday! hello vegas!
enjoying the storm  as long as there is no hail or tornados i love a good storm    think i will open the blinds so i can watch the lightning 
is tired of the daily grind! i need to win the powerball or something so i can take a few weeks off 
almost time to get daven ready for dance then taking aspen to go shopping at this little shop we saw monday night 
<propfemale> looking forward to this weekend! no kids    looney bin    hot springs! (and on the 7th day she rested!)

"snow maybe on friday? what is up with this crazy weather? geez, i was about to pull out my shorts last week "
i miss the days of living at home with my grandparents and not having to pay all these bills every month    those were the good old days!
hates waking up in the morning after a restless night and then realizing there is no caffine anywhere in the house!
it's that time a year when i could really use a vacation    i'm burnt out from doing the same thing every day  a break would do me well 
"well, i think i will sweep all the mud up out of the floor from this weekend and maybe mop then it's to bed for me  night!"
waiting on the weather report this morning    doubt we will get anything on the ground friday but it's worth keeping an eye on (i guess) 
home from work finally! now about to start cleaning the front living room  the baby has it looking like a bomb went off and i am sick of it!
overslept from staying up almost all night    not wanting to go to work 
"snow? ice? just because i want a day off of work, i know we won't get anything at all "
okay my house is not so big that i should lose the mean cat in it    wonder where that cat is at? i'm needing to let the nice one inside before he freezes  hmm   
"put this on your status and see how your friends respond  if you know me well, you know that i am ____________, i love ___________, and i can't stand ____________  (this should be interesting)!!!"
wondering why <propmale> and <propmale> school districts are always the last to close? i'm going to be mad if i have to go to work then have to drive all over gods creation on slick roads to pick up the girls when they finally decide to close 
starting to snow here a bit    the daven is wanting to go outside to play in absolutely nothing    she doesn't know it's no fun until it is on the ground 
the daven has been on me since 6 to take her outside! thinking once i get some caffine in me i will take her 
omg! my daughter has me watching pooh    (tigger & pooh)
"just watched <propfirst> mcguire, god i love that movie!"
is laughing at how lazy i have become  i just called my daughter in the next room to tell her something instead of getting up and walking in there  gotta love cell phones!
really getting mad that every movie i get from netfix is scratched and skips! do they not check these things before they send them out?
dang it extreme makeover! you did it again    love to watch this show but it always gets to me 
my throat is sooo sore     hopefully when i wake up it will feel better 
great! my car has been recalled    guess i will have to clean it out and take it in 
"wow, i am tired! think today is an energy drink type of day "
"cooking dinner and trying to clean a little bit    i'm not too motivated, so i doubt much gets done "
"i asked my 4 year old to clean her living room 2 hours ago    just looked in there and she is systematically destroying it worse  she is the \ultimate destructomatic\"" """

"after starring at the ceiling for an hour, i gave up and finally just got up  never knew ncis is on at 4am in the morning   "
wow! finally home for the evening  i've got a load of laundry going and now i'm going to relax for a few hours 
is wondering why it is that the more tired you are through the day; the harder it is to fall asleep at night?
"well, i made it to pay day again  now come on saturday! time to party down for a friends birthday "
just got home now leaving again    going to go <propfemale> out with my <propmale> who i haven't seen since new years day!
is laughing at <propmale> brannon from todays thv; he just made a bet we would get 2 inches of snow over monday or tuesday in the weather garden  (i doubt he wins that one!)
"the 4 year old is playing wii, i doubt i will be able to get her off of it to go to dance tonight "
"i went to eat at applebees last night  really wish i would've been there the night before  all i got to watch was the police being called on people stupid enough to walk out on their ticket and forgetting they had to sign in with their membership number in order to drink  the night before somebody actually brought a horse into the place! i saw a pic, talk about a customer with a long face!"
finally off work! tgif but now i'm too tired to actually do anything but veg out in front of the tv 
4 am and i'm already awake    thanks to my ex-husband calling as he left a bar to see if i had beer  i knew i should have turned off my phone when i went to bed 
thinking i might go ahead and take a bubble bath before my hair appt and get pre-ready for the bday party tonight  then maybe i can get in a hour nap sitting straight up so i don't mess up my hair before we go out tonight 
taxes done! come on and hurry with the return so i can go to st  <propfirst> and gamble with my mommy!
wow! it looks like there may not be work again tomorrow    these are some big flakes 
so    i'm wondering if <propmale> and <propmale> are planning on cancelling school tomorrow  i wish they would decide to night so i don't have to get up in the morning to watch the news at 5 smile 0 am 
no school tomorrow! that means no work for me! yippy! snow days rock!
am i the only person that still has the old facebook layout? i saw the new one and i'm really not that fond of it so i hope mine doesn't change anytime soon 
it's so nice to see the sunshine today! hoping the roads clear up so i can get out and about this afternoon 
just waiting on the small one to fall asleep so i can run up to the store to do a little bit of shopping  we are out of everything!
made it back from harps! the roads are really drying out now 
spent all day thinking it was monday    lol!
hates being home alone when both the front and the back motion sensor lights light up at the same time! feeling a little bit creeped out    : (
no more snow please! i know the girls love it but i'm already ready for spring to get here 
"one daughter is out of dance for the evening, now just one more to pick up at 8 smile 0 then i am done for the night  hoping we don't get anymore snow so i can have a 40 hour paycheck at least one week this month "

seriously! when do the lies stop? i believe in honesty at all cost but others (ex-mother-in-law) think it is a good idea to teach my children the value of lying  how can you raise a child to be a honest child when everything you say is shot down by someone your child believes in?

"trying to find something good on tv to watch    no aspii tonight, just me and daven  all she watches are cartoons  any suggestions?"
"just finished watching steel <propfemale>'s, wishing i had fried green tomatoes!"
"now that it's all over, what did you really do yesterday that's worth mentioning?"
"got some of the house clean and a big dent has been made in the mountain of laundry that's been piling up  i've been very productive today, so now i'm just going to relax and watch t v  until my load of laundry gets done drying  i should sleep super well tonight!"
can't sleep!!!!!!!!! overtired has turned into unable to sleep 
glad i gave the youngest her bath last night    2 hours of sleep really isn't enough to function on so wish me luck on staying awake today at work 
ready for 5 o'clock tomorrow to get here    it's payday and no kids  ready to go <propfemale> out with one of my best buddies and laugh my butt off at his craziness 
time for bed! finally tired enough to sleep (i think) 
"well, i was planning on going to the horse track saturday but it looks like there is a 60% <propmale> of rain so i guess my plans are going to have to change  : ("
time for bed    go razorbacks! good game tonight 
off to work again  happy it's going to get almost up to 60 today!
getting ready to take daven to dance  wanting to go to bed already 
thinking of going out with my country boy friend tonight    to bad i got woke up after a 15 <propfemale> nap earlier  now we are trying to figure out where to go 
if people would just let me sleep my life would be so much better  i'm about to put a sign on the front door everytime i lay down so people will just go away without knocking  (including the jehovahs witnesses)
"okay    new plan for the day  get out of the house and play some pool  not really in the mood for cowboy  (i danced enough with 21 year olds two saturdays ago) i'm going to leave it up to my friend i guess, but if you have any suggestions, please share "
about to get in the shower to go out    man i feel old! it takes a 2 hour nap before i go anywhere these days 
sick of being sick    everytime the weather changes i end up with a cold or something  come on summer hurry up and get here 
home from walmart  spent way to much but at least now the girls have all their snacks so i can quit hearing about how hungry they are  lol!
so grateful for one of my friends bringing me some cold medicine last night! i might be able to breath a bit better today  : )
"daven has one more doctor appointment to go this week  she saw the dentist yesterday and the eye doctor today, tomorrow she gets to visit with the ear doctor  she has to be put under anesthesia at her next dentist appointment to get some work done on her teeth  i feel sorry for her!"
"oh great! my fever is coming back  no wonder i am feeling crappier by the minute, someone needs to make me a hot toddy and bring it to me  (i hear they work )"
"dance is over for the night, now it is time for tylenol cold nighttime and in about 30 minutes bed! glad this day is finally over!"
goodnight facebook world    my meds are kicking in and i am about to pass out  one more day then i can rest and recover from this darn cold all weekend long! bye bye work    hello bed!
tgif! hoping to relax and rest up this weekend 
finally home from the ear appointment for daven    she does have some hearing loss but it isn't too bad  no nerve damage so as she gets older it should improve  : d
p o ed at my cell phone company! they turned off my phone when i paid my <propmale> on the day it was due  <propfemale>'s! it's about to be a fight!
can't wait for next weekend to get here  heading over to ft  smith to see the family and play some slots!
"okay, my fort smith trip is officially cancelled due to daven's dad cancelling on her this coming up weekend  i was really looking forward to going to the casino   "
waiting on aspen to get home  fight #1 with my sister is over for this visit  let's see how many we have by the time she leaves (whenever that is) 
work work work     blah! looking forward to <propfemale> let's hope this week is better than last week 
wishing my doctor would have returned my call and called in my z-pack for me    i'm tired of being sick!
feeling the need for some applebee's tonight    needing my steak portabella  hoping i can taste it though   
<propfemale>
sooo glad it's friday! now hurry up 5 o'clock so i can start my weekend 
done with work for the week and thinking about taking a nap while my sister watches the little munchkin  it's been a looong week!
wow! i just made the most spicy meatloaf ever    if my mouth is burning i'm sure everybody elses is as well  it was good though!
was supposed to go out tonight but was just too tired  at least i refuse to go to bed at 10 on a weekend    lol!
is wondering why it is that through the week i can't get my youngest out of bed to get ready for school but on the weekends she is up as soon as the sun comes up? is it some kind of unwritten kid rule?
trying to decide what to lay out for dinner    i'm leaning towards tacos and burritos but i could do spaghetti with meat sauce  i don't have time to thaw out my pot roast or i would pick that 
about to get ready to take my sister to see her husband    then coming home to do some laundry and get ready to start the work week tomorrow 
mom took the girls bowling so i finally have my house to myself    one load of laundry in and now i'm debating on an afternoon nap 
is finally starting to feel better! took it easy this weekend and it seems like it helped 
loves when it rains at night  i didn't want to get out of bed this morning 
okay! my 4 year old just came in the living room and asked me if i could itch her butt! lol! talk about lazy   
can't wait for this week to end! it was so nice yesterday and being stuck at work gave me a bit of spring fever 
"ready for this weather to improve  this has been a horrible day! one child puking and one with a rash plus an 11 hour work day  come on day, please end!"
dang it! i can't sleep    have to be up in less than 5 hours but still wide awake!
weathered the storm last night  i'm glad it didn't get too bad  2 more days until my weekend can start  hope aspen feels better today and makes it through the day at school  love you baby!
getting ready to take daven to dance and pick aspen up from drill clinic  i need a nap! this has been a long week 
"giving up on fb for the night, it doesn't seem to want to work right  good night everybody!"
"glad it's friday, hoping mom will watch the girls for a few hours tomorrow so i can go with one of my friends to get girlified! good luck at dance tryouts today aspii! love you!"
"i am so proud! aspen made the <propfemale> middle school dance team! so did <propfemale>, i'm also proud of her! : d"
about to get motivated to get in the shower and run into work for half a day  hoping i get a lot accomplished so i can take a day off tomorrow 
just got home from a few hours of work and now i'm just relaxing    once daven falls asleep it is nap time for momma too 
poor aspii is sooo sick! just got woke up to puke on my bathroom floor    i'm too weak stomached to get it all cleaned up without puking myself! i'm about to go in for try number 3  : (
"thought of you with love today, but that is nothing new  i thought about you yesterday, and days before that too  i think of you in silence, i often speak your name  all i have are memories and a picture in a frame  your memory is a keepsake, with which i'll never part  god has you in his keeping, i have you in my heart  repost if you have a loved one in heaven"
no school for aspen tomorrow    she is still a sick puppy  i'm just hoping my carpet survives another night  : d
"my poor babies are both sick but at mom's house, so hello monday! poor daven was screaming with an ear infection last night and aspen is still puking "
"todays game - place of birth! everyone please play! you will find it interesting to know where your fb friends birth places are  copy & paste this on your profile, then put your place of birth at the end of this sentence : pryor, oklahoma"
both girls went to the doctor today and (5) prescriptions later hopefully they are on their way to a full recovery

"glad this week has started out good  i'm hoping for a pretty easy week so i have plenty of energy to fish this weekend with my grandpa, neice, nephew, aspen and daven "
"goodnight fb, time to get some beauty sleep "

it was entirely too <propfemale> up here to do any good fishing  we stayed out for almost three hours and didn't even get a nibble

"had fun in the fort this weekend, ready to go back soon! hoping next time the fishing will be better "
"kitchen clean, dishes washing and laundry is as done as it's going to get tonight  maybe after the baby has her procedure tomorrow i will have time to finish off a few more things, depending on how well she does after the anesthesia "
getting nervous about today    i really dislike knowing that my baby is going to be put under and drilled on  hoping they can avoid the root canals! wish us luck!
today has been a long day! waiting on my laundry to finish washing then heading off to bed 
learned to never wear pigtails when going out    i guess guys like that  lol!
"love wednesday nights, but hate thursday days! had fun with my girl <propfirst> last night though "
"lately it seems like the kids are out of school more than in school! i wish i could be off with them for good friday, i could use the break "

off to face my monday!
my computer has a virus so i am now on aspens mini  i'm not used to this little <propfemale> keyboard though!

graduation for my 4yr old tonight! shopping for food and supplies for camping then rushing home to watch the idol finale from the dvr  what did we do before dvr's?
today it seemed like everything that could go wrong did go wrong    ready for the weekend to get here and the fun to start!
more rain today  at least the chances for this weekend were taken out of the forecast just in time for fun in the sun!
why do they make us work the day before a holiday weekend? i'm going to be sooo distracted all day it's almost pointless to go in 
"well it's almost time for bed    the toe nails are painted, the car is packed, work for 6 hours then off for a good time with friends and \family\""  let's pray i don't break anything this weekend  : )"""
okay so i haven't even made it to work today let alone the lake and i've already pulled a leg muscle and think daven has a bladder infection or a uti    i'm really looking forward to this weekend but it's already starting off badly  : (
okay    bruised and battered but had a wonderful time camping  thanks <propfirst> and <propfemale> (and jimbo) for making it a great weekend!

daven woke me up this morning at 7am ready to go to playtime pizza  i got to spend the next 2 hours trying to e playful lain to a 4 year old that you can't go play until they open at 11   
about to finally head to playtime  it is funny how time gets away from you on saturdays 
had a good time at playtime pizza! it would have been better if daven had taken a nap first though 
ever have one of those days where you are just p'd off at everyone and everything? i guess nicotine really does have a calming affect    lol!
"so, i've decided    never to take my two girls to wal-mart for almost 2 hours on the day i decided to quit smoking  s-t-r-e-s-s-f-u-l!"
according to weather com the high is going to be 105 tomorrow and according to thv's facebook post it's going to be 106    how much hotter is it going to get before fall?
cheated and smoke two cigarettes today    : (
lol! monkey walking with my oldest    fail!
seriously not feeling too well    i think i'll just go lay in bed and read a book 
happy anniversary <propfirst> and jimbo! love you both! give the boy some    lol!
sometimes it is the small things that make you realize how much you actually have    loving it!
aspen said i have to post that we just sang the whole titanic song    so here is my post 
i guess when you quit smoking you realize how much you really wanted to curse people out while you still smoked  lol! back then you smoked a cig and guess what? you were all better once you smoked one 
daven is not going to school today  i'm going to take her to my besties house at least until i can get her in to see the doctor to make sure she isn't contagious  i have a feeling i know what she has but just have to make sure and get her the antibiotics to treat it  : (
"i am so thankful yesterday is over and today is a new day    i had a good night last night, but the day was the suckiest day ever  hurry up weekend, i can't take much more of this week  lol!"
starting to get worried about my cat    i haven't seen him since 6:15 yesterday morning and he is alway waiting for me at the door when i get home  he has become such a huge part of the family in the 2-1 2 years we have had him 
thinking about paying for an online class or two this semester    that means i will have to get a mmr shot again (even though i've had it but the record got lost in the shuffle and i am scared to death of all needles)  hmm   
"when stressed, facebook games act almost like a valium "
"every single one of you are on my friends list, as a result of a conscious decision  i wanted you there!! i am not only glad to count you as friends, but also as family  let's see whom my friends list actually pays attention  copy andpaste this as your status  i'll be watching to see who really is  i <propfemale> family& friendships "
finally got my computer back from daven  really not feeling like dealing with 2 fighting girls so i am sending them to bed early 
glitter nail polish + glitter lip gloss + futon = a beyond pissed off mother    fml!
"had planned on spending a stressful night with my family    even shopped, cooked and planned on making a cake with my nephew  on the bright side, i work with 3 hungry men so the food won't go to waste  bon appetit!"
"okay, biggest choice i will have to make all day  couch or bed for sleeping? both have their own special advantages  decisions decisions decisions    "
i promise that thinks are getting a little better everyday! and if i'm lying to myself just don't let em know  ignorance is true bliss!
for everybody starting school today: have a good first day of school! : )
"i can't believe they give homework on the first day of school! aspen had a good first day other than leaving her purse in her locker after school  don't worry world, her make-up wasn't in it! lol! daven doesn't start pre-k until monday "
had a good visit with my mom last night  now tgif! everybody have a good friday!
is currently fighting with daven's dad over me telling the daycare to call me if she wasn't picked up by 5:45  really? this is the most stupid fight ever 
ready for jimbo's bday party! so ready to dance my a** off!
i can not e playful ress the level of my anger    i should post a picture of the meth pipe i found in daven's dad's house  how hard is it to not do drugs for 2-1 2 days?
monday again?
2nd day in a row to wake up at 2 smile 0am  i wouldn't mind so much if i could get back to sleep  it's going to be another long day

getting ready to head to the lake with my girls!
home from the lake  thinking she probably should have used a little sunblock 
had a wonderful weekend! feeling great and looking forward to the week  : )
"i don't know what it is, but it seems like the weight of the world has been lifted from my shoulders  i can't remember being this happy and energetic in a long time!"
"is wondering why my child is sitting right next to me and i am talking to her through facebook    really? sad thing is, she will answer me through the internet on her phone  jk! loving the internet! which she now is telling me is the interweb    i'm lost to this new fangled stuff  lmao!"
today is going to be a great day! babysitting tonight!

redbull
tgif! <propfirst>'s graduation tonight then putting up the tree tomorrow with all the girls! i really want to do a gingerbread house    maybe i will get up early and try to find one before the girls get up tomorrow  : )
"today is going to be a wondermous day! the roommate is cooking breakfast for everyone, then we are putting up the tree, after that watching the sec championship game with my bestie and hanging out with her until the wee hours of the morning!"
i don't need an angel on my tree  i already have one in heaven watching over me    put this on your status if there is someone in heaven that you wish could be here with you this christmas 
i would give anything for a muscle relaxer and a pain pill right now   
wow! pvc glue can really get you high    especially when your roommate and his dad decide to glue the pipe together inside the house with no windows or doors open 
"question     who actually shaves their legs before they go to the doctor (just in case you have to get in that gown)? guys, this question does not pertain to you  girls, you can inbox me if you want "
really wishes doctors wouldn't tell you what they are testing you for so that way you wouldn't worry yourself to death before the test results come in    i little peace of mind goes a long way 
woohoo! we have water! thanks to <propfirst> for all his hard work yesterday!
daven is soooo cute! i just walked in my room to tell her that dinner was ready and she was tucked in under the covers with her back propped up on a pillow reading a book  moments like that just make my day and put a smile on my face  : )
tonight is the peak night for the geminid meteor shower! i'm really excited but i am going to freeze my butt off if i go outside to watch it    i'm thinking hot chocolate and a big fluffy blanket  i wish i had a car with a <propfemale> roof sun roof 
just got of the phone with my mom and really really getting excited about vegas! i absolutely can't wait!
why am i so tired? i feel like i could lay down right now and sleep all the way through the night   
shopping from 10 to 2! hopefully that will finish up all of christmas and the stocking stuffers so i can start the wrapping process   
stressed stressed stressed! only about one thing everything else is wonderful! i am so ready for christmas and to watch my girls as they open all the presents  christmas is going to be a great day! 7 more days! : )
so disappointed in human nature    just disappointed 
"just had the best conversation with my brother! when life tries to beat you down, it's great to have people to pick you up! i love you! my day has been made so much better! : )"
really not feeling well today    my bed sounds so inviting! i'm going to try to make it until at least 2 though   
came home early from work to a very pleasant surprise in my mailbox! i love une playful ected money and it couldn't have came at a better time! vegas is going to be much better now!
"for the first time in 372 years, the winter equinox and a total lunar eclipse will happen on the same day! now to try not to throw up again so i can go outside and watch it will be the challenge   smile "
"looking forward to being pampered tomorrow night  lol! a homecooked meal, nice conversation and a massage! i'm going to be so relaxed  : )"
doctors appoinment tomorrow so wish me luck guys! i am hoping for no stabbing needles    ugh! really don't like doctors 
"really slept like crap last night    :  \thank goodness there is only 1 more day of work after today, maybe i can sleep in on friday "
so far this day has stressful! my doctor had to change the time of my appointment which happened to be the same time as aspens school christmas program  i managed to make it to an earlier performance for 5 minutes before turning around and racing back to work  now i am sitting at the doctors  is it friday yet!!!!?
"overall, my doctors appointment wasn't so bad today    i finally got a prescription for pain and she is sending off some more blood work  maybe just maybe i will have an answer before my appointment with a specialist on march 30th!"
i need some motivation to get up and start wrapping presents    does anybody know where i can find some?
next year i may need two trees! i guess i could do one for each living room    or maybe instead of buying presents we could put all the money we would have spent towards a nice vacation?

off to christmas <propfemale> dinner with the family! : )
"where is a tech savvy person when i need them? the good thing is, i've got the computer up and working  the bad thing is, for the life of me i can not get it to connect to the internet! really? i'm sure daven would love to go on some of the kid sites to play games   kiss ("
"i'm a few minutes early, but <propfemale> christmas! time to get to bed because 6 o'clock comes pretty early "
preheating the oven for my biscuits then will start on my chocolate gravy! about to drag out the camcorder and make sure it's all charged up

"â€œlove comes to those who still hope even though they've been disappointed, to those who still believe even though they've been betrayed, to those who still love even though they've been hurt before â€�"
2010 will you end already? i am so looking forward to 2011!
"really just wanting to get in my bed, pull the covers up over my head and hide from the world   "
"i just couldn't get to sleep and stay to sleep last night! ugh! now i am totally exhausted, and running late!"
zumba time!
"well, goodnight facebook world  i am tired and hoping sleep happens     crying "

"so glad today is \friday\""! bring on my 3 day weekend already!"""
my 3 day weekend has officially started! i'm already in my night clothes and relaxing at the house 
"my puppy is eating my house! i've been looking for an excuse for a new bed but really? i'll have to wait until he gets over this chewing phase, does it ever end?"
thank god this is almost the last day of the year! new year = new start! bring on the fun and games! : )
"okay, so i guess it's zumba time    i need to get it in before it starts storming  since we lose electricity everytime the wind blows "
everybody have a great new years! i think i am boring my date! lol!
new year = new guy! they just keep getting younger and younger    lol!
could not sleep at all last night! ; (
"just for once, i wish i could not work all day just to walk into a disaster area at home    my sister and my oldest daughter have managed to lounge on the couch all day while destroying the kitchen and obviously not watching the youngest since now there is silly string all over my living room and i can barely see the floor in the sunroom! happy new year!"
time to go to bed! i have to get my sister to the airport bright and early in the morning before going to work  i'm trying to make sure i've got enough energy left at the end of the day to watch the sugar bowl! go razorbacks! wps!
"Â¨Â¨Â°ÂºÂ¤Ã¸ ? ?woooooooo pig \ sooie   ? ?ÂºÂ¤Ã¸Â¸â€žÃ¸Â¤ÂºÂ°Â¨Â¨Â°ÂºÂ¤Ã¸ ? ?woooooooo pig sooie ? ? Â¸â€žÃ¸ Â¨Â¨Â°ÂºÂ¤Ã¸ Â¸â€žÃ¸ Ã¸Â¤ÂºÂ° ? \ ?woooooooo pig sooie ? ?

wtf was that?!!!!!!!!!
take that! lol!
ugh! were we even on the field on that one?
really? why didn't we run that one?
"looks like our offense and defense may be picking up! lets pull this one out and start blocking for our qb  (oh and hold onto that ball, please!)"
very pretty throw and catch!
over 7 minutes left and within 5 points! we can and will do this! can we get an interception in our favor?
okay    how many times can mallet throw at a target and the target not hold on to the ball? how many missed passes is this?
"we have the ball, we need to run out of bounds to stop the clock and have no injury timeouts "
"it was a great game and a great year for us    it was more than mallet, it takes both offense and defense plus a great qb  our offense and defense had some problems and yes so did mallet    either way    go razorbacks! (we just messed up on a few plays )"
"just had an amazing night at <propmale> e  cheese! aspen actually likes this guy, it's a miracle! she has hated every guy i have ever dated "
i may never sleep tonight! heading to vegas for the first time ever tomorrow and i am absolutely hyped up!
say a prayer that i win lots of money and don't end up married to an <propmale> impersonator    lol!
i don't think the party ever stops here!
job interview tonight! 2 weeks a year at 1000 a day! i won't complain

i am really craving some carino's! dinner tomorrow maybe? yum!
tgif! that is all i have to say 
"if you <propmale> two rabbbits at the same time, you are bound to lose both    \csi\""\",3bbbc7e26e622293b1b194cfc392a340,"okay, i'm just saying    what mom would come home to a huge mess on her counter, give a big smile and grab 1 paper towel? i mean really? i'd be whooping some butt!"
"dae dae did the cutest thing ever tonight and i almost cried from the sweetness! aspen and i were watching titanic and at the end aspen jokes around and says, \i need a tissue \"" daven gets up and runs to the bathroom (all the time me thinking she has to potty) and comes out with a tissue for aspen  that was priceless!"""
"i know usually we hope for some snow, but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that we miss it this thursday  i have a full weekend planned and i don't want it to snow on my parade!"
really keeping an eye on this winter weather    i don't want to get stuck away from home 
"to late to take a sleeping pill and to hyped up to sleep    either way, tomorrow is going to suck!"
"let it snow, let it snow, let it snow! (but not stick)"
<propfirst> aldean tonight! i can't wait!
i had a great time tonight    i see the beginning of the end 
i had a great time last night! it's funny how you run into people you haven't seen in 10 years and they still look the same!
i missed him so much! i'm glad he is here to cuddle up to and watch a good movie with  he just needs to pick better movies!
about to start vacuuming    does anyone want to do it for me? i really just want to sit here and relax 
really wish i'd either start feeling better or go ahead and get sick and get it over with! i'm tired of waking up with a sore throat and unable to breath   
"so, i efiled my tax return today and due to the repayment of the first time homeowner tax credit that i am paying back    irs will not accept my return until the 14th  i could have saved the efile fee and just mailed the stuff in "
i don't think i have e playful erienced anything more funny than watching a 5 year old dance to dance central on xbox! lol!
"ok    don't leave me hangin' my friends!!! how many of us know everybody on our facebook list? here's a task for you, i'm requesting all my facebook friends to comment on how we met  after copy this to your status so that i can do the same to you  you'll be amazed the results you get!     really sorta scared to participate in this   hahahahaha!!!\ "
"feeling like i don't even have a boyfriend anymore     : (\oh boo hoo! lol!"

feeling a little bit better today    glad the snow is missing us here in <propmale> 
"i am so tired of being nice, so i'm just going to quit and let people suffer    no more lending money, no more letting people run all over me  let's just say, i am fed up  hell hath no fury! so just don't fudge with me!"
"brr    it's cold! pay day finally so i can hit the grocery store tonight and restock the fridge and cabinets! forcast for today: groundhog will see his shadow, so six more weeks of winter  : ("

1-3 inches of snow maybe on friday? what is up with this weather lately?
was just checking my dvr and realized i have the new season of bones recorded! that is a total win!
"if i get all the way ready for work and wake daven up and then <propmale> and <propmale> decide to cancel school, i am not going to be a happy camper   sad "
it officially took 1-1 2 hours to get from work to the daycare and back home    these people are idiots! learn to drive or stay off the roads!
"interesting fact of the day: it is socially acceptable to date someone twice your age plus 8, so that means i could date anyone from 23 to 47  lmbo!"
let me try this again    my baby girl aspen is competing in the espn uda national dance team championship tomorrow! i couldn't be more proud of her unless i was there  you go baby girl! stomp the yard!
how are the roads? i haven't been out yet 
"had a great time in nashville, went cruising the dirt roads and seeing the sights  lol! i love small towns!"
time for the super bowl!
so wishing daven would have been in a better mood so i could have went to watch the game at my friends house   
"sometimes, it takes looking past the winner to realize it's the one in second place who was classy enough to concede rather than be cutthroat   "
loved the camero commercial! it was great!
"i would like to say i went with the wrong team, but i'm still steelers all the way!"
really needing to go deposit a check in the bank and pick up some cat food but not looking forward to fighting off the crowds at harvest foods   
the snowflakes are getting bigger and bigger! the first time i woke up there was nothing on the ground and now it is already covered   
"the snow just started and there has already been a fatality wreck! people if you don't have to get out don't, whatever it is you feel is so important and can't wait is not more important than your life "
okay    so what is it about being stuck in the house that makes you want to eat everything in the house? i am absolutely starving!
just watching movies and snuggled up with the girls! this has been a really great snow day for me!
need more sleep!
wow! chocolate gravy rocked! now the belly is full and the eyes are closing   
"<propmale> school district is closed tomorrow  the roads are pretty clear, why is it closed?"
"i'm really missing my <propfirst> already! it's okay, we can celebrate a week late becasue some things are worth the wait   "
happy valentines day!
"it really doesn't feel like valentines day today    oh well, i will just call it an early night pretty soon and play catch up on some sleep "
i think i have to much on my mind right now    i went to bed early but tossed and turned all night 
i am going to register my youngest for kindergarten this morning! wow she is growing up way to fast!
very much looking forward to this weekend! friday cannot come soon enough!
"can anybody suggest a good champagne? i never drink the stuff so i have no clue but want to buy some to go with my <propfirst> present to my bf    p s  please don't name the most e playful ensive one on the market, just a nice economical one will suffice "
"my bed has been calling my name for over an hour! the earplugs are no longer working, so i guess i will go to bed just to get it to shut   "
yippy! the irs finally processed my tax return!
i can't believe some people! who in the world could dump (3) little puppies on the side of a busy street and just drive away? they barely have their eyes open! now i have (2) of them since some nice people at petco took (1) of them  bottle feeding baby! every (2) hours is going to suck!
happy <propfirst>'s day to me! finally! this is going to be a great weekend!
i had a wonderful weekend with a wonderful man! he was awesome with the puppies which just makes me like him even more 
i walked into my house at 6pm and started cleaning (with a small pause to talk to a great person when she came over)    i just sat down for the first time and man do my feet hurt! the house is spotless (all but my bathroom and a few organizational things)! where in the heck has this energy been?
is this day over yet?
dont let the sadness of your past or the fear of your future ruin the happiness of your present 
i can't sleep! things are kind of crazy right now but i know in the end that everything will be okay    i just can't stand this waiting game to see what exactly is going to happen and when 
my boyfriend was supposed to come up to visit but he is sick so it looks like it is going to be a movie night with netflix   ):
took the puppies to the vet today and they are on their way to being healthy    rafferty weighs 2lbs 5oz and razorback weights 7lbs 8oz!
i'm so happy! my boyfriend will be sitting in my driveway when i get home from work! (and it's friday!)
it gets harder to say good-bye every time i see him    i think i may be smitten 
well the cows are laying down so i guess we are in for some rain today    i'm about to get my taco <propfemale> on though so let it pour!
i felt an earthquake in arkansas    my whole house was shaking and it woke me up from a very nice sleep 
i am so tired! that earthquake really messed up my beauty sleep   
"cousins are the first friends most people ever have as children  no one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins  even if you haven't talked much lately, re-post if you have some of the best cousins in the world!"
tossed and turned all night long    i hate nights like that 
"today has really sucked! started out with forgetting my lunch on the table, then called the irs only to learn that the refund i was supposed to get today hasn't been processed and it will be up to 4 weeks before i see it, then i called the store i ordered my new smartphone from only to learn that they forgot to ship it "
"it's wednesday (pay day) and no kids tonight    once i get through the work day i am coming home, grabbing a bite to eat and turning off my phone for some much needed relaxation time  today is going to be a good day!"
so my night of relaxation has turned into a night of work    dang it! at least i'm caught up (almost) 
i'll have some really cute and almost potty trained puppies ready to find a good home in about 5 weeks    i just want to make sure they get all their shots first  they will be 12 weeks old then! let me know if you want one!
just noticed that my plum tree is starting to bloom! now i have to pray we don't get a hard freeze so i can have some plums this year 
new phone! yippy!
yesteday  at  11:20am a great person was called home  i am so glad i had the <propmale> to have him as a teacher and mayor in my life  rip <propfirst> baker   
had the best weekend ever with my wonderful boyfriend!
"tipsy (my cat) was playing near my computer and i told him, \if i find <propfemale> porn on there i'll know who did it!\"" lmbo! i have no clue where that came from  it just popped out! wow!"""
i need to download some apps for my new phone    any suggestions?
my phone is really starting to pee me off! it won't ring and now my alarm didn't go off! and they call this thing a smartphone?
"you and i wake up in a psychiatric <propmale> together  using 4 words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well   be a good sport and play along    4 words is harder than you think "
"you and i wake up in a mexican prison together  using 4 words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well   be a good sport and play along    4 words is harder than you think "
angry birds are making me angry!
i think i've finally burned myself out on setting up this phone    i resisted a smartphone for way to long and now i can't put the thing down!
this weekend is supposed to be beautiful! i can't wait to get out and enjoy the 70 degree weather on saturday!
i really need to clean this house    is there an app for that?
note to self: don't leave an open beer and two puppies on the couch and walk away to prank call your preteen    they will spill it and they will drink it 
"today is supposed to be so beautiful and i'm going to be stuck at work    : ( \i think i may be coming down with a case of spring fever, maybe i should just stay home "
beautiful day! going to get out and detail the car and enjoy the sun 
"i love youu( annoyed --hackedd buy yo daughter aspenn! love "
it always makes a mom feel good when her child wakes up and asks for an orange rather than sugary cereal or a pop tart  maybe i need to keep the fruit bowl on the table permanently  : )
really not feeling very well for some reason    i'm going to pop some vitamin c and keep my fingers crossed that this yucky feeling goes away 
hanging out with some of my favorite boys tonight! wishing tomorrow was a holiday so i could stay up all night and actually do some quality hanging out    ):
"i am so ready to show my <propfemale> tomorrow! kiss me i am <propfemale> and i am going to celebrate my butt off! in a calm, yet fun way! (kids)"
okay    so when my phone company changed my plan to the smartphone plan they wiped out all of my roaming minutes so i am currently without a phone until some time on sunday  fml!
heading to texarkana for dinner with the bf's friends    yum! <propfirst>'s eatery or something like that

"when i was growing up, i thought parents were supposed to be there for their children  now i am wondering    did my parents get that memo?"
sitting here listening to the thunder roll    it is so relaxing!
putting on my pj's then cuddling up in the recliner with my snoring puppy    you can't put a price on evenings like this!
<propfemale>'s rant of the day: enough of this number game! it is driving me crazy! when you are gone almost 12 hours a day it's hard to catch up! please find a new game that involves chat or start answering by inbox! thank you 
dr  appointment tomorrow    wonder how much this is going to cost me?

"very happy! the house is clean, the dishes and the laundry are going and now i can wake up to a clean house in the morning! : d"
life without dancing    is that a life at all?
"it is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere  - <propfemale> repplier"
"this weekend has been one of the best weekends i have had in a long long time! i got to see some friends i haven't talked to in a while and spent some quality time with the boyfriend  now, relaxing and having some family time with the girls "
really wishes this rain would go away  the wind kept me up all night! this is going to be a long monday   
it is way to cold outside this morning    makes it hard to get out from under the covers and get motivated to start the day 
in ft  smith to look at a job    wish i could squeeze in a little time for the family but i had to ride with other people   
finally home! i'm am so happy that someone invited take-out so i don't have to cook tonight 
had a horrible night of sleep!
confusilated    what to do? what to do?
only 11 more days until i break the 3 month relationship curse! woot woot!
off to get the girls from dance then homemade pizza! yummy in my tummy!
i am so glad it is friday! now all i need is the day off and this day would be perfect   
"well, that was an interesting conversation   "
wow! it's going to be almost 90 degrees today! i was thinking of mowing the yard but i think i'll wait until the evening hours to do that  i want to putt putt instead 
"got the yard mowed (at least the front yard) may start on the back around 3  in the meantime,  daven and i are going to plant some plants "
took mom and dad out to dinner then shopping with daven  we bought two of those guns that shoot the foam disks and i am so excited to have an all out war with them! sometimes i think i am worse than the kids    lol!
"time for sleep it's time for bed  i need a place to lay my head     laugh \ahh! found it! night facebook!"
going to  the bank tomorrow to try to get a <propfemale> to purchase another 2 acres of land  wish me luck!
hurry up weekend! i'm ready to get out of town for a few days 
potential for overnight tornados    i can't sleep when i know there is going to be bad weather  somebody needs to gift me a noaa weather radio so i can sleep in peace 
i am very impressed with notify by the weather channel! i signed up for it last night for a 7 day free trial and i love it! unlike the noaa weather radio it only called my phone when a warning was in saline county so i wasn't woke up for warnings in other parts of the state  you can also change what alerts you want notified of (i chose only warnings and didn't include the watches) 
i thought i was keeping my children safe by getting them into the safe room but apparently i failed  daven was bit by a spider and is now covered in poison <propfemale> 
"a florida fan, an alabama fan, & an arkansas fan are climbing a mountain & arguing about who loves their team the most  the florida fan insists that he is the most loyal  ''this is for florida!'' he yells & jumps off the mountain  not to be outdone, the arkansas fan is next to profess his love for his team  he yells \this is for the hogs!\"" & pushes the alabama fan off the mountain """
"god, <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, courage to change the things i can, and wisdom to know the difference "
"everybody please lift my boyfriend up in your prayers    i'm not very good at this, but i think this is one of the hardest things i have had to face for a bit "
"i think simple is better  we played \life\"" and \""battle of the sexes\"" and had a great time! who needs bars and drama when the best thing is sitting right in front of you?"""
ready for bed    yawn! missing him already  i did get to meet some of his family this weekend and that was pretty fun 
"before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes  that way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away - and you have their shoes!  smile "
"stressed stressed stressed! deep breath, deep breath    i can't face this week!"
is it over?
"lately it seems like all i ever do is wait    for somebody as anxious as me, waiting is next to impossible "
going to try to get some sleep    the storms are over and my boyfriend is doing well  thank you guys for the support and i love each and every one of you  : d
just left the hospital and everything is going great! he is out of icu and in a regular room  he is having some problems with his balance but the doctor said that is normal  : d
i can't sleep! to late to take a sleeping pill though  i wish there was a switch that would turn this little brain off  sleep is good!
my throat is starting to hurt just in time for the weekend 
listening to the frogs    i love the sound of them and it is loud tonight! ready to open the windows and enjoy the country sounds in this big old city of <propmale>!
happy easter! i've been up since 5 smile 0 cooking my pot roast for today and i'm about to start working on my deviled eggs  this is going to be a long but fun day!
so i guess i have no clue what to do anymore    i am never right  where are the days where kids listened and did not talk back? i am so glad tomorrow starts a new week 
it was so great of my work to let us leave early so we would have time to pick up our children and get home before these storms hit  they are saying it will be around 6pm when it reaches us and that is usually right around the time we would get home and sometimes we don't reach home until almost 6 smile 0pm 
no power but think the worse from this one is almost over   
good morning! getting ready for another round of storms today and in to the night  just got power back around 2 am  this stuff is making it hard to get out of bed and go to work  i think the whole state is suffering from lack of sleep   
i've decided that the stuff falling through the cracks is confetti and i'm having a party!  ~betsy caÃ±as garmon
had fun today! took rafferty with me to pick up aspen from dance and only had 30 minutes to kill until daven got done so we went and flew kites in the field behind the dance school  daven got to fly one once she got out of dance and that is the first time she has ever actually flew a kite 
"i know this breaking news will be a part of future history books, but dang obama hurry up and make your speech so i can get some sleep!"
"well, i'm going to turn my concerns to my home state    everybody that is facing flash floods please stay safe  arkansas has been battered and bruised lately and seeing how we all pull together to help each other i can truthfully say i am happy to be an arkansan "
really? over 2 more inches of rain today?  i'm getting tired of this rain   
"now i lay me down to sleep   one less terrorist this world does keep   with all my heart i give my thanks   to those in uniform regardless of ranks   you serve our country and serve it well   with humble hearts your stories tell   so as i rest my weary eyes   while freedom rings our flag still flies   you give your all, do what you must   with god we live and god we trust   amen"
i'm really not liking this new medicine  it makes me drowsy and since i am taking it twice a day i'm always drowsy  ):
i have fell in love with the history channel    i really am getting old  lol!
pay day and hump day! life can't get any better than this!
taking daven <propmale> to the doctor for her kindergarten physical this morning! my baby is growing up so fast  ):
