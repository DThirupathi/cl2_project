"warning: this news feed is for the stupid people who don't have the guts to tell another adult that you just don't like them or care for them but because you work together you will be cordial with one another  for you who have a \problem\"" with someone because the person you happen to be sleeping with has a \""personal problem\"" with a person  i don't understand why you and yours have nothing better to talk about but me"""

"sometimes the truth hurts, but if you'd rather be a coward and not hear it, then don't e playful ect anything to get better! sometimes the best thing to do is change that means leave people behind sometimes, that means doing things differently sometimes  in order to get what you never had, you have to do something you've never done!"
"don't be upset, i have out lived the e playful ectations you e playful ected for me! that's what i am suppose to do, you cannot define what i am or shall be, nor can you tell me how far i can go in life  you cannot e playful ect me to live to the vision you have for me, i have my own vision in life, so if your vision doesn't match up with mine, then yours doesn't matter!"

"oh my! i am sooo hungry! i can taste the melted cheese in my mouth, the hot pepperoni going down my throat, and the italian sausage landing in my stomach! i just want this pizza to come out the overn already!"
today was a beautiful day! i have to keep reminding people that i am not moved by their emotions and insecurities  on that note i'm going to bed with a shakespear thought: this above all to thine ownself be true  no reason to fake the funk!
"man, real eye opener! my husband is the best, just enlightened me with some vital knowledge  this year is going to be the best year ever and i am so excited for all the change!"
"oh how i love jesus! today was a wonderful day, i'm so glad that my heavenly father does things his way in bigger ways then my mind can conceive! i'm blessed to be a blessing!"
