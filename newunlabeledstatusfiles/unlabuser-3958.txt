is reading the good book now    bot the other one lol don't worry dad i am not secretly conspiring to become a nazi!!!!
by the way i am not crazy i just hve an interest i how people who are very different from me think  i like geting inside their head   how else could i ever learn about something if i don't find out the facts myself   you think i actually blieve everything that comes out of peoples mouths??? usually the ones who say the most and pass the harshest of judgements really know nothing at all    
ignorance is one of many plagues of our society today   speaking without thinking    selling false truths without any facts to back them up  i seek real truth   not the contamination that continuously spews from human beings mouths without stopping!!! okay i amof th soap box for a bit sorry   lol
finally have my computer up and running thank god! also a praise report   turns out <propmale>s ears are just fine!!! had my first night at school and tomorrow will be <propmale> and adrians!! <propmale> is excited   adrian   not so much!!! finally about time for bed!

okay i made a post that i totally misunderstood for those that saw    oops!! sorry bout that  thank you <propfirst> clarifying!! i am dense sometimes!
okay there is a status going around and it sounds great when you first read it but if my friend  here is correct it is promoting universal healthcare which i am against! if i am wrong someone please correct me?? it's a plan that sounds great on the outside but there's some risky business going on we aren't being made aware of 
"ok heading to bed, did a little homework then tomorrow we are going to a festival at an <propmale> gallery in uptown <propfemale>! can't wait!!!"

"tonight a highschool student proceeded to tell my friend   \ my teacher is the 8th great granddaughter of <propmale> sawyer   how cool is that??\"" she was serious and meant it  what a cruel cruel teacher to play this trick on her students   especially those who fall for it!!!"""
for those of you who may fall for it too    tm sawyer is a fictional character!!! this was hilarious when i heard it! that's funny   i don't care who ya are!!!! okay it is late and i have gotten woke up too many times i am now looney but i had a great laugh!
"finally up   making pancakes! had a terrible nights sleep! it doesn't help that <propfirst> has been waking me up every 30 minutes for breakfast since about 5am! i got her a snack i was not fixing breakfast at 5am! she is on a kick where she says, \i'm starving to death mom!\"" lol!"""
okay lets see if we can get this right this time chris   getting ready to go to the <propfemale> literary festival for the second attempt to anyway lol! someone can't get their dates right!
well the <propfemale> literary fest was not what they advertised it to be but i had funn with <propfirst> anyhow and also learned a bit of a lesson on how i view what <propmale> should ve and that i should loosen my view a bit  i think this is first time i ever snubbed my nose at something   i kinda feel bad now  maybe they will get it together next year 
trying to stay up to see <propmale> get home! getting tired fast!! <propmale> is staying up too   adrian crashed long ago and will be up at 5am starving to death again lol!!

i am up way too early but got studying to do 
*breaking news* there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow    sad    so sad!! i have seen the end of the rainbow and it is heart breaking!!! hahaha cool huh?????

blah blah blah blah
adrians first day of dance! she is so excited! what a beautiful day out and i have too much homework and such to enjoy it!
<propfirst> says mommy embarrassed her because she smiled to much while she was in dance    i can't help i am proud!!!
tried going to bed earlier it did not work now trying again hahaha nite!
god has truly changed my life and done a work in my heart and everyday i try to grow closer to him   yet i have people who look at me and assume i never pray and seek god's will??!! i have had 3 people tonight mainly family tell me god's will for me   
think twice before you speak   does what you have to say discourage or encourage?? s many people just want to cry doom and gloom for everything you aspire or even the things god wants you to do!! god help me to seek you and your counsel not the counsel of the rest of the world  the world doesn't think before it speaks and it's counsel is often unwise 
if people got a dollar for every discouraging word that came from their mouth most of the world would be rich   i pray god will help even me be a better encourager!!
my mom just blesses me   sometimes she is mouthy and crazy on the outside but has a heart of gold just doesn't want anyone to know   when she has nothing she still manages to give  i came home to wrap her gifts for the missionaries which i thought would be few because her work has been really slow but was surprised and overwhelmed   i am blessed with a good momma and daddy 
"reading stories to kids and getting into bed a lil bit too late for them! then it's history of pottery test for me, and an analysis paper on a poem! fun!!"
love's <propmale> quixote in man of la mancha! there is such a wonderful picture of love in a portion of that story! reminds me of christ's love for us!
wants everyone to know she had no part in creating any questions on the friend faq quiz  there are some that are inappropriate! i made a complaint to facebook and thought i deleted the ones i was asked that were bad  please know i would never create such questions   they are computer generated!
one more time for the record friend faq questions are computer generated!! i have dleted this app and will no longer use it and reported it's inappropriate questions! i love ya'll and just want you to know i would never write those questions about my church family   i apologize if this has bothered anyone 
"i love people who assume all teenagers and young people think about nothing else but sex, drugs and alcohol   theres not s single good one out! ughh i know they are fed alot of bad things but not all young people are out looking for evil to get into!!! this irks me bad!"
<propfirst> has a kidney stone! ouch continue to pray for him i can't even imagine that pain!
"back to writing   wonder how it will turn out?? by the way anyone know that pottery is really difficult?? i was throwing <propmale> and tears tonight on that wheel! i will not give up! lol! busy day tomorrow, <propfirst> has field trip, both kids go to dentist then back to school! then home to finger paint with <propfirst> using slip! i am blessed with two wonderful kids!!"

okay   back to writing again   kids are in bed  what a wonderful day aside of being at the dentist forever lol  is really enjoying studying the book of <propfirst> so much to learn from this book and an inspiration to those who may feel they'll never win a battle   you can do anything with christ!!!

wishes <propmale> would hurry and get up so i can go to church with him and get some stuff ready for the fall festival! lol!
"they say money is the root of all evil?? i think they need to add gossip right in there! gossip, gossip it's poisoning our society and hurts ones we love and it's effects are like the ripples in a pond when you throw in the stone  it starts with one lil stone, one juicy piece of info and it spreads like wildfire  it's effects spread even further "
home from pottery class   spent the whole night making the clay   so time consuming   plus the bad dust you shouldnt breathe! but had a great day today got alot accomplished and now for the ever so wonderful environmental science homework!! i am glad i decided to finish college and thankful god has blessed me with a second <propmale>!
to bed now   still missed 3 questions on that yucky science class   i stay above the average grade but it would be nice to score a 100 or two in a science class! i did make a b in geology so i am proud of that since science is my enemy!!! lol!
time to clean!
"not much to say tonight excpet i hate shopping and i have done it for two days now!! well shopped around mostly not actually spent much but still ughh i am very unlike other women in that respect! give me a good book, magazine and a blanket under a tree in a park anyday over going to the mall or the next bargain store! lol!!"
"it's going to be one of those long nights   but god is with me   \when the waves are over you head they're under his feet!\"" (mckameys song)"""
"life takes you to une playful ected places   love brings you home  so many forget that the key to many problems is to close our mouths so not to say words you can never take back and just show unconditional, undying love for those who have went down the wrong roads and we can't understand and we just want them to turn back around  love them without the words   silent love speak multitudes "
is excited about the choir social   now what to cook?? god thank you for allowing us to be stable enough to cook for church functions   for a long time i wasn't able and i just love being able to   it's a joy! wish <propmale> would get home   we have got to get a decent affordable vacuum cleaner! this house hates vacuums they always tear u!! they don't last even a year i don't get it???

"been up since 5 smile 0   went with <propmale> to open church, then to walmart! time to start on that shoo fly pie and going to e playful eriment with bbq! one of my favorite foods and have yet to try and make it  we will see!!!"

oh my goodness!!! i just spent an hour and a half taking a 50 question test on theater!!! the hardest test all semester! i hate to see what our exam will look like! but on a happy note   i made a 96!!! the class average was 77 7 wooohooo for me lol! i can't help it i am proud lol!
time to tackle that storage building   ughh the heavy lifting! i have done it for two years alone i shall do it again!!!! lol!!! makes me sad to go there   i just need to empty it   it's full of life i can't have again   memories of it stored in cardboard boxes among the dust and cobwebs  but it must be done!!!
"talked to boss yesterday   not looking like we will be going back to work anytime soon  enjoying being able to take care of things though! cleaning out closets, storage building and just getting rid of old baggage all together   hoping to go see beauty and the beast friday!"
"taking mamaw <propfemale> to the store and starting dew detox today and sugar as well and force some healthier foods down  i'd bet if i was t get checked i am borderline diabetic    it's time to get it under control before i lose toes, feet, sight and all the other horrible stuff that can happen!!"
"oh and no one will want to bump into me the next few days lol quiting mt  dew is like an exorcist exorcising a demon out of me    hehe nahh not the bad, just kidding but i will feel like i have the flu thats for certain  ughhh"
so   the main pottery teacher was in our class tonight   and lets just say i learned more tonight than all semester! actually made several bowls   and got to glaze the stuff i already had fired! the most productive night i have had! oh and mom is finally creatig a facebook so add her and drive her crazy please!!!
is amazed that a guy could hear one line from the movie the wizard of oz and create a whole story around it   thus creating a bestselling novel   that turne into a <propfirst> award-winning broadway production called wicked that sadly i have not gotten to see yet!
my hats off to you mr  <propfirst> maguire lol!

getting ready   going to support <propfemale> spoon tonight at zanders! tomorrow going to see beauty and the beast! <propmale> and <propfirst>'s first musical!! told them they may as well learn to love theater now because there are many more years to come of it since their mother loves it and gets involved in it from time to time!

beauty and the beast tonight!!! can't wait!!!
can't wait only a few more hours!!! the kids first muscial!!! oh my i am a dork but hey i love theater with a passion!! i hope i actually get to enjoy it   because while watching it i also have to do a play analysis or or critique of it! i think i am more excited than my kids lol!!!
i can't spell aaghhh nah my fingers just get ahead of my brain   it's a musical lol not a muscial haha and i am going to college to earn a degree in english   hehehe oh well that's why i don't tell anyone    shhh

"beauty and the beast was absolutely wonderful! small intimate theater   not a bad seat in the house, live orchestra, amazing voices, just everything was fantastic! absolute best production i have seen since the phantom of the opera in toronto canada in the 90's! looking forward to the 2010 season and seeing <propfirst> poppins and wicked!!"
has totally misunderstood a text from my best friend in the world and now have hurt him and added to this terrible day for him  i also did not realize what today was to him either  i am really really sorry for speaking too soon and hurting them deeply 
is just exhausted today   time for a nap then maybe to surprise my friend and cheer them up!
"home   got homework to do but avoiding it momentarily  two papers to write   a critique about beauuty and the beast, and a dramatistic analysis of the poem i have to present next week! so much fun and still haven't picked a poem i like good enough!"
time for bed   church in the morning! been a nice day! except going to great grandpas and getting jalalenos   i am highly allergic to raw jalapenos and i picked them from the bucket to put in the bag and before i got across the street to home i could taste them in my throat and could feel it beginning to burn & i cant breathe if they are cooked they don't bother me   just the raw form   weird!
is too hot and cannot sleep!! wishing she would have at least heard from someone tonight to know they were alright    oh well   i guess 
up too early but maybe i wont be late for sunday school   getting much better at that! but when you and your kids are the last to get up and the other 3 ppl in the house wait til the last minute to shower and get ready   well you just have to wait lol not today!! haha i beat em all!
home for a big family dinner   yum!! then a nap! i hope anyway lol!
"home to do some homework   actually lots of homework lol! start memorizing the poems for thursday, and finish my papers and do my lovely environmental science homework!"

"time for some grocery shopping, then more homework  got to practice, practice, practice for my presentation at school thursday  please pray for me that god will use it to share the word with my classmates  i will be doing a poem from a lost person's point of view then the same poem with jesus christ's light shed into it by a christian woman  so just pray the devil doesn't rty to interfere with sharing god!"
home from school   glad to have a few pieces of pottery to look at lol! they arnt great but they are a start!! more studying to do ughh it never ends!!

time t start this day   that would be better used curled up in a blanket reading or doing nothing lol! since my dad interrupted my 2am homework time i have that to do to  lol! pray for <propmale> that he just has a cold only!
time for pottery class soon   ughh hate driving so far in the rain and the cold!!! i am excited though because i am finally making progress!!

another yucky day   i just have a case of the blahs   and so exhausted looking for job openings  praying very hard for another job  i think cabin fever is setting in 
just plain miserable today   hate not being on my own anymore!!! i can't wait to get out again   lord please make that sooner than later!!! please!!
"\lord help me somehow find the strength to try and make it one more day\"" \""and so hold on when there is nothing in you   except the will which says to them; hold on\"" the roughest day i have had in so long   actually a really long time  but god's still in control no matter how rough may be the day!!!"""

momma knows her stuff and her kids!!! no swine flu!!! thank you lord! <propmale> has had this happen before a cold he could not shake that drops into his lungs  he has a seasonal allergy problem that comes in winter and when he gets a cold it causes an inflammatory problem like a mild case of asthma  so he gets a lovely inhaler from now on to use when this happens again  so please pray for him! <propfirst> just has a cold 
not going to school tonight  staying with <propmale> and it was his first time using an inhaler and this medicine so wanted to make sure he has no reactions  he's not contagious either just want to make sure he does ok  so church in awhile!!

i have been blessed   god's so good to me   precious are his thoughts of you and me   no why i could count them there's not enough time   so i just thank him for being so kind   god has been good   so good i have been blessed!!!
"i believe god is really beginning to show me a path for my life, sometimes i don't understand why i have been through so much but i have learned so much   and have so much to share  there are so many things we have to deal with today and in our christian circles we'd rather consider them \taboo\"" than take the time to seek god and deal with the issue scripturally and with a loving heart  so many girls need help   """

"so i am not anti-war   some wars have to be fought but i forget   what is this war about?? if it isn't already it seems to me before its over we will have a religious war  i try not to be predudice, nor do i want my freedom of religion taken away   but there has to be a line drawn when your religion tells you to kill innocent people   particularly americans "
it's really sad because not all of this faith believe so radically but unfortunately as it tends to happen will be thrown in with the radicals either way   reminiscient of the witch hunts??? it's going to be the world against one religion   one faith   if they don't take over before we get the nerve to stand up for what we believe  how many more lives will be lost as this religion grows more rapidly everyday??
pray for us as we head to west virginia   we won't get into the difficult part of the mountain till after dark   so hopefully we will find our way  if i remember right there is a point where you have to stop and get gas because after that station it's 90 minutes deeper into the mountains 
"just got home from wv   had a wonderful time with <propfemale>  there is so much that still needs to be done and so many needs to be met  she is definately in need of some womens clothing, especially larger sizes  some ladies came to her for clothes for a funeral but didn't have any  pray that god will really bless the ministry she is starting "

"this rain makes me want to sleep, sleep, sleep "
finally found a monologue from <propfirst> wildes play <propfemale>  the story   although very much dramatized   of herod's stepdaughter who dance for him and then she requested the head of <propfirst> the baptist on a silver charger  it's a little morbid but i like the potential reaction i might get!!

if you are blessed with marriage   cherish every moment   the good and the bad  those annoying things your spouse does that drives you crazy   imagine life without them   you'll miss even the annoying things i assure you  love each other no matter what and never ever let divorce be an option   it deeply destroys your soul

well dentist got more than a tooth today   part of my bone   yay for me! so i had an e playful osed sinus cavity   no fun but now i'm stitched up and something was put in the missing bones place  but no blowing my nose or anything for a week and lots of pain to come   and daily visits to the dentist  anyone want to trade mornings??
does not like being banished to the upstairs and told over and over to rest when you cant sad  sitting or laying around is not my thing
"you know it's bad when the dentist tells you the next day   \when i saw how much bone came out with that tooth   it made me sick!!\""  i saw the shock in his eyes   not a good feeling! you know what though? being able to smile and chew and have everything fixed makes it so worth it! when the pain is gone there will be no regrets   i hope anyway lol """
mornings are the worst   i wake up and feel as if i have taken punches in the face and mouth   please pray this heals quickly and the pain eases
time to finish the last assignments for the semester!!!
finally temporarily numb to pain  no sleep last night   constant pain   the real kicker?? i just took the last pain pill i had  i am not one to even take medicine unless i have to and this is one time i am about to call the dentist for a refill!! but i don't want to call and ask!
needing a miracle this morning   praying and trusting god to provide   but it's not easy    nothing else i can do   
god is always in time   on time  every time!!! i stand amazed i tell you that!!! very thankful and truly amazed! thanks for the prayers!
an une playful ected blessing today on top of the morning blessings! thanks to a dear customer i have waited on for many years   god really knows our need and i wish i could just remember that when it gets rough! sadly i get down and dont always put enough faith and trust in god!
finally finished with school!!!! yay!!!! well for 3 weeks at least!
made an a in english and  b in enviro science so far   waiting on the rest of grades!! i am most excited that i made a 96 on my research paper!!! i have been checking for that grade religiously lol!!!
im not into sci-fi type stuff but avatar is actually a really good movie  didnt know it was done by <propfirst> <propfirst> whose last movie was titanic! hasn't done anything since   probably didnt have to! won't have to for another five years either! lol!
first night that i am not up til 2am or later doing homework!! instead i am up doing nothing! lol actually   i'm trying to get things done at the restaurant 
it's unbelievable how you can bust your tail   know what you are doing and do it right and all someone can do is look at you in front of everyone and say how they are annoyed because they didnt think the job got done good enough   a job they know nothing about  words and actions hurt and you must watch what you say because sometimes you do damage you can't repair 
"on the way to get more antibiotics   can't get what the dentist wanted me to get because of cost without insurance   getting a bad sinus infection thanks to my lovely \complications\""  ughh just want to feel normal again!! lol well i never was normal but you get the point!"""
free desserts for moms @ uptown tonight!!!!!! avoid the sunday crowds and eat at uptown family restaurant tonight!!!
happy mother's day to all mother's!!!
had a good day   had fun at <propfemale> and <propfirst>'s having a cookout! they are like family been fellowshipping together my whole life! did some picking and grinning too  time for bed can't wait to see what the dentist is going to say tomorrow   can't be good at the moment 
today is a new day   the long miserable weekend is behind me!!! glad its monday!!! really praying for the business we desperately need things to pick up 
well i hate allergy meds   don't take them   now i temporarily have to  so i took my first maximum strength benedryl and my legs feel like jello and i have a sinking feeling i will be out like a light not long after typing this  this stuff makes me feel loopy or something weird like that     
lord willing my name may finally come off the mortgage!!! amen   praise the lord!!!! better credit finally here i come lol!
you know   the possibility of being free from a mortgage is wonderful   but turning over what once was your home   and giving it up   is a pill to big to swallow  that last thread that held our names together will finally be broken    is freedom truly always what its cracked up to be?
it is so nice to come home and be able to watch movies again   2 more weeks to enjoy!!!
2 a's 2 b's   i'll take it!!!!!
just got a phone call to let me know i have been accepted to lenoir rhyne!!!! i have waited a long time for this and am so thankful! last two years of school here i come!!!
getting off of here    lightning is not my friend    the reason i do not <propfemale> umbrellas anymore!!! long day  very tired!!!!
heading to mayfest to pass out menus and coupons!!
went to mayfest and i was quickly reminded of why i hate sales and marketing    i wasn't technically selling anything but i was   my business   not for me! felt so uncomfortable!! i will have to have someone do this for me!! i can serve people until the cows come home   i can show people how to do something but ask me to sell and i clam up and am useless! crazy huh?
"had a good steady day!! very blessed and truly thankful! sometimes the hard stuff blinds me to the goodness god is doing in my life! for some reason he still loves me! many friends, family, guys    whoever may give up on me and think i am a failure but god sees me different  hes sees enough in me to have brought me this far   providing my every need and loving me even when i didnt love myself "
really enjoying the start of our revival!!! having church with no power def made the night interesting!!
i have never in my life   had to put up with such absurdity as i do with wachovia!!! such nice employees but the company who tells them how things should be done is so behind the times and absolutely rotten! i never ever had problems with peoples bank ever! the devil needs to quit getting in to everything and get out of our way!! we do business in the name of the lord and he will be our strength!!
is so excited about starting at l-r!! i can finally see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel   although i am sure very soon it will be clouded by the stacks of books i use for research for the billion papers i will be required to write in the next two years! i am excited either way!!!
time to kick <propfirst>' butt in some basketball!!!!
praying god really turns things around or it may be time to throw in the towel   
psalm 46    god is my refuge      
heading to asheville   some quiet time alone with the lord in the car!
only a few more weeks until school begins again! at least i have the summer before the english overload begins  smile  i am so excited though   i love it! it has been a long hard road and i am almost there!
if anyone knows someone with a reasonably priced car to sell please let me know!

time for awanna awards and getting to hear our wonderful youth group sing for the first time in years!!!! i cant wait to hear them!
god is working   don't know what the outcome will be but he definitely has a plan!
lovin the truck   always wanted one but never ever believed id have one  god is good!! god is working and we are still just waiting to see what he is going to do!
well the end of the month is almost here    god will either allow us the to stay or it will be time to close this chapter   either way god has been good and really blessed us and we have loved every minute of this adventure! grateful to have the opportunity in this economy to at least try 
was told today for a second time prayer will not save a business   they left and not even an hour later a prayer answered   my god is amazing and words couldnt tell you the miracles he has worked in our lives this last two weeks! we are blessed with amazing friends who pray with us and we will keep praying  thanks everyone who has supported our business very much!
today is a new day   it is in gods hands   he is in control of it all! this business belongs to him not me and he will do with it what he sees fit to do 
i'm amazed

summer school will not get me down   it will not defeat me!!! aghh!!!
why do people with more education feel the need to make others around them feel stupid? there has always been a negative voice in my life coming from somewhere i have learned to live with it but it will not change my course   
i want to go somwhere with my kids for a few days just us to have fun   but its so darn e playful ensive!! i can take a road trip cheaper but that would not interest my children  hmmm more looking online i guess or i could just call up my personal travel agent lol   tammy calling tammy   help!! lol
busy weekend ahead! <propmale> played a great game yesterday evening and got another game tonight and in the am!
hot
"this week has by far been the most stressful i have ever had!! with that said i want to thank god for having things worth stressing over   it means i have a family i love,  job to do, bills to pay wich means i am blessed with what i need, an education to achieve and this week   precious little ones to teach  which is challenging but god is molding me and making me for something   i am blessed and god has been good!"
just a note my stressful week has nothing to do with bible school lol i have loved getting to teach   it has been an unusually busy week at work that is causing my stress and of course school and registering for 19 credit hours at l-r  going to be a busy year! reality hits when the directors of the education program tell you   you start preparing for graduation now   but it seems so far away
wheew so tired    busy week at work   praise the lord!!! knee deep in homework   already worrying about the fall   praying to squeeze in some kind of vacation   or just me and my kids time! just truly blessed to be doing things i love   it will all be worth it one day!!!
"just found out that all my most important classes transferred to lr with no problem   after this summer i have about 80 hours to go before i can graduate!! played around outside and was batting for about 20-30 minutes with <propmale>, <propfirst> and <propfirst> and wore the skin right off my thumb! even lil <propfirst> can hit the ball! i was impressed cuz she is not athletic! she is artistic lol! been a great day & had a great service!"
"let me make a correction about my previous post i only posted what i knew and was told by family as calls came in last night  never meant any disrespect at all just wanted our church family to pray! no \rumors\"" were intended  i love my family even when i dont see them all the time and some i don't know well  pray the family will find out what has really happened and get some peace  sorry to those i may have offended """

me and my mouth   always going to get me in trouble   i thought i had overcome this problem lol  some things are better off left unsaid i guess  but when you are trying to overcome being a liar like i was for so long   you become brutally honest   it doesn't always benefit me i can tell you that  oh well

"school is going to murder me   wolosky   merwin  book after book, chapter after chapter   article after article!!! even math i have to read!!! i do not know what i was thinking wow is all i can say   very, very, difficult semester    "
well interesting but i got asked if i gave up a daughter 23 years ago   slightly offended until i realized my profile is very private now and there is no photo posted of me so how would they have known   right?
hours of reading    hours of work   i'm exhausted   overwhelmed   not handling this change well   long classes and trying so hard to focus   just not happening as well as i'd like  in religion i did however learn that you never turn your back on a bull and never enter a cow pasture without a pitch fork!!  smile 
today was such a busy day and half my work isn't even done       exhausted    i need a room filled with silence    so my head can quit spinning   and my heart can slow down   and so my mind could just be at rest   for just a moment   
"off to work and running behind   but it's labor day weekend and everyone is outta town so i am e playful ecting a long, slow   day   yuck!"
"just got home from asheville   first time there   and by far the most interesting evening <propfirst> and i have ever had  took a guy there so he did not have to pay over $100 for a shuttle, ended up asking us to <propfemale> out, bought us dinner and we had a great time  turns out he is an editor, and a former editor of the washington post and lives in washington d c  felt we'd known him forever lol "
"ha  <propfirst> told me that the guy we took to asheville made a comment that i should not be so trusting and he should really look out for me   because not everyone will turn out to be nice   he clearly had no clue the amount of weaponry that surrounded him in my truck   i and <propfirst> both armed and had him plant \things\"" in my truck before trip took place   this girl aint stupid!!! ha!"""
i'm crazy what can i say   note to self   never stretch yourself this thin again   makes me want to take up smoking   i know  i know   trust me i won't   just an urge   just can't seem to get into this new school schedule and atmosphere   the most challenged i have been in forever and makes me want to say  forggett aboout it!!!!
who doesn't love the company of free-spirited highly intelligent people?? our trip was the most interesting i have ever had   still intrigued by it   a writer editor who is pretty successful  in my vehicle and wanted to keep our company for awhile rather than just drop him off  i love meeting new people  i needed a night out of the ordinary   very refreshing  silly but one has to wonder if it was a <propmale> encounter?
"enjoying a day off  going to have breakfast this morning with chris  something we never get to do   then it's a crash cleaning day   hoping to surprise mom and dad at least a lil   hopefully lol  now lets go get some livermush, eggs, grits, and biscuits!"
walmart   lots of laundry to do   need lots of detergent!!!
i just don't get it   why is it so much to ask for genuine compassion?? do people really care about other people anymore?? or does everyone pretend??
exhausted    brain dead    thats all i can muster    
finally   went to school and felt in sync with it all   got a lil organized and whala   much better    still so much to do   read   write   plan    no rest for me lol!

having to write a paper on faith and religion   basically just sharing my views for the instructor   a good assignment!!
solitude                           
"500 word paper on a story in math class of all places, paper on my faith and such, a response paper to the syntax and metaphors used in one of wyatts poems   all before the morning!!! yikes and i am so   so   tired!"
it seems lately i am always needing a miracle   and i am unworthy to receive anything but god has always come through just in time   my redeemer is faithful and true   everything he has said he will do   every morning his mercies are new     my redeemer is faithful and true!!!
"can already tell the 3rd grade is going to be rough   my son who is great at math is getting really frustrated and so am i with this \new\"" math program  he says she rushes through it so fast he can't keep up     if i had time i would seriously homeschool   i have wanted to for years but just can't do it yet    """

made our own version of hot pockets   a cheeseball and <propfirst> had her naked shrimp shes been begging for awhile now lol   loving the extra time with my kids   even when my son decides to randomly sing opera and <propfirst> feels the need to yell   they must be the loudest kids ever!!! but i wouldn't trade them for the world smile 
hard lesson number one:   don't want to be a quitter?? don't share your hopes and dreams with anyone   tell god about them (and of course you need to see that they line up with what god wants for your life) or write them down   if you share them with others   you will be stomping on them and spitting on them before the day is over 
catawba county out again on thursday!!! are you kidding me sad 
pray request:we really love our new place and it has a lot of potential but it has come with such a mess that we just don't know we will be able to fix it  we have grown business in what little time we have been there but with two holidays robbing us of what little profit we would have made and now the snow   i am considering throwing in the towel  i just don't want to make the wrong choice sad  pray for us please 
hard lesson #2: learn to be organized at a young age or when you decide to start your own business and it's tax time   you will really hate yourself! i should have <propfirst> draw a cartoon of me and my mountain of invoices and receipts and maybe   just maybe later i will laugh about this   but right now i will be drowning in my mess of business   need me? throw out a life preserver   please;-p
no school again   sigh   my daughter misses her school too much please let her go back playful 
i am not sure why i insist on laying on my left side   propped up on my left elbow   after awhile i try to move and it's followed by excruciating pain   i always forget and do it again   one day i am going to have to let some crazy doctor put those bones in the right place   but not yet   it's still tolerable over someone cracking my bones!!
decision day    
"god answered two prayers for me today and the reactions i often get from people when i share how awesome he has been    is a \well   \"" or \""ah   \"" like they are saying \""oh well   you just told me something really cool god did but who really cares??\"" well he knows   that i know   i am his and i am so very grateful   i don't near deserve all he has done for me this last several years   i have truly been blessed!!"""

"the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows  it is a very mean and nasty place it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it  you, me or nobody is going to hit as hard as life  but it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward  that's how winning is done! --<propmale> balboa\(thanks <propmale>!)"

"my ideals on relational love are pretty harsh   those types of feelings have disintegrated in my being   but it's amazing how the simple, kind, behind the scenes acts of another can make you realize you do still have a heart thats beating  maybe or maybe not for that particular person but it sparks something you thought you'd forgotten "
infobesity   overconsumption of social media   i e  facebook
today   is going to be a good day   
no children tonight so i get to watch what i want on t v!! as well as take up the whole bed smile  if only i had mint chocolate chip ice cream  this night   would be glorious   but i will settle for my one single box of girl scout cookies instead   
the first few pretty weekends=beautiful weather to play in laugh ead business=unhappy diner owner sad     on the other hand   god is good and i have survived a year self employed and only by god's grace and the loyalty of many special friends and customers!!! thank you all who have supported us so very much!!!

on top of stress for the day i learned our plays we wrote will be performed in front of other professors and anyone on campus who wants to attend and families and friends   it nearly killed me to have it read in front of classmates but in front of a bunch of other people??? not ready to be that public with any of my writing   puts me in such a vulnerable position i do not care to be in!!!
"i love to write   i can at the least <propfemale> a tune and love to sing, so why have i never tried writing a song??? hard times make for good song writing yes? lol just crossed my mind   still got to get someone to string up one of these guitars   time to find something to pass the time   guitar, music, and baseball with luke   maybe i will even help   "
the kids and i desperately need a break from everything!! i have been trying to save a little and i think when my spring break rolls around we will road trip   i think they are old enough to enjoy it and i do it on a cheap budget   praying anyway it would be a nice break from all the stress   we have not been on vacation just us ever   it will be a wonderful first as <propmale> reminded me    love the wisdom in children smile 
sadness always brings great change    and usually sappy writing   but it's writing at least   
went to see proof tonight now time for some <propmale> revision    
first day of <propfemale> <propfirst>    
"if you have someone you spend a lot of time with and they drive you up the wall   never say what you want them to, never do what you want them to,  and all you can think of is getting them out of your hair    you better love them to death while they are still around because once they are gone   you will not only be heartbroken but realize you lost more than a friend   but the other half of yourself    "
can't eat   can't sleep   can't stop crying    i have never ever been such a mess    words can't e playful ress the pain   i just want it to go away   
"mcwilliams: \the layers i have put around the pain of your going are thin  i walk softly through life,adding thickness each day a thought or a feeling of you cracks the surface a call from you shatters it all and i spend that night in death,and spin the first layer of life with the sunrise "
epic fail sad 
so lets go see if this supposed software upgrade fixes my phone   i sure hope so!
today was a really good day   tonight the stomach sickness has momentarily subsided   i hope for good! got to sit and talk with a good friend and <propfemale> out with some new ones tonight  through the pain and stress of this week i remember   i was made for so much more than this     
another day absence of sickness   yay!!! then at 6am someone made my day smile  nice that there are those who truly know how to show kindness and compassion   without many words at all

it's amazing how we try and try to change   try everything   and all it takes is one incident   one thing to tear down all those walls and change you forever   what felt like you wouldn't get changed for an eternity   changed overnight  now accepting the changed me will take some work but i finally feel like the me that i long forgotten   the me before being scarred by life's pain and trials  its a bit surreal

nothing worse than waking up late  getting to work and finding out your partner did the same    monday has come in with a roar   
we have worked really hard on math and reading comprehension and i think at this point i would be failing my child if i didn't put him back in school  i think he is better prepared now and has the confidence needed and it will solve any issues that may arise in the future when trying to re-enter him for 4th grade 
why must we as humans be so hurtful   it comes as easy as breathing   i need a vacation from hurt   it has been coming in all shapes and sizes and frankly i would like to kick it out of my life!!

wow 42 pages of paper work for the lawyer and thats not all of it   overwhelming   praying my visit goes well and god will guide him in showing me the wisest decision to make about this situation   so that what is best is done and nothing less   a little frightened at the moment sad

in need of a miracle   what would be great is to find a buyer for the house that bears my name and my ex husbands  it is in maiden  i know there is literally no market for homes right now   but god has no market! at this moment until full decisions and preparations are made we are looking to friends and family to see if there is anyone out there who may be looking for a new home 
"poor kid came home with a huge load of math worksheets they wanted him to do   we literally just got done sad  too late for this! one plus though   when i picked him up from school today, for the first time literally ever he said  \school was great mom!\"" never heard him say that before even as a small child he disliked school   too much time with mom made him appreciate his friends and teachers lol!"""
"i just have to be all mushy just for a moment   i must say that i have the greatest boyfriend in the world   who in my absence helps me with my children when he doesn't have to, makes sure they get their homework done and gets them to church   he is just simply awesome, what more could you ask for? i love you <propfirst> cone!! you have stood with me when no one else would   you are my best friend "
"who am i?     i am a flower quickly fading   here today and gone tomorrow   a wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind, still you hear me when i'm calling, lord you catch me when i'm falling, you told me who i am    i am yours    "

getting home at midnight from one job and going in to the other at 5am is for the birds   i am so exhausted   
"i am simply past the point of being tired anymore   may as well make myself academically productive tonight    one more month of this two job deal that steals me from family, church and school work   lord willing one more month    "
blah blah    
we are trying to decide what to do for dinner    then i must get to this paper i keep avoiding seeing as how i always choose something ridiculous or too difficult   me and my stupid note card got me into this mess! i guess it's better than writing on lysistrata which i was not particularly fond of at all!! perversion   not my thing!
"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear  while you humiliate, offend, and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is  while you hurt her, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away  while you make her cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her         post this on your wall if you are against domestic violence & mental abuse "
"spring cleaning some more, going through old boxes and all you can do is cry    old pictures, a notebook full of perfectly handwritten recipes from mamaw <propfemale> addressed to me, lots of old memories   but life has new memories yet to bring that will somehow soften the blow of the old     smile "
just totally found a huge stash of premier designs jewelry i thought i had gotten rid of!!! sweet!! it's amazing what you find in my messes!
"should school be put on hold to save my business? it has great potential but i can't find that potential and work both jobs, and go to school    really needing to make a decision   something has to wait   i just can't do both anymore and keep my sanity   it's too overwhelming for one person   and no   i am not as strong as you may have thought   quite the opposite   "
well when hacking and choking won't allow you to sleep   at least more cleaning gets done!!! i have much to go but i am beginning to feel a sense of accomplishment    a nice feeling because this task has been a burden for years  i have just pushed the mess around not wanting to deal   but i am dealing pretty good now smile  can't keep your life in boxes forever!
<propfemale>   
it will all be fine    breaking the news is the hardest part   
i am hoping that when all is said and done    i will feel like a 300lb weight has been lifted    i may just be a flat out different person minus the huge amount of stress of the last year or so! hoping i will look back and be happy about this decision   i have already planned that this summer is devoted to my children   one job   no school   just summer fun smile 
church time smile 
praying that everyone finds a job very soon sad 
"praying for <propfirst> and <propfirst> as they look for a new job today   god wanted us to close this door so i have to believe he is waiting to open another for everyone  thankful i have a part time job on the side  i had been planning to quit soon, glad i did not do it yet and they were all fussing at me for leaving again anyway so now i guess they can't get rid of me lol! can't stop having faith now   "

we need positive health reform but my goodness more than that   educational reform!!! it's time    long overdue   
had a poetry reading to attend and promised to be out tonight with our group spreading poetry via sidewalk chalk but when your kids cry for you not to leave and for once it's actually not necessary for you to go it's just something you wanted to do   you can't help but give in   so instead we had dinner out together and just took our time and laughed and talked   now bedtime story   king <propfirst> and the round table smile 
is praying about a job   hoping something with consistent income   or i will just stay where i am just hate missing church!

"so good to see our friends and was <propfirst>'s first time going to their house so <propfirst> had to give him his tour of toys lol!! hot rods, collector cars, his radio room, pottery all sorts of awesome stuff   which is why he loves his job running an antique store! if you have never been you should go to downtown conover and visit <propfirst> and <propfemale> at sentimental journeys  they are truly a blessing to us and we love them smile "
i wish my mind would just stop sometimes   it's always in high gear   if i had a $1 for every idea i have had i would be filthy <propmale>! someone stop me please?? my gypsy mentality is so going to be the death of me sad  i always seem to have a plan for everything  now i need a plan that tells me how to make my plans work for once!
"having very sharp pains in my lower left side  kind of scary being i never went back to make sure there were no more cancer cells when i should have two years ago but with no insurance you just don't go  hopefully they will go away soon and nothing is wrong, def need to be checked again  one of those things one doesn't want to know "

wonderful service at church this morning!! time to get kids to their fathers and visit a few friends  hopefully my hip will begin to work again it decided to stop functioning properly which has never happened this pain is miserable but i will smile anyway!!
well my age is showing   i have a bum hip and all i did was stand up after sunday school! i have never been this constrained and it's making me a bit crazy and claustrophobic (i know i am weird)! it is very painful and kept me from my plans to be outdoors all day playing basketball or tennis with my boyfriend as i had wanted sad  at least i am getting plenty of rest smile 
"me with my bum leg cooked new york strip, buttered noodles, and corn on the cob and the last few bites of hershey's chocolate pie smile  this has been a very non traditional easter afternoon but a good one none the less smile "
well i can't get around so i may as well get ahead on homework and get some studying in  was hoping this would be gone by now but prescription pain meds are not even touching it   praying it heals quickly before i go bonkers!
i am having serious difficulty walking and the pain has now decided to take over my other hip sad 
time to look something up worth watching and i miss my kids sad 
feeling a great deal better this morning smile  we will see if that continues after the long walk from my car to classes!
"i am amazed that 600 teachers will lose their jobs yet the line of people i get behind when i want to simply pay for gas but must wait 20 minutes while people pick lottery tickets, scratch them off and play again seems to grow every day   so why is there no meny for teachers?? oh and i have a copy saved to my desk top of where each portion of the money is supposed to go, also where money supposedly went!"
"bbq chicken, <propmale> cheese, baked beans, homemade mashed taters (for the potato salad haters) and potato salad smile  i am proud of my gamer son he has actually played outside most of the day! <propfirst> loves the outdoors she is the one who will bring in frogs and lizards if she ever caught one lol!"

on my way to <propfemale> as much as i love music the quiet time will be much appreciated   time alone is nice!
it's going to be an all nighter but thats alright i have gotten enough rest to handle it smile 
my daughter just spent 10 minutes trying to e playful lain to me how you can accidentally do something on purpose   
there are things that make me love being an english <propmale> but when you take teaching out of the equation well leaves me to wonder so i have pondered and prayed about which direction to go with school and due to my interests my passions and some jobs i would like to hold after school i have decided to get a communications degree in public relations

i have limited myself to one glass of dew a day   ate zero yummy rolls from boxcar on my shift   upped my calcium intake and even water (yuck)  not because i want to be oh so healthy necessarily but because i am too poor to buy new clothes so i must continue to fit into what i have   which has not been going well wink 
question: okay so he is dead   so do you believe they truly just found him and killed him? or have they known where he was and killed him coincidentally in time to gain the public's interest for the upcoming presidential election? what is my fb friends public opinion at this point?

"osama and hitlers death was both confirmed may 1st  osama 2011 and hitler 1945\(posted by my sister or brother in law)"
