"as followers of christ, we have more power than we realize  don't think too much, or in other words, don't psyche yourself out with rules and requirements  step into the situation because you have what it takes; it will come to you when you need it  and remember   the holy spirit is within you giving you what you need, when you need it  doubt is simply a luxury we can't afford any more "
"women's ass size study    there is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses    the results were pretty interesting  30% of women think their ass is too fat  10% of women think their ass is too skinny  the remaining 60% say they don't care, they love him, he's a good man and they wouldn't trade him for the world    i know you're laughing!! feel free to repost this if you love your ass! lol"
"god delights in us just as we are  you are pleasing to god already  or to put it another way: god likes you  this may be hard to believe but it is true  you bring pleasure to god right now as you read this \so take it  bask in it  yes, right now, without lifting a finger, god is pleased with you  he made you for this  he made you and he delights in you  this is where we start "

     off to work

"but the truth remains: no matter how bad someone else might seem to me, i am worse \and then i bring all this to the table and find out about god's mercy      "
"so tired    been out of bed for an hour and my eyes are still burnng, did not sleep well last night at all!\oh well, back to work    maybe i can slip out early today     ?  wink "
