"back to work today after a couple weeks off  ug! i suppose i should be grateful that no one, it seems, can get stuff done without me around  maybe that equates to job security "
it's our anniversary today  31 years of married bliss!
decided to tone our anniversary celebration down and only went out to eat last night at the sizzler to celebrate  it made us both sick!

i'm going fishing to the owyhee river tomorrow afternoon  any takers to go with me?
<propfemale> left for south <propfemale> this morning  will be gone until friday  who would have guessed that a part time job would turn into this 
after 12 hours and 3 flight changes <propfemale> finally made it  storms caused a delay in landing at <propfemale> beach and they had to fly out over the atlantic in turbulent weather  <propfemale> felt like kissing the ground when they finally landed 
having a reallly nice snow blizzard right now  it would be pretty if it wasn't may!
"just got in big trouble with <propfemale> and <propfemale> for dumping out the stinkiest sensi wax made! they say it's exotic, i say it's notious "
"worked in mccall with <propfemale> helping me on saturday, had to go back on monday, back on tuesday, and again this coming friday  that road is getting mighty boring!"

"i've been working in mccall the last 2 days  i've been rained on, snowed on, hailed on and blown to bits!"
i'm starting to run out of places to pile snow!
