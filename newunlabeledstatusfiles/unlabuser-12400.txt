"if we crawl till we can walk again then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump then we'll fly until there is no end so lets crawl, crawl, crawl back to love back to love"
relationships are too hard to start and end  sad  one of the reasons is because no1 asks you out until you tell them you like them -_-

"trying to break a fall by putting your hand out in front of you seems almost instinctive  but the force of the fall could travel up the lower forearm bones and dislocate the elbow  it also could break the smaller bone (radius) in the forearm  a break can occur near the elbow at the radial \head \""  that wat happened 2 me  sad """
arm hurts but is getting better  going to orthopedics nxt week wednesday
omg i need a vacation from school!! can't w8 till spring break!!!

i'm now relizing it really is true that you don't know what you've got until it's gone and how lies can ruin something that you wanted all your life and how 1 mistake can destroy something you don't want to let go  -_-
