"â€œit hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel â€�"
"hope is the most exciting thing in life and if you honestly believe that love is out there, it will come  and even if it doesn't come straight away there is still that <propmale> all through your life that it will â€�"
"\may the love hidden deep inside your heart find the love waiting in your dreams  may the laughter that you find in your tomorrow wipe away the pain you find in your yesterdays â€�"""
"â€œeven though we've changed and we're all finding our own place in the world, we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face, we'll come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us, nothing will ever change so much to the point where we're not all still friends â€�"
"when things are bad, we take comfort in the thought that they could always be worse  and when they are, we find hope in the thought that things are so bad they have to get better â€�"

â€œit's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance  it is the dream afraid of waking that never takes the <propmale>  it is the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give  and the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live â€�
"â€œanyone can give up, it's the easiest thing in the world to do  but to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that's true strength â€�"
we got snow and i am so happy i woke up this morning and there was snow on the ground!!!!
â€œthe very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for  and the most you can do is live inside that hope â€�
"â€œlord, make me an instrument of your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy â€�"
