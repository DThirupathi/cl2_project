ughhhh i'm so frustrated
lmao ppl are too funny
"we living in a world that's dirty and so shife\trying to figure out this the game that's called life\these days are cold and got me searching for my soul\like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold\i'm looking out my window for some, sunshine"
"i need you to rescue me from my destiny\iâ€™m trying to live right and give you whateverâ€™s left of me\cause you know life is what we make it and a\<propmale> is like a picture, itâ€™d be nice if you just take it"
my new couch is beautiful
whats done in the dark always comes to light please remember this ladies were not  the damn fools you may feel like we are
truth: i always fall for your type
this is my moment of clarity *deep breath in* at this moment i just feel so alive
"see you dont ever have to worry about me \as long as you keep it real \whatevers on your mind \speak on how you feel \stay truthful to me \and never lie to me \and dont ever keep no secrets \no matter whatever"
wish i could make everything right again
ugh my stomach is in knots   my mind heart is consumed with anger wish this feeling would pass
- trust   the trait that is hardest to buid but easiest to destroy!!  
its not chipped were not cracked were shattered no super glue can fix this ish when i break   i break #getupoutmyfacegirl
"- sometimes in order to be happy, you have to get hurt   learn from your mistakes and dont make them again, because then its no longer a mistake its a choice"
tired of the ratchetness   next fool that hurts me or my fam gonna get the business (i got hands like a man and 20 other women just like me(we ready!))
"i swear i always fall for your type, for your type\tell me why i always fall for your type, for your type\i just can't e playful lain this shyt at all why do i belive in people like you?"
imma hold you down till the day i die
"thanking the good lord for blessing me with another day and with clarity, understanding and peace god is good!!"
so im making lunch and <propfirst> walks in the kitchen with his always hungry tail and is just observing what im doing then he spins out like a ballerina singing lady in pink ummm its official this kid belongs with me he had me laughing so hard
so done with it
why am i watching these stupid cartoons?!? #ughspringbreak
i want to trust again    whoowh this is gonna be a long bumpy road
so i started cooking with one idea and went a whole different direction   gumbo it is! (chopped and screwed of course)
"now even tho i try to play it off i'm thinking about you all day long\got me fiening for her love can't lie\man you should see how she got me \and i couldn't leave her if i wanted to \cause i can't breathe when you talk to me\i can't breathe when you're touching me\i suffocate when you're away from me\so much love you take from me\i'm going outta my mind"
i hate the new mcdonalds commercial   that is all
wishing my wife <propfemale> mayfield was already home #missinher
wishing these negative thoughts would move around  guess this is part of that long bumpy road  annoyed 
trust is so easily broken   and sooooo very hard to earn back    
shontelle-impossible #that is all
it kills me-melanie <propfemale> #that is all
all that bullshit's for the birds   that is all
can't seem to find the motivation to get out of the bed today   ughhh my head hurts
"and who do you think you are\running 'round leaving scars\collecting your jar of hearts\and tearing love apart\you're gonna catch a cold\from the ice inside your soul"
rawwwwrrrrr means i love you in dinosaur  smile 
makin my baby some enchiladas for dinner
irritated and pissed off for no apparent reason ughh
woke up today feeling much better   thanking the lord for blessing me with another   beautiful one
"cant wait for summer! i miss those summer rains, the smell of chlorine and barbq kids with snow cone stained faces and such    come on summer!!"

fell asleep last night with the most beautiful girl in the world   woke up to her poking me asking for some cereal its a benedryl type of day nighty night
ugh i feel horrible today   prayin for the pain to stop
making shrimp lemon pepper pasta for dinner
mmmmmm the shrimp lemon pepper pasta turned out wonderful hope everyone enjoys it i spent a whole hour on it
"damn you the shyt\and iâ€™ll rip my heart out and hand you the shyt\and i dont really know how to handle this shyt\but tonight its moonlight and candles and shyt\with you baby with youuuu and only you"
the worst thing about being lied to is knowing that you weren't worth the truth
sometimes we e playful ect more from others because we are willing to do that much for them
"love is a decision, and itâ€™s a decision of how weâ€™ll treat other people "
so much on my mind   praying for peace of mind and joy
my baby got an a on her test today and she had a perfect week at school #godanswersprayers
pulling weeds at my moms   ooooh my hands hurt
watching speed racer with the wife and kid #gospeedracer
"no matter what the people say i'm gonna love u anyway  u r my life, i can't let u go  even if we fuss or fight, try until we get it right  u r my life, i can't let u go  even if we disagree u can put it all on me  u r my life, i can't let u go     there's no safer place then 2 b in love n here i will stand     <propfemale> mayfield"
"i had no choice but to hear you \you stated your case time and again \i thought about it \you treat me like i'm a <propfemale> \i'm not used to liking that \you ask how my day was \you've already won me over in spite of me \don't be alarmed if i fall head over feet \and don't be surprised if i love you for all that you are \i couldn't help it \it's all your fault"
"if i fall along the way \pick me up and dust me off \and if i get too tired to make it \be my breath so i can walk \if i need some other love \give me more than i can stand \and when my smile gets old and faded \wait around i'll smile again \shouldn't be so complicated \just hold me and then \just hold me again \can you help me i'm bent \i'm so scared that i'll never \get put back together"
pray for my baby shes sick  sad 
maybe i could have handled that better   
another fun filled day of washing and folding clothes  annoyed oh boy
but i'm the only one who will walk across the fire for you i'm the only one who'll drown in my <propfemale> for you it's only fear that makes you run the demons that you're hiding from when all your promises are gone i'm the only one
"you must be willing to give total unconditional love to everyone, under all circumstances  that means being willing to be totally responsible for what you do and how you do it"
"when we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace"
"all of us have a thousand wishes  to be thinner, to be bigger, have more money, have a cool car, a day off,to date the person of your dreams  a cancer patient only has one wish, to kick cancer's butt  i know that 97% of you won't post this as your status, but my friends will be the 3% that do  in honor of someone who died, or is fighting cancer, or even had cancer, post this for at least one hour"
