<propmale> ware is my hero right now putting mcnabb on his back

what's new?
"so i was thinking about time just now, because i don't want to get up for my 8 o'clock class tomorrow, and i was wondering; what if time concepts were different?  like what if a day didn't exist only hours, but hours were equal to what a day is now and there is no unit to separate an hour into smaller segments and we still used the hour for our main time frame "
"for example, my 8 o'clock class is 1 hour and 15 minutes, so instead of it being what our concept of time defines an hour as, lets think of it as the concept e playful lained earlier   1 hr and 15 minutes equals 1 25 hours so it would be equivalent to 1 25 days our concept or 30 hours   now that is a long class "
lets go hogs!!! 7-0 already!!!
come on hogs!! we need touchdowns against bama!
