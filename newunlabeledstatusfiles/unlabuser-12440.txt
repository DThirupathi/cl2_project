we should keep private matters private! this is a public space and if you don't want to hear what someone has to  say then keep your private business where it belongs 
it has been a very long day! had a job interview this morning then went to the hospital to sit with my sister while my brother-in-law had heart bypass surgery  what a day!!!!
had a wonderful time dancing the night away! better get to bed have to be up early for church 
there is nothing like sitting in the porch swing with the cool morning breeze blowing on you and listening to nature all around you!
had a wonderful weekend!!! the single adult conference was my first and it was great! made new friends and gained new insight on many aspects of my life  i loved being with singles like me!!!
