as i look at the <propfemale> and listen to some music i'm remind of a world were i once resided where i traveled with some friends and fought to save the world it seems i get a second <propmale> to revisit the place i used to love
i'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram on a silver black phantom bike when the metal is hot and the engine is hungry and we're all about to see the light nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole everything is stunted and lost and nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls and nothing's ever worth the cost
when i look at the night sky i often wonder if i shall ever have anyone to share it with
                               ! ! ! ! !
