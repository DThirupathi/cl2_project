"$999,999 from being <propmale> but now i'm all for it   "
die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villian
"i was the baby boy i could do no wrong   my, how time has caught up with me "
<propmale> <propmale> stole my life
maybe i just need to be more simple minded   not see things the way how i see them but how everyone else does   my greatest gift are my thoughts but i've fail to use them
back against the wall   rubbing elbows with da scumbags   i gotta see my way through it all
how could you judge me unless you was me   i was brought up in pain   ruined by the ghetto that you ruined 
pockets full of hope   with nothing to believe in 
"i've made mistakes, i've lost my way   maybe cause i've never been shown the way  blinded by the sights attracted to the bright lights wanna live that fast life   i'm ready"
losing the fight but got no towel to throw-in   
"mama raised me    pop left me    lord help me forgive him, i know i got some issues  you know how the story begins, but how does it end?"
born to dictate   neva follow orders   make my own way 
everything i'm not   makes me everything i am  
bet against me   you'll lose your tie and shirt   plus everything you worth 
built ford tough   but move like a enzo   
gifted like christmas day   
we can't run from who we are

"came from the dirt, but trying to escape without any stains on my shirt   "
if life's a bitch do we cheat on her with death   
watching <propmale> vs nadal   good match
it had to be me   saw the fork in the road and went straight  the exception is me!
too many left turns   time to make rights
i don't buy bullshit   already know what the price is â‚¬ 
is it just me or does lauderhill have the worst possible people   #jamaicants 
born to dream but living a nightmare   
true to da game   as long as the blood is blue in <propfemale> veins 
mind inna nother world*
no need to check <propfemale> itinerary   cause i ten aready 
one man team   u won't make the cut 
i guess i'm the asshole   
i wonder what it all really means   to find my dreams 
i close my eyes and imagine   
correcting my wrong moves   like a game of chess 
checkmate   
let me die young   or live forever 
why am i fighting to live   if i'm just living to fight 
i want what everyone man wants   more 
genocide   killin'em
why is it that the simplest people always have the most   
success on <propfemale> mind   motivation in <propfemale> pockets 
too much on <propfemale> plate   but i'm ready to grub 
"i got da right to do it, so imma do it right   "
talking to maself but i <propfemale> listen   
leaving impressions like when dah paper meets dah marker   
slave to money then you die   the beautiful life 
inna new york state a mind   nothings equivalent 
"life   i wonder, will it take me under?"
heaven can wait   trying to survive in hell 
"this week has been a bad massage, i need a #happy-ending "
and a new beginning   
back to the drawing board   
what's a god to a non-believer? who don't believe in anything 
like father like son   
in the mirror looking at my only enemy   
sins of <propfemale> father <propfemale>de my life ten times harda   
doctors say i'm dah illest cause i suffer from realness   
"my dreams are big, reality woke me up "
no one is as ever good as they seem   
mama raised a warrior   
too much enemy fire to catch a friendly   
reality catching up with me 
just made the laydown of my life   
"if you think too long on your next step,you'll end up in life standing on one leg  half of our decisions n life r made 2 please others  f\em"""
made for this   
"a life of reaction is a life of slavery, intellectually and spiritually  one must fight for a life of action,not reaction  #makeit"
