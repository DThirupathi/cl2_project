"i'm staring at an ad to turn your picture into an avatar character, and i've decided that it looks like they've morphed smurfs and the people from cats together  slightly reminiscent of the blue chick from xmen  ah, crap  what was her name?"
"please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone, who needs a punch in the face  people who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many  there is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face, except a punch in the face, but we can raise awareness "
