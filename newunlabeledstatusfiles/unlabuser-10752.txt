"half of my heart says i'm perfectly lonely, the other half says, not so much "
lets see how creative my facebook friends are   leave me a 1 word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name   it can only be one word   then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you  don't just post and not copy   that's no fun!!
well thats the first time ive ever had to put lukas to bed early   an hour and a half early! hes been crabby crabby crabby and wouldnt stop throwing a fit so i put him to bed   and hes actually ok with it   so i guess maybe he just needs the sleep x- 
seriously tired!
well here goes nothing   i have lukas in underwear today just to see how he does  i told him if he pees or poops on <propmale> that <propmale> will cry so hopefully that works  lol

lukas is sick today  sad  poor boy  diarrhea and now he just puked all over my bed  im trying to get him to drink some pedialyte to keep him hydrated 
poor boy is still sick  but he's in better spirits  after cleaning it up and cuddling again before bed he wanted me to sing him songs and he sang with me so thats a good sign
