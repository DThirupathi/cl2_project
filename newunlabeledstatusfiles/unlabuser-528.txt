about 5:26 am  haven't slept  can't sleep  to much to think about and do and what not  wow  alright i'm going back to just laying here
starting to hate social networks  their always full of bad news
i tend to listen to my dreams  somehow they guide me where to go  might move might not  well see  it was a weird dream 
i know what i have to do and how i'm gonna try to do it  just have to see if it works 
hey check out deth label  mt band  really good
trying to write a song  one down  i don't have a name for it however  gonna have to come up with something
have some cool teachers  still with almost nobody in any of my classes it's gonna be gay
"school is going and so is time, so take advantage of every opportunity and forget the \what ifs?\"""""
finally i have updated pictures up 
"and as all of these people try to change me all i can think is please shut the fuck up  \adley kreider original"
how come i'm over joyed when everyone around me is suffering? its because i'm f'ing awesome thats why! a k  original
"i love the way i am and their is no changing in the future  and if that means you hate me, then stay the hell away  that would make me happy  a k  original"
"get to start drivers <propmale> on monday, woooo   "

"why is it that most people need lots and lots of good things to be happy and have a good day, but it only takes one little thing to ruin that day and make you forget the good?"
"homecoming, b-day and some other crap happening tomorrow  great"
"i'm feeling good about the future, i'm forgetting the past, and i'm in the present doing my best to change the future and shape my past so when i'm gone you all will know where i am and how i got their because when today ends and tomorrow begins i'm gonna be remembered for how i prevailed and not how i'v failed\a k  original"
"if you have anytime to ever think about me, then do it because your always on my mind for whatever thats worth i try to make you happy, but i can't theres no real opportunity for me to do what it is that i need to  i can feel it in my bones, there so heavy, but i don't stop no i won't stop for nothing i'm on my way and for those who don't like it they can fuck it"
anyone want to check out a movie tomorrow let me know
"theirs times in this world where we all have some problems and it takes all that we have just to come back from them, but thats easier sad then done and we are almost done why should we put up with these problems when we could just grab a gun? its for the thrill of the fun and were never gonna get so undone that we end it on a lousy problem that we could over if we just try some"

"i do all that i can to show what i'm worth but keep coming up short in the eyes of who matter to me so i move off to the side and let you be on your way to the next to attempt to impress, but i feel such a need to make you smile and be the reason you breath i can't stand to see another occupy that position i strive to be in "
"look in my eyes and my heart is yours, reach out and touch my soul    i truly adore you and always have i'll stand by your side, forever yours  and i'll come running by every time you call for only to help you though this all  when life stands up and you fall    i'll always to catch you and be your wall "
still yours forever
    
clocked behind this veil of secrets and lies is a truth that waits to be discovered  only time will revile the life contained until all realize what is truth and what is truly lies
baked off your and in thrown in the devils oven i lay and burn like a <propmale> in the <propfemale> but even <propfirst> down in <propfemale> didn't have the weed needed to get him high this time so he took his soul and fiddle made of gold back down to hell were we light it up until fire fell in around us 
"you may say i mess around, you may say i'm loser but don't you tell me that i didn't care i just think that your beautiful and i can't think when your next me  i just need you in my life i will hold and surrender my nights, let me focus myself to you, i could be true to you  just don't say i don't care "
"help me now i'm so down, need a little lift to be back on my feet thats all i need  if thats to much i'll understand and stay here on my back <propfemale> around until i do what i need to help myself  so profound this fee<propfemale> of helplessness a turtle knows how to roll back and fourth ohhh i need to learn how to roll back and fourth back and fourth   "
"for the sunshine of day will never be cast once again onto your beautiful face, and i will not have another <propmale> to look deep into your eyes and because of this i will forever walk the dark nights until i find you my love in the light of you and i "

"\there are things known and things unkown and in between are the doors   \"" \",0b03d53640a8675b8f68c6700d79909f,"\you've turned to a monster\"""""
justice at last this week  i'm happy for you
"why is it every morning i awake i look for your posts to reach into your mind, but don't know a damn thing about you other than what i've read?"
shakespeare's macbeth is actually a really great story  surprising

"\breathing deeply walking backwards finding strength to call and ask her  \"""""

sitting back and loosing yourself in some alternative rock punk rock can do some good some days 
"austen f'n <propmale> is a f'n b'a, o'k?"
good morning friday  lets makes this one good
"friday, you pulled through and really made this a great day  thanks and can't wait until i see you again a week from now "
"movie tonight whooooo, great"

nobody looks up enough
"square one, i'm back "
"one day bump, but missed going into the rut  i'm ready now "
lets get shit done
"come with me, and i promise to treat you right, make you happy, and give you all you want"
dammit

"over 6 billion people in the world, 195 countries in the world, 7 continents in the world, 50 states in the us, 51 cities in montana, 77 towns in montana, and i met you  what are the f'n' odds?"
thanks facepage
wednesday     thats pretty much it
that douche should go into the bathroom and drown himself 
"just keep on trying, even if you don't achieve what you <propfemale> keep trying  its the best we can do in this world  a lot of what we do is overlooked and unnoticed but you know when you have tried and given 100%  keep on trying"
"\the truth may set you free but first its going to piss you off \"""""
do you ever feel helpless? like you just can't make this? like maybe its worthless to try and create this? you may be right 
what are we doing this weekend? anyone?
"so when all else fails, when you feel lost, trapped, and all alone, try and remember that you life lies within your hands  you have the power to change it, and everything hangs on the hinge of a single moment "
dammit! why can't i just make things right?! fuck!!
"soul equals meaning, thats you, but your leaving, so take my soul i don't need it, i won't need it because without you i feel like led \my heart, your hands, my life, your plan  what i need, what i want, see your face and see my tears, i need this, i feel this  you feel this? oh baby just heal this!\ oh i just need to see your face again, i love the way you smile and tempt my heart with eyes   "
"i'm sorry, i do miss you "
i just feel like breaking down and letting go 
i like to think we create our own lives  that there is no all powerful or fateful plan  just me making what i want  sometimes we just can't do everything  i guess that focus <propfemale> and drive isn't always enough
"friday night, good music and facepage  just what i wanted  wink "
"we drop our fears and pain   \                                           so our souls can soar"
wow i really want to die before all of you
absolutly no reason to get up today
"sunday, no egotistical comment really fits today   damn"
"a nice day out makes me feel great, refreshed, amazing  you make me feel, wonderful, new, perfect  hmmm    now we need to talk haha"
"focus is regained today, but lost tomorrow"
i have a smile
"and as i walk out the door, i see you walk in   then decide to stay with "
"sweet, so wow  felt like i went a little down hill today "
"wow just reading comments, tells me this guy is an ass whole  austen i really don't like that guy"
"baby you and me are like magnets constantly pushing and pulling away and together until were together i'm a keep pulling you closer, and though you push me away i won't take it personally because i want this though you don't i know but i'm stubborn and won't allow you to turn you back and walk away, i'll follow,"
"all of you people who have never given a damn about me, i'm sorry i couldn't make you care "
