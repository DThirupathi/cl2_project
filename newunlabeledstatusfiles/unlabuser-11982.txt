well it seems as though the browns stayed home today 
i leave my friends house to beat the rain but it starts pouring when i'm halfway home  2nd day in a row this has happened to me  wtf?
"another day, another test of my sanity"
awake and very bored
"for the first time in a long while, i actually feel a shred of happiness  this has been a very good week for me "
got a show coming up  first one in awhile  will i be able to pick up were i left off? tune in next week to find out  or just come to the show    
just got back from practice and the people should beware     we will rip your faces off and eat them!!!!
5 smile 0 in the morning    can't sleep   can't calm my brain enough for it to be silent     i hate this
the band got lucky and found equipment that was stolen after our last show  can't wait to find out the person's name that stole our shit  we found it at guitar center after a week! what are the odds?
"5 days until the show at headliners  the tickets are only $5 so come out, have a few drinks and have a hell of a good time because a  it's a friday night b  we're playing 3 brand new songs  and  c  it's only 5 bucks!!! get ahold of any of the band members if you want tickets "
well only 4 days left until the show  all those who told me that they want a ticket better hurry up cause there's not much time left  you know who you are
"another show that's in the bag  we were the only band that had costumes on(well <propmale>, <propfirst>, and i)  had a great time and i hope everyone who showed up had a great time as well"
"just got this one today: next sat  the 13th, my band is playing at <propfirst>'s  don't know when doors open yet and i'm sure that tix  won't be more than $8 at most  you'll know more when i know more  please come out and show your support!! it's gonna be a good show cause we like playing at <propfirst>'s alot more than headliners  it's more intimate and the sound is way better "
the <propfemale> rules #1
"why do people feel the need to completely change themselves for other people who don't want anything to do with them unless they change  if someone can't accept you for who you are then they don't need to know you  and if you change yourself to fit someone else's preference, just know i will be calling you truly pathetic  always be true to yourself and fuck the rest who don't like it "
"on a side note, anyone know a good drummer? besides me? hahahaha "
"the world lost a very funny man yesterday  that man was <propfirst> nielson  i'm about to go put on naked gun, have some \medicine\"" and laugh my ass off  r i p  <propfirst> drebin  sorry you can't shoot anyone anymore """
"if nothing is forever, what makes love the exception? hey ya   ?"

i like this pic better  i was a voltron freak when i was a kid?
"my favorite super hero, the green lantern  who's your favorite??"
"i always said he'd come to no good in the end your honor! if they'd let me have my way i could've flayed him into shape  but my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists let him get away with murder! let me hammer him today!"
"\large breasts have been names of men can not give up\""  this was the last sentence from a <propfemale> <propfirst> bio that was translated from turkish to english  broken english is so funny to me sometimes"""
the red skull in cap's costume? great picture  yea i'm a nerd so what? deal with it
"well, time to play ff7 until the sun comes up "
very tired     this <propfirst> bearer jig is getting old    don't know how many more times i do it     
"man, my b-day is thursday  do i really have to be 29? ugh    "

booo! i want to play warhammer online but my comp lacks the ability
you know what makes a person feel good? getting blown off by a friend after you told them that you wanted to <propfemale> out with them on your birthday  yup feels like a million bucks     and it begs the question: what kind of friends are these anyways?
thanks everybody  you really know how to make an old guy feel special  playful 
why can't i sleep?!?!?!

"i saw you today   you didn't know it but i was watching    and i have to say that my hatred for you is otherworldly  if you were on fire, i wouldn't waste my piss on you to save your life  you are nothing is the eyes of everyone  oh what i would give to smash your face with a hammer then keep going until your head is just a crunchy puddle of bone and brains  damn you for eternity   "
"i've been thinking about the human race today  why are we here, what's our purpose, the only thing that i keep coming back to is that we will never know our true origin and purpose because we aren't meant to know because human brains can't fully grasp the concept of our purpose  we live in a world that revolves around our senses but what about the things outside of our senses? i leave to ponder this and more "
"so  i got a kidney stone on my left side  intense pain, puked twice from the pain  i think it's from drinking too much milk "

"watching the dark knight for just the 2nd time and i'll admit it  <propmale> leger played a pretty good joker  although i still like <propfirst> nicholson just a little more as joker  i'm old school i guess  but then again, christian bale is by far the best batman"
"chocolate cake, coming up!"
ok new band name  i'm ragar!
"ok i'm 90% sure about what i want to call my next band: the plagues  i wanna go old school with it  old thrash, old punk and maybe a little ministry and death thrown in for flavor  i even want it to sound like an old vinyl record  i'm going back to my roots when music wasn't soul-less crap like most of the shit today is"
"so there is now a scholarship for white people  i think it's a good thing cause i thought of it years ago and the fact that there are white people that actually need the help  and wouldn't ya know it? everyone's making a big deal out of it and they're mostly black  it's ok for women, blacks or whoever else to get them but not white people? gimme a fucking break  who's really the racist ones here?"

"was watching cnn and it blows my mind to know that because of the quake, japans main island was moved 2 4 meters and the earth was tilted 10 cm  when you put it in perspective considering the sheer size and mass, that's huge   "
playing castlevania sotn  got really pissed and said fuck it and started over with a walkthrough of castle 1 and 2 saved in my files  don't give a damn if it's cheating or not  i'm not gonna get stuck again and wander in circles while steam blows out of my ears     
"let us go out this evening for pleasure, the night is still young    "
"the plagues begin practicing on tuesday  and we have an offer to play the toledo music fest in 3 months  i'd really like to do it but we'll see on how the progress goes  if we're ready, then hell yea we'll do it"
