wishes everyone else would stop acting like life sucks  mine's freakin' awesome so stop trying to drag me down too       that may sound a little off color but i can't sleep right now and there's a certain person who can probably guess why 
is sad because he won't get to see his savana for ten whole days   sad 
nothin' much really
"you say fridy, i say only four days to school, wow, i'm soooooooo excited      yeah right  i wish summer was a bit longer as it stands"
"senior, ugh, i'm not ready to go back  oh well got to anyway i guess, it starts tomorrow  guess i'll see everyone back at the same old same old huh? hope everyone enjoyed their summer and for those of you who are my classmates, hope you're ready to start your lives for real, i know i wish i had more time      "

"hey you, i won't get done with madrigals tonight until 9 surprise 0 so it might be like 9:15 or so before i call, love you"
"please forgive my humore, i am but your fool"
"so, i gave up video games for lent, no big deal right    then i get on facebook to kill timeguess what most of my facebook time killing consists of    flash games and things like you know, farm town, cityville, and cafe world    guess who just had facebook ruined for him for another 38 days    i miss the days when i was ignorant and just gave up lent for lent   "
