"staring down the barrel of a bottle,\smelling the wonderful snowfall,\inhaling the garden,\every day, every way \everyones elevated in their own way \so breath deeply friends,\tis a feast of magic and euphoria ahead   "
where's my intellectual heads at lol

ok   so i feel that for some reason i just can't shake old urges   i try and try and try
"ok so before i lay my head to rest, i want to leave you with these words  \if only i could live my life in a euphoric state all the time   i might not accomplish must but i have felt peace and happiness"""
and a parting thought before i tumble to sleep   why is it everytime i do right things never work out in my favour unless its a small thing then its me but if i do wrong i still don't fair that well   maybe i'm just like everyone else    misunderstood  lol
ok so for real i'm supahblowwd its 3am noone is awake  not at the hoose so erryone just gotta bear with me  it was time to enjoy myself    and i have 
so ya things are goin iight even though they is a few things that could hurry 
why is it for some fucked up reasoning that no matter what i do no matter how hard i try i can't seem to please all   damnit why do i have to be me? can't do shit right and can't please anyone   fuck em  its my turn to shine 
"\do you have excess drama in your life  try dramacodone  available in small to excess dosages for all your drama needs \"""""

ok so i stepped off the map for a day    <propfemale> me  everything happens for a reason  its has for centuries 
"sitting alone in the dark,\i heard a cry that sent a start,\venture to my place,\sit down in disconnection,\the problem seems to be   \i can't look at my reflection "
"tossing and turning,\midnight oil burning,\all the love i found,\all the happiness i've unwound,\scattered on the ground   \self destruction so soon,\my figure slowly swoons,\down to the ground   again"
the question of the day    what happened?lmao
"lying alone in the pillows tonight,\way too well off,\i asked for reprieve,\i begged an answer,\tried so hard to understand   \it seems the other me was afraid of me   \what an animal?what have i done?\it seems the answer was sent in mysterious ways   "
is currently awaiting next shift in six and half hours lol work til 5 then a bbq baby
"staring at the scattered reflections on the floor,\an epiphany fell unto me   \the wine spilt so beautifully   \making all the scattered reflections human again   \unearthing a long fought battle   \revealing the deepest of demons   \and a beckoning cry to fall on deaf ears   "
ok worked today and work in the am and try and waste some time   sounds like a go to me  all systems cleared for takeoff lol

actually at this point   i'm merely ready to get smashed  too much bullshit not enough actual real shit   
"falling awake again,\staring at the ceiling   \dull throbbing in my head,\what did i do?\recollecting my recklessness,\i look at me and see,\maybe things just aren't what they seem   "

"chop me up, break me down   \line me up, boil me down   \snort me up, smoke me down   \open wide and enjoy the rush,\let me rock you,\let me roll you,\let me be your drug of choice   "
"so we be rollin to my fave time of the am here in about 10 <propfemale>, i'm thrilled lol"
"the sun used to shine,\the birds used to sing,\now all i hear is chaos,\now all i feel is pain   \the skies used to smile,\the wind calmly blew,\now the blackened skies linger,\now my personality skewed   \things have changed,\times have passed,\the people mutate,\the hope is gone   \look at the floor,\where all my reflections stare back at me   \the blood stained imagery   \if only i didn't hate me for being me   "
waiting for tomorrow night    *sigh*it never gets here quick

"and so i laid my head to rest,\but the demons inside contest   \voices, noises, and sickness in my head   \if this shall continue, then all is lost for me   \so i laid my head to sleep,\yet another another demon to defeat    "
"twisted thoughts in my head,\now i lay down to my bed   \demons wandering,\the other me pondering   \what wicked shall i unleash under the pale moonlight?"
good god    i have flip flopped my schedule all around now

"so, before i step back into my lil coma, i will say thank you for another day, another breath, and another smile  thank you for another night, another tear, and another <propmale> for peace  thank you "
time to put the waders on   shits just got deep 
"sometimes i ride, get high, find a place to park  stare at the sky sit there wondering why i feel pain, i can't describe, as opposed to lettin it go i just hold it inside  got tears behind my eyes i refuse to release, hatred in my heart, god forgive me please   "
"counting the blessings laid unto thee,\my heart flees at the things   \the faces, places, and realms beyond outer space   \a smile begins to grow,\and my eyes will soon show   \how truly blessed i have and shall be   "
"so whilst my mind is open,\i was sincerely hopin',\that everything would be right   \a wish on a star,\and smoke rings in the dark   \reveal to me the feel of peace   "
"ahh, camping  inner peace comes out "
thank you dad  you have taken me back to when i was and still am your <propfemale> boy campout in the backyard this time becuz of rain was definitely cool with me  thanks
"so gonna head back home bout 11am, but imma say one thing for the day  it was all well worth  i fished( didn't catch shit) but i also took time to enjoy the more peaceful side of things   all the simplicity   so intricate in the ways it baffles and befuddles me  but still amazing  thanks to those involved  thanks a million"
watching the masses feed  watching the stampede  here lil hungry one  here a scrap  beg 
"the dawning of a new day,\time for old demons to play   \anger and rage seemingly neverending,\i'm finally done pretending   \shattered reality hits the floor,\a whole new beast was born   \when the poison bled from his veins   \untamed and ruthless,\medicated comas faded out   \you woulda liked me better blowwd out "
