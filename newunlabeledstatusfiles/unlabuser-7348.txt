so give me reason to prove me wrong to wash this memory clean let the floods cross the distance in your eyes give me reason to fill this hole connect this space between let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide
"i wont let you down,  if i'm not around and you will be free,  and i will be myself i wont fill your eyes with tears,  if i lose all my fears but who would i be?  and would you recognize me? tell me who would you see?  when you say    that i would be ours"

"she never lets me fall too far behind, i won't walk ahead of her i won't, two notes of a chord side by side, two steps down a path between the vine  i feel the magic of a girl who who'll bring the best of me out through, i think i'd rather be close to you"
