"one review down, one more to go  why did i procrastinate on this knowing i have an 8 am class tomorrow?"
i just successfully figured out how to view someone's facebook photo albums who you are not friends with and have their photos set to private  this is a sign that i spend way too much time on facebook when i have a really important assignment to do and am wasting time because i don't feel like working on it
