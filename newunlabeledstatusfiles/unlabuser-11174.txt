we are all perceived differently by different people dependent upon our history and happenings with them

why is it that mental midgets want to hate on people that like to read and take courses to educate themself?  since when is learning a bad thing?  the mental midget haters need to learn a thing or two for themselves and stop the negativity because they want what you have and know what you know!!!  bounce that shit!

perspective is an amazing thing   you think you are well read and know quite a bit and then someone else that is a bit more well read and knowledgeable slaps you in the face with a different perspective that changes yours completely or partially   what you know is sometimes a limitation of what else there is to learn   chew on that!

tie buddies have saved my life!  i will never have to tie kosey's shoes again!  yeah!  he can tie them himself!
i am so pissed right now   my son just cut holes in a leather chair and cut a bean bag chair open a few days ago   i want to beat his ass but that will do no damn good   i have punished him to sit in his room in the chair he cut and think about what he has been doing   he will not watch tv or play with any toys for two weeks   he is lucky that is all i am doing to his ass right now!!!
it is pretty amazing how some people have selective memories and all they want to do is  bring up shit that happened in the past (that you did or didn't do) but when you bring some shit up that they did they want to cry that you are trying to make them miserable   such hypocrites!  they need to learn when to keep their mouths shut   all the comments they make fall upon deaf ears because i don't give a shit anyway!
what is the matter with peeps these days?  they walk by you and you can smile and say hello and they will just keep walking like they don't even see you there!  people are not friendly!  it is a damn shame!

some people are so hateful even when u have done nothing to them but because of their own hang-ups  these people should learn how 2 stop being so judgmental worrying about what u do and how u handle your business and concentrate on their own life  it is the coward that cannot tell u how they feel about u and it is a shame because u could and would have let them go a long time ago because they are not healthy for u   
"decisions made may someday come with regret tomorrow  \judge not lest yea be judged   <propfemale> is going to haunt those that wish to\be judgmental, mean-spirited and hateful toward others   i choose to treat others\with respect even when i don't agree with their behavior or actions and i\accept them for who they are even when they don't deserve it "
"without truth nothing is sacred  we all play a grave roll in our own demise  the truth gives us power  the weak use fear against against the strong  the path you take is not your own if you listen to the ramblings of evil  think about how precious life is, how difficult it is to create and how easy it is to take away  choose light over darkness     (inspired by the minister's speech in belly)"
"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all  = means bite your tongue before you say something you'll regret, asshole!"
i think i have so much weight in the belly it is making me have leg cramps in the front of my legs like <propfemale> splints   hurts like hell!  momma mia!
i am so mentally and physically exhausted   i really need to reevaluate my life   overhaul   
a smile is the same in every language!  smile!   smile 
"wow! today is actually a nice, peaceful day at work!  maybe this is a sign of good things to come   "
"kosey lost his 1st tooth today!  oh, my baby is growing up too fast!  it makes me happy and sad at the same time   "
"baked some oatmeal-raisin, white chocolate chip cookies!  yummy!  kosey better get home before we eat them all!"
it is in a person's best interest to do their job to the best of their ability  your performance and how u treat your clients reflect on your integrity   u must treat all clients with the utmost respect and courtesy  a pleasant e playful erience relays positive messages to future clients  spreading the message by word-of-mouth is the cheapest way to market your skills   
yippee!  <propfirst> won't be patrolling the streets of chicago anymore!  and he will be working days!  love it!
i had a dream about my gramps and the show the lone ranger!  takin' it back!  way back!
i have been up since 2 sneezin with allergies! i am tired as hell!
"i have been so lazy this weekend   oh, well   "
do what you do   
kosey has picture day tomorrow!  then off to the dentist to get his first filling!  see what happens when the parent stops brushing the damn kids teeth?!
all went well   kosey was very good at the dentist   now he has some nice white fillings   thanks dr  v!  you are the best!
tgif! time 4 some  r&r 
why is it that people think that they don't have to treat you with respect or talk to you when you are around them but think they can ask you for a favor when they want something from you?
today's cookies are:  reese's chewy chocolate cookies with walnuts and toffee   yummy!  tasty stuff!
life is good   love others like you love your child(ren) 
"oh, i just love these sleepless nights   "
as one door closes another is soon to open 
off to county line orchard!  yummy!
"all my friends and family are beautiful, classy, strong and i love them all!  i wish you all to live your lives to the fullest   please believe in your abilities and may you all excel beyond your e playful ectations  also, may you all shine even in the darkest of places!"
"hallelujah! i am back in business!  massage location has been relocated!  like i said as one door closes, another opens   "
"kosey was just talking about how one transcends through life: he was saying to himself     you are a baby, then kindergarten, first grade   6th grade   high school, college, then you are a grown up, then you become an old man and eventually you die!  that boy is too much!"
"kosey just told his father that he wasted his whole saturday (we have been out from about 10 smile 0-7) and didn't get to have no fun!  now mind you, this child got toys and something else     this kid is just too much for me!  spoiled brat!"
"damn, cleaning this house sucks!  gotta keep it clean for the baby shower!  i will beat these boys if they mess up my house again!  i don't think the hubby will because he has spent most of the day cleaning the basement!  what a great man!  muah!"
"time is on my side, yes it is!"
"can anyone mind their business? can anyone be considerate and kind? can anyone ever just let shit go and stop dwelling on dumb, judgemental nonsense? can folks just learn how to communicate and grow the hell up? i think it's time!"
can u just b happy 4 urself & others? learn how 2 b @ peace with urself & then i think u will c the err of ur judgemental & ignorant ways
i think i have a ganglion cyst in my finger!

love and sex are good but sex is so much better when love is involved 
"damn, what is gonna happen next?  first i have a damn cyst in my finger and now my neck on the left side is radiating pain down into my shoulder!  uuuuuggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!"
hmmmm    do we take kosey to the lego-fest at mccormick place this weekend?  maybe we will 
"\a mind that has been stretched will never return to its original dimension\"" <propfirst> einstein"""
"happy halloween!  off to lego kid-fest at mccormick place, then trick-or-treat time!"
tired! back home from trick-or-treating   my kid is the only one i know that fills his bucket and then says he is done     i used to go for hours until i had a pillow case full!
why am i so damn busy this week?
"this weekend is exhausting me     but it is fun spending time with my gal <propfirst>, nephew <propfirst> and my wonderful boys   "
baby shower time! see a lot you you later on! this is going to be a fun-filled day!  xoxoxox!
i just want to thank all my friends & family for coming out and spending time with us and giving the best gift of all-your presence  xoxox!
took my girl <propfirst> to the airport!  i miss her already!  love you girlie!
32 weeks down  8 or so more to go   
"if i hear, \i'm afraid i am gonna hurt the baby \"" one more damn time!"""
impatiently waiting   
"damn, i don't get enough sleep as it is and the one day i am sleeping really soundly is the one day that my son decides to wake my ass up! unreal!"
yeah baby! nachitos from el taco real  damn they hit the spot and are just as tasty as i remember!
this has been a hell of a crappy & scary day  car accident early this morning-hit & run  now sitting in triage because my hubby is worried & the doc wanted me to get checked too  i am drained!
just stuck my ass wit an iv & <propfirst> blood  damn 
"everyone, i am fine (at least physically speaking), kosey is fine, and the baby seems to be ok as well   the person that caused the accident has not surfaced   i am overwhelmed by all the craziness of the yesterday so i am trying to take it easy   i am going through some mental stuff right now after all this so please keep me and my family in your prayers!  thank you "
"y r we so busy doing?(nothing!)we r so busy doing that we stop just being!we r rushing here & there, but where exactly r we going?no where fast!i have realized that with the incident i went through that i am not as invincible as i thought and that i am sometimes at the mercy of others "
"when it rains it pours     r i p  uncle <propfirst>   i pray for my gramma and mother for i would never want to know what it is like to lose a sibling or one of my children   it would be too much for anyone to take   i know i personally cannot take anymore stress, i am going over the deep end   try to be strong, but can't be strong when you feel powerless, all i want to and have been doing is cry   sad "
i am feeling so much better today than i have for the last few   it helps to talk to family and friends so that you can work through the stresses and distress   i appreciate everyone that took the time to talk and also that were concerned enough to ask how my family and i are doing   i love you all   i think we will be fine now   just fine 
"why must we be \conflicted with the harsh reality of difficult life decisions?  why do \we feel afflicted with such immeasurable pain?  i believe it is a test \of our character and integrity   why else would life be so unbearable at\ times?  i feel drained "
my hip has been killing me since friday 
f*ck!  i am so tired!  but back to triage!
bag of water leaking  baby coming today 
welcome 5lb 9oz emmrick javaris <propmale> into the world  my little turkey 
"well, thank u all 4 the kind words  emmerick is doing great, he is cute as can be  i am sore as heck from the c-section  luv u all!"
i hope my baby gets to come home with me when i go 
drugged up and sore as hell 
"i am sad, i go home today without my baby "
"certain people need to stop \downplaying\"" how i feel about my son not coming home with me   i will not name names but you know who the hell you are!"""
well i go home in a couple hours  it will be hard but i have to leave my baby boy  gonna go home and rest and be back to see him tomorrow 
what a great night sleep in my own bed  now off to see my baby 
just because i don't agree with you doesn't make me wrong   just because i voice my opinion about what is said doesn't mean i am being a bitch either 
my baby is eating more and gaining his lost weight back 
my spine throbs all the way up my damn back  can i just get a break soon?
"i am so happy, there is light at the end of the tunnel afterall, the head rn told me that emmerick will potentially come home this weekend or sometime next week!  yippeee!  i hope he continues to progress!  he is a little sleepy butt at the moment "
"kosey is the sweetest big brother i kjow  he made a card for his baby brother that says \to:emmerick  i love you baby  come home now \"""""
"you cannot reason with an unreasonable person \you will always be judged by the judgmental \you can never have an opinion around the opinionated \the hypocrite will never admit to their hypocrisy \\12 3 2010  kkr"
"well, emmerick gained some weight     he is 5lbs  4 2 oz  still not \eating all the time the 45cc's recommended but he is well on his way   i\ am just getting frustrated by the whole ordeal because i want him to \come home! damn it!"
my boy is eating all his food and then some since 12 am this morning   if he continues for the rest of the 24 hours they will take out the tube!  i am praying they take the damn thing out   then he comes home for sure!  yeah baby!
"i will not show you what i don't want you to see \i will not tell you what i don't want you to hear \when it comes to me, \what you observe is who i am \what i speak is the truth \understand?"
the tube is out at 3! my baby is coming home wednesday or thursday  yahoo! i am excited!
"my baby boy is coming home tomorrow  happy, happy,joy,joy,happy, happy, joy!!!"
"alright, off to the hospital to bring my baby emmerick home!  they better not give me any b s  as to why he cannot come home today or they will see the nasty side to me!  lol!  xoxox!"
well the lil stubborn boy did not pass the car seat test so he tries again tonight  hopefully home tomorrow  another hurdle   
"the american pediatric association requires a premature infant be able to sit in a car seat for 1 1 2 hours with no bradycardia, apnea or other incidence of duress   i have to wait until tomorrow to see if he passes the test   northwestern makes sure that all premies are ready to come home before they discharge him   these are the brakes   "
this time is 4 real  my baby is coming home today!
emmerick's 1st night home was good   he kept me up all night and ate like a glutton and then this morning he had to be bathed because he pissed and crapped all over the place!  the joys of motherhood!  i love every minute of it!  i am happy he is home where he belongs!
sometimes no news is good news   
emmerick pee'd all over his gramma!  that was funny!  & my gramma brought tears to my eyes with her birth stories!
my head is pounding! i hate these damn headaches!  bah!
"two peeps on tv are under the covers with shirts on and kosey says, \are they showing some sex?  i don't want to see no sex!\"" where the hell does he come up with this mess?"""
off to see kosey's winter show at school!  it should be fun!  haven't been out anywhere since emmerick was born other than the hospital   
"met kosey's teacher and she said he is a very special child  hell, must be doing something right as parents  he is special to us too "
omg! why the hell is toys r us so damn packed? and the line is 5 <propmale> long and moving slow as hell! kosey better love his mom  they are the only ones that have this damn car!!!
"it amazes me when i look at kosey's baby pictures, how both my boys look so similar "
a refusal to love ourselves often manifests as illness   learn what it means to love yourself people!
"when you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling   live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying tears of joy "
"when one door closes in life, another one opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one that has been opened for us   open your eyes and pay attention!"
"it can b life transforming to relive our pasts becuz it can help us confront illusions about ourselves  we won't remember unless we want 2 find our truth  the truth of our memories does set us free, helping us 2 understand who we are  it helps us release emotional patterns that don't work in turn supporting our health "
my baby weighed 8lbs 2 oz at the doctor visit today! has a hernia that i hope will heal itself over the next few years   has to drink water everyday  but all in all he is a healthy boy   just didn't like the hep b shot     sad 
"happy new year!  i am chillin' at home with my boys!  be safe if you are gonna go to a party!  have fun too!  love, peace and happiness to you all!"
"try not to control every minute of your life  when we control, we plan where we're going to go and then direct ourselves there  but think about it   most of the time when we plan something or arrive where we wanted to go we end up discovering that  didn't get what we wanted or go where we wanted after-all "
"fear should not guide our behavior, it makes us compromise  compromise makes us untrue to ourselves  being untrue to ourselves makes us unfulfilled  time to find inner guidance!"
"i was feeling pretty good for running a little over a mile and then i read that babies can get colic from a mother having stress in her third trimester  just fabulous, e playful lains why emm is crying between 11 to 1 lately   "
i am so proud of my boy kosey!  he got mostly all a's and only one b! he told me next time he would have no c's and he sure was right!  reading and writing went from c's to a's!  smart boy!
"why do people think that it is alright to blatantly disrespect you and go against your wishes and do some trifling shit that they know you would not appreciate?  well, i got news     all these people did was create conflict and loss of a privilege and they don't even know it yet   all because people want to be spiteful  see where that gets you now   "
wow!  silence in the house!  all the boys are asleep!
"it should be our goal to develop sincerity, the capacity to mean what we say, both to ourselves and others "
"i tell you, i am so proud of my boy kosey!  he just got his scores back for the dibels and he exceeded the goal scores in all three categories!  1st category goal laugh 5 his score=50; 2nd category goal=50 his score 114; 3rd goal=20 his score 62    he is my little brain!"
i seriously love the independence of working on my own not having to take orders from others   it is truly wonderful!
"oh, this is going to be fun  a nice weekend away for a couple days     bye!"

i can't stand people! y is it: when u r in an elevator 2 get out the people waiting 2 get on r in ur damn way becuz they r in a rush; when u r walking through a crowd some moron continues to hit the back of your heals with the stroller; that people rush 2 walk in front of u but then walk as slow as hell; that u r holding a door open for someone with a baby & everyone cuts in front of them? rude ignoramuses i tell ya!
back in the saddle again!  i'm back! back in the saddle again!  hell yes and it is a good thing!
do not boast about your knowledge  be humble 
"some people feel better about themselves placing blame for failed relations on the other party instead of blaming themselves for their part in it!  keep on being so naive   you are the guilty one, keep up the mirage of your farce!  i will no longer care about the nonsense others try project onto me!"
i loathe the lepers that dance in senseless articulation within their abysmal cesspool of foolishness   
"na-a nawa rokha payati vinasanti = we pray for the 1 whom we touch, that he she will be happy & that illness will be released from him her "
it is a damn shame when your child asks you why he doesn't see certain people in his family anymore   all i can say is that i have tried to call to talk but my attempts have failed  no answer or return call 
"the door will remain open, i have no e playful ectations, negative feelings no longer plague me, i let go and will continue to <propfemale> with love  that is all i can do "
the mouth is the gateway to all the diseases of the body 
i want to send a shout-out to my sister <propfirst>  congratulations on finishing your nail tech certification! i am proud of you! see you at 6 for the graduation!
damn  kosey threw up today  my poor babies 
"opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls, and looks like work  -<propfirst> a  <propmale>"
"stress: everyone e playful eriences it  no on is immune, because it is a necessary component of life  but you don't have to let it overpower you  learn how to manage it "
kosey thinks he is <propmale> dangerfield  he told me we don't give him any respect 
"when choosing between two evils, i always like to pick the one i never tried before \ <propfemale> west"""
"\the man who questions opinion is wise; the man who quarrels with fact is a fool \"" <propfirst> a  garbutt"""
"a tough decision has been made, i am deeply saddened but relieved that it is done   i will forever be indebted to a certain person for the rest of my life for giving me the freedom to be who i am and respecting my decisions   i love you and respect you "
some people are so desperate that they will screw someone else over in order to get what they want!  pathetic!
"integrity is so important   too bad so many people have none! your word is your bond   if you cannot stick to your word, you are nothing (but a liar)  do what you say and say what you do "
"i am so excited!  i have been asked to be a \success story\"" on my massage school website!  how awesome!"""
emmerick does not behave like he was 6 weeks early! that boy is eating bottles with thick oatmeal in it!  if he doesn't get it he will scream!  he is going to be a big boy!  jeez!
"you pave your own path in life, make it as smooth as possible, the less bumps along the way the better    make it good! love, peace & joy!"
being happy doesn't mean everything's perfect   it means you've decided to see beyond the imperfections 
emmerick just ate his first food!  pear's and he ate the whole jar!  jeez!  the boy is gonna be ginormous!
