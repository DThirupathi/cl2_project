its easy to forget why we facebook in the first place  i know i use it to upload photos of my family for my friends to see and to stay connected with people i think are good people  but being mean and saying things that are double sided are hurtful  if you write anything like i just described on my <propfemale> or status i will delete you as a friend
"day started off a little rough, but it's monday so its not really une playful ected "
how do i spend all morning cleaning and the house still looks like a toys r us tornado hit?
