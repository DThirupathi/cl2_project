<propfirst> did great with the hearing test  the lady was sooo nice and helpful! she had him sit on my lap in a closed room while she played sounds at different volumes  he responded to them by turning and looking for the sounds   got a little cranky at the end with being closed up in that little room  but it went well and he passed! so now we know that he hears us   he's just ignoring us! lol
day three of this week and babies are still well   thanks for pushing that button <propfemale>! lol

time has gone by so fast   and through the years we have lost touch with dear friends   but when we get to see them again after so much time has passed and we still feel that special friendship   that is a wounderful feeling 
ok  a part of my road is almost like a small pond   almost had to lock the truck in 4x4 just to get out of the neighborhood   water knee to mid thigh deep (and that's on the sides  hate to see how deep in the middle)   15 feet wide and 15 feet across   that's the mud life for ya!

"ok   jason went through the neighbors property last night  almost got stuck that way then almost got stuck in our yard  since 7 surprise 0 a m  he's been digging a ditch headed to the neighbors, then to the pond in the the road  it's going to take him all day  i would help but, can't leave the twins in the house  can you tell i am so disappointed  lol not, it's cold out there, not to mention that his feet are prob  soaked "
"well, the twins daycare is closed today   so, i can't go to work  i am tired of cleaning the house! need to do something fun today out of the house with the twins  maybe go to the op mall to walk around and then to argyle's mcdonald  they have a play area inside  what is everyone doing today?"

one day at a time   walking through a fog   missing my boy tyler   babies are growing sooo fast   troubled waters   day by day   that's all i can say!
"made baby chicks and <propfemale> cupcakes for the twins daycare easter party today, everyone was in awww, stopped at my usual place to get coffee and began to show the ladies there the pictures   they loved them sooo much that i got two orders for a dozen each, i think i should open a cupcake shop with novelty cupcakes, they are so much fun to make  and more fun to see peoples reactions  will get pictures up soon "
"well, the two dozen chicks and <propfemale> cupcakes have been filled and they loved them  while they were looking at them three customers came in  saw them   and wanted them   offered money on the spot for them  i need to set up a store  any investors? lol"

i am so proud of my children   parents teach their children right from wrong from infants to adulthood and pray that they have learned something alone the way   some learn harder than others  but as long as their mistakes don't hurt others and they learn from them right away   treat others with kindness and respect   love god   and are law abiding citizens   a mother's heart flutters with pride 
"i wish heaven had a phone so i could hear your voice again    i thought of you today, that is nothing new  i thought about you yesterday, & the days before that too  i think of you in silence, and often speak your name  all i have is memories, & a picture in a frame  repost this if you have someone in heaven ?"

wooohooo   day of work at the office is over   now time for my second job  mommyhood  getting babies  going home   making some dinner  and cleaning the house  when do i get my check for the mommyhood job? lol
someone that knew right from wrong and yet chose to do wrong over and over again at their own free will   that is someone that doesnâ€™t deserve your sympathy!
stole this from a friend     life isn't about being who everyone wants you to be    it's about being yourself and finding someone who loves every bit of it   
woohoo  it's official  it's been filed   now it's tick tock tick tock time     let's see how long it takes   anyone taking bets?

"true friends can go long periods of time \without speaking and never question their friendship     and pick up \like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been  \repost if you are lucky enough to have at least one  i am blessed to have \many!"
true definition of a mother   the person who holds their children's lives together when her own is falling apart!
*the truth will reveal itself w out you having to do anything*
"i might not be the most beautiful or the sexiest   nor have the perfect body   i might not be someone's first choice   but i am a great choice   i dont pretend to be someone else   cause i am to good at being me  i might not be proud of some of the things i've done  but i am proud of who i am today  take me as i am or don't take me at all!!!\copy & post this as your status if you love your life being you! ? ?"
