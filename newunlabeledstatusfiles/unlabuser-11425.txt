some fb group made me auto like it  how annoying 
finally the ap calculus test is over
high school has gone by fast 
if i had a pool party who would go?
grandma's house caught on fire today sad 
liam o-daniel-munger is at uofl's freshman orientation   
gotta love when your car overhears   
"car finally got fixed yesterday which, including yesterdays fee, totals to over $2000 spent towards fixing my car  at least i got pretty much everything replaced so i won't have to go back to a mechanic for a while "
