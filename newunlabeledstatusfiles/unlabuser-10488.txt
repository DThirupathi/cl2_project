i'm tired of people giving me shit about the people i care for    fuck off 
men should come with a hand book   it'd make things so much easier 
today starts a week of worry    but all i can really do is wish him luck and wait for his safe return    be safe booger 
missing him   wanting this stupid week to go by faster so i can talk to him again  
feeling sick    not sure if i'll go in to work tomorrow    and worrying about him  
can i have that men's hand book now? please?
i always get the best sleep after talking to him~ love

"i miss him   want him to get better too~  love  otherwise, i'll eat his whoppers~"
this weekend should be great~ gonna spend a lot of time with my second mom and him~ love 
eww   tomorrow i become a year older    -_- another day of nothing fun   yay  
happiness? i'm still trying to understand what exactly that is  
i love my 'chosen' family   it may be small and rather spread out   but i wouldn't trade them for the world 
when i finally break   will anyone be willing to put me back together?
