life is grand but can be a pain more often then it is pleasent so always remember u got to move forward in life and not hold onto the past no matter how important the past seems
"u know i figured something out today while in school u can't every be truly happy till u can learn to laugh at yourself and your own mistakes and if u just hold up all emotions inside then y bother being yourself just become some fricken emo kid(emo kids r cool i don't mean offence lol\ well i'll stop talking now comment and tell me wat u think it means to be truly happy later ppl"""
