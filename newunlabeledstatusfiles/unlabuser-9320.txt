hitting up the super smash brother brawl tourney later today  6pm in the student union  going to show people what a good toon link looks like  i need a cheer leading squad  playful 
47 people for the brawl tourney  single eliminations  fatal won  really didn't matter where you end off in the tournament one of the two best players could have eliminate one another in the first round  there should be a different way to do it  would be nice to see how people were actually ranked  other than that i gotten really far lost to the guy who made it to the finals and our match was super close 
"it was hilarious watching one person get up screaming, cheering and running around the student union while everyone else had no reaction and just stayed in their seats  lmao and also why are people so judgmental about the halftime show  you know they aren't going to sound as good as their original song unless they were lip syncing  not many artist can perform and sing well "
