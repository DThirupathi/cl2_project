"in fairytales it's always a happy ending, but whatever happened to real life problems like poverty, drugs, anything and everything? why did all the endings in movies eventually turn out good? it doesn't always happen like that  there is always a flaw in the plans, always a little tweaking needing to be done, death is the concequence and sometimes it's fixed before disaster strikes  but not often "
"today is a winding road  it's taken me to places that i didn't want to go  today, in the blink of an eye, i'm holding onto something and i do not know why, but i tried  i tried to read between the lines, i tried to look in your eyes  i want a simple e playful laination of what you're feeling inside  i've gotta find a way out  maybe there's a way out "
