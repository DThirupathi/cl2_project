"god  this feeling is crapily amazing  everytime i got to these waking down meetings i feel so alive and aware (which is kinda the point, i guess), but my brain always feels like someone tried to melt it"

"shit   after the shit i have heard this week i want to strangle 1 4 of my friends, another 1 4 needs to be slapped, 1 4 of you guys the jury is still out on    and for the remainder, i love you guys "
"another day of e playful ecting things to happen, hoping i'll get some things sorted   and yet here i am, these negative feelings bouncing around in my head, with nothing to show for it except bitter disappoint  why do i keep doing this e playful ecting things to change  why do e playful ect you to notice i hard i try at keeping this sinking ship afloat? fuck   "
"i must appoligize for my harsh ranting, last night  i allowed myself to be pulled into a train of thought that stemed from my anger at my own inaction  i plan to resolve this tonight, as i had hoped to last night  anyone that would like to talk to me about this, plz do so tomorrow, because if i want to talk about it tonight, i will call you "
"you and i wake up in a psychiatric <propmale> together  using 4 words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status, so i may comment on yours as well   be a good sport and play along    4 words iss harder than you think      !"

"i'm confused   someone help me out here  i posted my feeling on facebook, granted they revolve around another person  they are upset that i posted this here, saying that i had no right, that it was too personal for them  someone help me out here and connect the dots for me"
a 15 year old girl holds her 1 year old son; people call her a slut  but no one knows she was raped at 13  people call a girl fat; no one knows she has a serious disease that causes her to be overweight  people call an old man ugly; no one knows he had a serious injury to his face while serving our country in vietnam  re-post this if your against bullying and stereotyping!!!! i bet none of you will post this   
just realized that i am still struggling with my thoughts and emotions revolving around certain issues  i am concerned that am losing my resolve that i need to do this  is it bad that i just want this to be over and try to move on with my life?
"damn, what a full day  riddled with joy and sadness, hope and despair, concern and compassion  tomorrow promises many more challenges  i hope this love that i feel will <propfemale> me through again "
"i agreed to meet with someone to talk about our issues, but rather than resolve them it has put off and it seems that the other person is entering the same patterns that got us here in the first place  i know that to be compassionate and show this person that i do care is the thing i should do, but at some point you have to say enough "
helped mom move some stuff  got the my wet stuff out of the basement  almost everything is ready to be moved  today was a good day  sounds like there is more to be coming my way soon
