"my boy turns 13 on sunday and i'm just sitting here looking at my profile picture and thinking about how thankful i am for his life   first we were told we'd never have children of our own, then judah almost died at birth and the doctor told us he'd never leave the hospital alive, and now he's turning 13 on me   his life is such a gift from god "
"so caeden just told me that snapping turtles live in the jungle, and they're orange and they eat cookies   he said he learned that on <propfemale> "

and tonight caeden told me he was thankful for   his brain!  my word 
total dumb & dumber moment happened at my house tonight   came home to find the ice cream scoop still inside the ice cream container in the freezer   so before i put it in the sink i did what any normal person would do   i licked it!  my bottom lip froze to the scooper!!  had to use the sink sprayer to run warm water over my lip to get it off!
sure is hard to make this rum cake for the staff christmas dinner when judah leaves his turtle swimming around in my sink!
"spent the morning visiting <propfirst> <propmale>'s home, monticello   when we were leaving caeden said he really liked his visit to \uncle jello's house\""!"""
why is it that my sons never get along better than when they're trying to kill each other with nerf guns???
"my <propmale> is amazing   last round of allergy testing today and he got 74 shots in one arm   and then what do you suppose he chooses to do with his evening after he gets home?  go with me to the base and help with dinner clean-up!  i mean seriously, is this child an angel????"
"although i'm certain i have the most awesome teenager on the planet, there are times he still baffles me entirely   like just now i walked into the living room to see his big teenage feet propped up on the recliner, one sock on and one sock off   when i asked him why he only had one sock on he just said, \i just didn't feel like putting the other one on \""  okay """
"watching a movie with the boys tonight and caed just wouldn't stop talking   i finally told him he wasn't allowed to talk anymore during the movie   he looked agitated and finally said, \if i burp or toot am i still allowed to say excuse me?\"""""
"caeden's favorite thing in the world to eat is a turkey & cheese roll-up   at lunch today, <propmale> asked him, \why do you like turkey & cheese roll-ups so much?\""  \",5c9f84f0a5ad4b3240846c965fdd0e4f,"and furthermore   i was feeling really crummy after all that testing this evening and left caeden's laundry on his floor   <propfirst> went in to tell caed goodnight and found him putting his own laundry away!  he'd folded his pants, put everything in it's proper drawer and even <propmale> his shirts in his closet!  the child is four!  i take no credit for this, he is simply a gift from god!"
listening to <propfirst> putting caeden to bed and they are singing at the top of their lungs a little song that i wrote    so special!  now my day is complete!
"well, we built an igloo and it was so fun!!!  but then it collapsed with <propfirst> and judah inside!  bummer, since it was hours of work, but still funny at the same time watching them emerge from under the snow blocks!"
"happy 11th birthday to our <propmale> jaron   i love your devotion to those you love, your quick sense of humor, and your passion for all things fun   i've never wanted to hug or strangle anyone more than you!  maybe that's why you're my favorite!  smile   i love you, my <propmale>, and i'm so proud to be your mama   you are a gift to our family "
played laser tag on my fractured heel tonight   just couldn't help myself!
"just thinking tonight about the miracle of adoption and so grateful that god is allowing us to be a part of this miracle, and also so grateful for the mother he chose for me   i am so blessed by the family he put me in and i had to change my profile picture to a photo of me and my mama to celebrate the awesome and life-changing gift of adoption   i am utterly and ridiculously blessed "
so great to have my judah home from filming today   we had tea and talked and talked and played blokus and i whooped him soundly   it's back to the grindstone for him tomorrow    and <propfirst> and <propmale> get to go ice fishing!  it's been <propmale>'s dream since we moved here five years ago   i'm so excited for him!  here's hoping for fish for dinner!

"hello every-one, how are you all?"
"so it seems my <propmale> was accidentally using my facebook login to do all his facebooking today!  i have no idea what was said over facebook using my name today, so if i sounded like an 11 year old to any of you   just wanted you to know, i was!"
"at dinner a moment ago caeden looked down at his plate of moroccan lemon chicken and said with his grouchiest voice, \i'm too whiny to eat this \"""""
