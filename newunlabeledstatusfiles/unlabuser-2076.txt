i feel really stupid being on here 
finally done with those pictures 
i have a mohawk  hahaha
so pissed off 
why am i so freakin tired all the time?
someone just inspired me 
i guess i can do this too  like it and i'll tell you why i like you 
a picture is worth a thousand words   you never quite realize how true that is until you go through a million pictures of your life and realize that every single one has a story to itself 
but those who trust in the lord will find new strength  they will soar high on wings like eagles  they will run and not grow weary  they will walk and not faint  -<propmale> 40 smile 1
"it's funny how people change, but there's always that hint of a person you once knew still left in who they are "
"why are you looking, for love? why are you still searching, as if i'm not enough?\words never made more sense to me, or seemed to present a more clear message  we all strive to be what someone else wants, but in all reallity, we already are  we're what christ wants, more than anything, and i think if we all would just realize that, there wouldn't be as much pain  maybe that's the real problem in this world "
"i know you're not all christians, but i want you to take a minute, and just think about it  even if you don't believe that christ was the savior, he gave his life for you  he gave his life for people he doesn't even know  that takes alot of love, and i think we should all strive to be that way "
sometimes i just need to chill 
"had the weirdest, scariest, yet most awesome and exciting e playful erience of my life at 1 in the morning last night "
figuring yourself out is one hard thing to do 
just got back from playing soccer with my brother  my head hurts 
4th of july church service was tighttttttttttttttttt 
"i'll show them, i'm willing to fight  and give them, the best of my life "
time for change 
"this has easily been the hardest thing i've had to do in my life  but, it only gets harder from here "
"in the first 6 days, i've learned that i have often taken my friends for granted, and i apologize to each and every one of you for that "
"there is no such thing as \i can't \"" there is only \""i won't \"""""
"if i could do it all again, i'd go back and change everything but, time won't let me go"
i am so homesick now for someone that i never knew  i am so homesick now for someplace i'll never be 
"letting go of things i shouldn't have felt in the first place was the hardest thing i've ever had to do, but now that i have, i'm free as an eagle "
"if you gave me back all those years, i'd do it all better i swear "
it happens in a blink  it happens in a flash  it happens in the time it took to look back 
"you can't stop me now  i've got a fire in my eyes and a burning in my heart, and i'm not backing down "
"finding nemo, the only movie i'll never be too old for "
"use my hands, use my feet, to make your kingdom come  to the corners of the earth, until your work is done "
"whatever disease this is that i've been stricken with, it sucks "
"go ahead, you're never gonna take me  you can bend but you're never gonna break me  i was yours , i'm not yours anymore  oh, you don't own me "
"go ahead, put a target on my forehead  you can fire but you've got no bullet  i was yours but i'm not yours anymore  oh, you don't own me "
finally back from ohio 
"in order to stop me, you have to break me  in order to break me, you have to kill me  in order to kill me, you have to prove that my god doesn't exist  and that is something you can't do  so therefore, you shouldn't waste your time trying to stop me "
"i realize now, the absolute hardest thing to do in life, is find something that keeps pushing you and makes you strive to do better  that's why i'm thankful each and everyday for my god, my savior, my family, and my friends "
"it really just hit me  this is my last year of high school  and some of these people i may never see again  guess it's time to really start living it up, huh?"
"1st- fitness mgt; lynch, 2nd- eng sp topics; thompson, 3rd- web design; stinson, 4th-soc psych; bode, 5th- physical fitness; donnelly\tell me if we have any classes together, which, for some reason, i doubt i have classes with any of you "
"it's funny how the words of a child can be, simple, though the thought there is so meaningful  it makes me wonder what i would say to me, in the eyes of another "
the greatest comics to ever exist; <propmale> and hobbes 
headin out to the field early  anyone wanna meet me out there and get some extra practice in?
the guardian; the movie that inspires me to save lives 
"can you lay your life down, so a stranger can live? can you take what you need, but take less than you give? could you close everyday, without the <propfemale> and fame? could you hold your head high, when no one knows your name? that's how legends are made, at least that's what they say "
"it's the little things in life that make the real difference  it's that simple text message that says you still care, that simple e-mail that says you're still there, that simple acknowledgment that i'm here  it's the smallest things that say 'i love you' that mean the most "
"one tear in the dropping rain, one voice in a sea of pain  could the maker of the stars, hear the sound of my breaking heart? one light, is all i am  right now, i can barely stand  if you're everything you say you are, could you come close, and hold my heart?"
can't believe i'm playing pandemic  i have no life 
what i don't understand  why chicks hangout and leave comments on each other's facebook at the same time?
"one tear, in the dropping rain  one voice, in a sea of pain  could the maker of the stars, hear the sound of my breaking heart? one light, is all i am  right now, i can barely stand  if you're everything you say you are, could you, come close, and hold my heart?"
"i finally figured out, the hardest part of someone giving you a second <propmale>, is accepting that they gave it to you, and giving yourself that second <propmale> "
"i just came to another realization  why do we love some people, and hate others? why do we give to some, and take from others? why do we protect some, and hurt others? we're all god's children  we're all siblings in the eyes of god  so in hurting each other, we're destroying our family  why? what's it all for? to me, the only logical thing to do now, is to love, give, and protect "
everything has never been so right 
"the times that you feel like you're falling from grace  the times you're hurting  the times that you heal  the times you go hungry, and are tempted to steal  the times of confusion, in chaos and pain  i'm there in your sorrow, under the weight of your shame  i'm there through your heartache "
"i'm there in the storm  my love i will keep you, by my pow'r alone  i don't care where you fall, where you have been  i'll never forsake you, my love never ends  it never ends \\",2a6d3c310b79ffd72e922edfb163bab2,guess i'm not going to sleep  lol
"i hate when girls say, 'i'm ugly' or, 'i'm not good enough ' because it's not what is seen on the outside that makes you beautiful, it's what's on the inside, and when you find a guy who understands that, then you won't have to worry about being 'ugly' or 'not good enough '"
"can you lay your life down, so a stranger can live? can you take what you need, but take less than you give? could you close everyday, without the <propfemale> and fame? could you hold your head high, when no one knows your name? that's how legends are made, at least that's what they say "
so others may live 
"my best friend and her sister are two of the funniest and greatest people i've ever met  oh, the memories  haha"
i feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders 
tryin to get inspired to write some concert material  aghhhh why is this so difficult?
"just a liar and a thief, the word tells us so  we'd like to let him know where he can go  to hell with the devil!!"
i'm never getting to sleep at this rate 
thank you to everyone who was there for me tonight  thank you for everyone who was there for me before tonight  thank you for everyone who sticks with me through everything  thank you for my best friends and my family  thank you god for this life you've blessed me with 
"at the end of this, i may end up with nothing, but i'll always have the satisfaction of knowing i fought for what i believed in;  the strength to fight for what i want; and the love to fight for those who believed in me "
"fight me  again and again  knock me down  again and again  push, pull, batter, bruise  again  again  again  but no matter how much you hurt me, i'll never back down  i've got god on my side, and with him, i will never stay on the ground  so go ahead and push me again "
i have a feeling that today is going to be a very good day 
you know life is good when you dance around aimlessly without a care in the world to video game music  haha
"senior year starts tomorrow, and my older brother added a little extra touch to it by punching my in the head  haha"
let the music speak for itself 
"i realized now (thanks to <propfemale> waller) that even if i never end up finding whatever it is that seems to make everyone else so happy, i'll be perfectly content because i've got god on my side, and i seem to be good at making people feel good about themselves  and that, in turn, makes me happier than anything "
"when i don't measure up to much in this life, well i'm a treasure, in the arms of christ  cuz i'm forgiven "
"tie game  3-3  finally got to play, made those j-town clowns feel it "
prp soccer = champions  that's where it's at 
"i wish you could see, i really just don't have much fight left anymore  i've fought for too long, and it's finally caught up to me "
"i hate the feeling of not being important  i hate the feeling of being alone, and the feeling of being pushed away  i hate it, and i don't know how it happened "
life just feels good   smile 
"isn't everyone, pretending they're alright? isn't everyone, about to fall?"
i love punkin out the opposing soccer players  they're all such little girls  haha  won the game today  3-0 
i'm fighting a losing battle 
"i'm fighting as hard as i can, and i'll never stop until you tell me to "
"seriously, now that i think about it, life's pretty good  i couldn't ask for a better family or better friends  i couldn't ask for better teammates either  or for that matter, i couldn't ask for anything better  thankful for what i have, forever "
"there he goes - a hero  a savior to the world  here he stands, with scars in his hands  with love, he gave, his life so we could be free  the savior of the world   smile "
"some of the blessings and wonders of life: best friends, family, food, water, air, sports, clarity, and the ability to do good in the world "
worrying and praying for my best friend  hope you feel better soon 
"we spend so much of our lives not saying what we want to say, what we should say  we speak in codes, secret messages  origami  so why can't we just say it plainly, i love you?"
"sometimes, in life, you have to give up the things that are important to you, to keep the ones that are important to you  sometimes we forget that, and lose the ones we love  it's hard to <propmale> both your dreams and your friends  so never forget that in chasing your dreams, you should never let go of your friends "
one is loved because one is loved  no reason is needed for loving 
"and when i feel like i don't measure up, to much in this life, well, i'm a treasure, in the arms of christ "
national suicide prevention week
"there will be a day, with no more tears  no more pain  no more fears  there will be a day, when the presence of this place, will be no more  we'll see jesus face to face "
just praying  that's all i can really do 
butler game tomorrow  it's about to be a throwdown 
"i'm fallin' apart, barely breathing  with a broken heart, that's still beating  in the pain, there is healing  in your name, i find meaning "
well i guess  truth is   
"truth is, my best friend is one-of-a-kind   smile "
"truth is, my best friend is still one-of-a-kind   smile \also, the other truth is; i can unleash the beast "
"i've heard so many times; things change  well yeah, things change  but in order for it to be a good change, you have to make it that way  stop letting things get worse "
"truth is, the things that get said at my lunch table between me, <propmale>, <propfemale>, <propfemale>, <propfemale>, and <propfemale>, are some of the funniest things i've ever heard "
"i hate wanting to talk to someone about something, but then when i start to, i can't "
"i just want everyone to know, my best friend is the best, and none of yours even compare "
"truth is, i hope i'm enough for you "
sometimes life is a struggle  that's when you have to learn to put your faith in god 
water you turned into wine  opened the eyes of the blind  there's no one like you  none like you  into the darkness you shine  out of the ashes we rise  there's no one like you  none like you 
"i need you like a hurricane; thunder crashin', wind and rain; to tear my walls down  i'm only yours now  i need you like a burnin' flame; a wildfire untamed; to burn these walls down, i'm only yours now "
"the problem with you believing that you don't show me enough appreciation for the things i do, is that seeing you smile is enough for me, and the happiness i get from making you feel better, is more than any amount of appreciation "
"one tear in a dropping rain, one voice in a sea of pain, could the maker of the stars, hear the sound of my breaking heart? one light, is all i am, right now, i can barely stand, if you're everything you say you are, would you come close, and hold my heart?"
it's hard to look back and imagine how much better things would be if you were still here 
another saturday of training  this'll be fun

"anyone i talked to about the ultimate frisbee game, it's cancelled  someone be sure to inform <propfirst> fox "
"number one, i'll be the best in the world, 2nd to none "
"it's never enough, it's never enough, no matter what i say  it's never enough, no it's never enough, no matter who i try to be   i'll never be what you want me to be "
"why don't we all just grow up a little bit, and stop playing with each other's feelings? we're seniors here, about to be on our own, and time isn't slowing down  so let's grow up a little bit, huh?"
"it seems like in one day, it was gone  it seems like everything i tried to be, no longer mattered  no matter what i did, i guess now it isn't enough  like i was just a temporary fix  whatever, for real  i'm sick of being walked on  step on me again, see what happens "
"what was the start of all this? when did the cogs of fate begin to turn?\perhaps it is impossible to grasp that answer now, from deep within the flow of time   \but, for a certainty, back then, we loved so many, yet hated so much, we hurt others and were hurt ourselves \yet even then, we ran like the wind, whilst our laughter echoed, under cerulean skies   "
"you're all that i hoped i'd find, in every single way  and everything i could give, is everything you couldn't take  cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand <propmale> away, and the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay  cause i know i'm good for something, i just haven't found it yet, but i need it   "
"the book of <propmale> is, hands down, the best movie i've ever seen in my entire life "
"don't worry about the past, because what's done is done  don't worry about the future, because whatever happens happens  live in every moment, and commit yourself to loving and giving, and commit yourself to god's plan for you "
"would you lay your life down, so a stranger can live? would take what you need, but take less than you give? could you close everyday, without the <propfemale> and fame? could you hold your head high, when no one knows your name?"
i've got the best friends in the world 
"stop complaining about how life's so hard  stop complaining about how things never work out  if you're so friggin upset about it, get up and fix it "
hoping everything goes well for my best friend   smile 
i gave you my all and you threw it in my face 
"cause i'll be by your side, wherever you fall  in the dead of night, whenever you call  and please don't fight, these hands that are holding you  yeah, my hands are holding you "
ag2g  i like that 
"it's not a race, it's not a competition  it's not a game, and it's not a sprint  it's a marathon, and i'll keep running until i cross the line "
giving my all to someone who deserves my all  hope everything works the way i want it to 
texting <propfemale> eisenbeis helps me stay positive  wish i knew more people like her 
"i'd like to thank the friends of mine who have never turned their backs on me and have always stayed by my side; <propfemale> <propfemale> sims, <propfemale> stratton, <propfirst> phelps, <propfemale> <propfemale> keltner, <propfemale> eisenbeis, and life church louisville  thanks to all of you  i love each and everyone of you "
the best part of my life is definitely christ  and being able to love my best friends  being given a <propmale> to do that is better than anything in the world 
my favorite song of all time; by your side - tenth avenue north
"at the cross you, beckon me  you draw me gently, to my knees and i am, lost for words, so lost in love  i'm sweetly broken, wholly surrendered "

"i'm glad i'm saved  i'm glad i let god come into my life  the best decision of my life  and no matter how much 'logic' someone throws at me, it won't push me from god "
"when it's all said and done, no one remembers, how far we have run  the only thing that matters, is how we have loved "
just applied to asbury   smile

"<propfemale> sims, <propfemale> stratton, <propfemale> keltner, and <propfirst> phelps are the 4 best friends in the world  couldn't ask for better "
"maybe i'm not the fastest  maybe i'm not the strongest  maybe i'm the funniest, nicest, or the kindest person around  but, truth is, i try, and i've got a bigger heart than anyone in the world, and one day i will be the fastest, the strongest, the funniest, the nicest, and the kindest person "
"i've been away for so long that i'm lost  i don't know where i am, and i need the direction  i can't see around me, and i need the light  i need the love  good thing you never hesitate to love me, no matter how much i mess up  if he accepts me, and loves me, i can guarantee he'll accept and love you, too  praise to god "
soooo        i guess i'm just wondering what's going on????
"oh the excitement of today  i almost took off my own head with a boomerang, my little brother almost took out my eyes with that boomerang, and my cat just attacked the chair i'm sitting in  what's next?"
"sometimes, i think about how thankful i am for my friends, and i think about how much they love me  and then, i think about christ, and how much he loves me, and how thankful i am for him  i'm blessed, and i realize that now  i hope one day, everyone will know the love i know "
"and as he stands in victory, sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  for i am his, and he is mine, bought with the precious blood of christ "

"you are more than the choices that you've made  you are more than the sum of your past mistakes  you are more than the problems you create  you've been remade  'cause this is not about what you've done, but what's been done for you  this is not about where you've been, but where your brokenness brings you to  this is not about what you feel  but what he felt to forgive you, and what he felt to make you loved   love "
"and as he stands, in victory, sin's curse has lost, it's grip on me  for i am his, and he is mine, bought with the precious blood, of christ "
