"is now to the point where he doesn't care, once he leaves jenkins, he's not gunna care that he's leavin' people behind  he knows that those people are probably a dime a dozen at college and worth far more  he can talk to those that wants to and cares to keep in touch, but he's not going to force anyone to or go out of his way to "
"wished he had someone to talk to, sadly he knows not who to talk to, nor what to talk about "
"really wishes things could be <propfemale> much easier, he's tired of this b s  and tired of causing pain for those that care about him  and tired of having pain caused by those he cares about "
"feels his grip on this reality slipping, then tightning just to slip again  he's afraid eventually it will be his sanity that goes, or his life "
"feels his psychicness is going to be his downfall  he predicted something would happen, he tried his best to avoid it, sadly as he knew, it only make things worse, so he backed off and things were okay, but lately things have been getting worse, and he feels the times coming and he's not wanting to be there when it arrives  "
"wished that something good would finally happen  it could be people could stop: pissing me off, disappointing me, making me feel more of an outcast than i am, also wished these (bleeps replacings adjective) electronics would stop (more bleeps) messing up "
"has lost his mind, if found you can return it to him, there isn't a reward being offered and its not worth much, but if your bored and you find it, you can always return it"
"has a webpage project to do, no idea when its due, but he wont have much time in class because he agreed to help anyone who needs it and people has been takin' him up on that, he doesn't mind, its just the teacher is allowin' him to choose what he wants to do on his whereas the others aren't that lucky, so he chose to do it on <propfirst> twain, the wright brothers and <propfirst> ford "
"has finally figured out how his mind works, for the most part, and he knows why he feels the way he does, it took nearly 3 years for him to collect all of the pieces but he finally understands, more or less, sadly he cannot simply fix his problem, not by himself for it was not caused by himself; therefore,he must try to do the scenes in his head that he's seen countless times  he hopes if he does this, it will help "
"will be back hopefully soon but since this involves his sister, it may be never"
"hates the massive pool of shattered material and mixed substances called his mind  hates the thoughts that plaque him mainly because the fact that they can never happen, not necessarily because he doesn't want them too but anyway "
"hates this  this being that he's already a senior, he's been at jenkins for 3 years, and its already time to leave; he also hates how everyone has changed and moved apart, hates how things are becoming  wished there was away to turn back the clock so he could relive the past "
"will be back soon, will be on the computer tonight "
"feels left out of alot of things  feels this large loop of people just likes shutting him out, he makes (and others inside the loop makes) attempts that usually end in him being farther out of the loop in the end  feels like he's stuck between worlds, (not literally worlds, but figuritively)"
"knows alot of people are ready for school to end, and the seniors cant wait to get out early, but he can wait, and truthfully, he doesnt want to be told he cant come to school to spend the last week of his last year at jenkins high with his friends  he doesnt want to say his goodbyes so early (even though they are on facebook, since its not the same as being with them in person)"

"doesn't feel good, he hasn't really felt good for a long time,  so he's going to go lay down and stuff "
"knows that we all try to help everyone we can, so that in the end the ones we truly helped, was really ourselves "
"is worried he is actually going to lose what sense he has  since he can't seem to get enough sleep for his mind stays busy, thinking about his newest friends, among all of the other things that cloud his mind  he knows at this rate, insanity or death, is only a few blocks away  "

"knows that people are considered family commonly based on either blood relations or legality (marriage, adoption, etc ) however, he know's these are just the commonly accepted means by which people are family, but are not the only ways  someone can be considered your family if you and they accept this, are unofficially adopted by you or your family, or simply saw as and treated as family "
"needs a serious distraction from things to help keep him from going any crazier, trying to build (rather help build) an actual working video communicator wrist watch, might prove to be a small but well needed distraction"
"was feeling somewhat guilty and annoyed, but now he feels hot, tired, and relieved his dad didnt buy peacocks, he got ginnies instead, either way, he never seen a young peacock or <propfemale> before, so he wasnt sure "

"knows he needs an emotional release, but whenever one tries forcing itself on him, he fights to control and suppress it; whenever he causes one himself, generally not purposely, he again fights for control and suppresses it  true he knows this is not good nor safe, yet he does it anyway  but what can he do, allow himself to circum to thoughts that will never become a reality "
"was pushed beyond his ability to control his emotions by the loss of a small life, a life that should not have been lost, but because of a series of events, some unfortunate, it was  causing an une playful ected emotional response, one that proved too much to handle  this small life known to him only for a short while had a far greater impact than he ever e playful ected possible "

swears the world's out to torture him  including here on facebook 
thanks everyone
"is questioning if there is enough left here for him to make carrying all of this weight worth it  so far he's doubting it, the future he sees isn't one that seems worth waiting for  maybe this is just a period that will pass if not then my dad's prediction of a demise around age 30 maybe a few years off   "
