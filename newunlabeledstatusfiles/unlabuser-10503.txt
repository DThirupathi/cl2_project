life is to short to wear boring socks
"well    my baby sisters getting married, and moving away  sad  who wants to live in utah anyway  sad "
                         
"microsoft should not have put rename 1 below delete, this gets me into trouble"
"i want to camping, and make a huge bonfire and drink beer around it while eating hotdogs and other various meat products               "
i think that the garbage trucks are loud on purpose   
proud to be a white belt    
"i will never, never eat anything with msg in it again     so sick"
"going to move to a town thats right for me   got to keep me moving, keep me moving with some energy   well i talk about it, talk about, talk about, talk about it    talk about, talk about, talk about moving    gotta move on   gotta move on   "

enjoys <propfemale> haw
what is a seether   and why can't i fight it?
i'm becoming a knitting junkie     i wonder if they have a 12 stitch program for that 
maybie if i close my eyes and wish real hard it will all go away   
"thinks that no one should die because they cannot afford health care and no one should go broke because they get sick  if you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day"
your going to need a bigger boat       
"i keep pushing the house button up there, but i'm still at work  i dont think that button works "
people with super bleached teath look silly     
"i hate when the cornflakes on top deflect the milk into a white shower all over the table, does this happen to anyone else?"
is addicted to knitting  i wonder if they have a 12 stitch program for that 
it's never easy to say goodbye   
hi
its an <propmale> day
10 years of wedded bliss today  i love you <propmale>  love @jim
everyone is looking for something and they assume somebody else knows what it is no one can live with the decisions of their own it seems so they look to someone else to tell 'em what to be tell 'em what to wear tell 'em what to say tell 'em how to act and think and compel others compulsively until the world is all like them
