please pray for me today to have the strength to have my little dog put to sleep  his name is spanky he has cancer and we were up all night with him he can hardly breathe  and i don't know if i have the strength to end his suffering 
so happy spanky got to come back home today!!! he got new medicine and he feels better  the vet said it won't work for long but at least we'l have him a little longer
