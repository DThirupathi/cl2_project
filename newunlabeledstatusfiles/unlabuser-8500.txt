well today was not my best day ever   my work truck caught on fire while i was driving it and i had to watch the fire dept  put the fire out because 3 fire extinguisers wernt enough   then i got to wait for almost 4 hours for a tow truck and a rental truck so i could finish my day   i should have called in sick   sigh 
it took me 4 hours and 15 minutes to get home from work today   this city needs to get its shit together with how to handle a snow storm   the only road that had been plowed on my way home was wornall rd and only from 85th st south     freekin hell 
home from work today due to an accident at work yesterday   i slipped and fell on the ice    sigh    hurt my back   this sucks!
had a tooth pulled today   yikes i forgot how much it hurts   thankfully i have a very understanding gf who understands the healing power of chinese food  hot and sour soup!
there is constant construction noise now coming from down the street   it's supposed to last till winter   freakin hell itll be peaceful around here!  sigh 
if you ain't got problems i feel for bad for you son   i got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one   99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
"sick for days, so many ways\i'm achin' now, achin' now\it's times like these i need relief\please show me how, oh show me how\to get right, yeah it's outta sight  ~the black keys"
"it's difficult for me to share real feelings on this faceless facebook   it's easier when theres something i'm angry about or annoyed but today i'm truely sad   i got home from work to find that <propmale>, the rott i inherited from my dad and one of my best friends for the last 2 years and 9 months couldn't even walk by himself "
