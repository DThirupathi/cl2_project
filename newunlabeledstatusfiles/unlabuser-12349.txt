vicodin so far does nothing for my pain nor anything else 
the vicodin is finally starting to make some of my pain go away   smile 
i am going to try and eat dinner  the numbness is almost gone  i feel confident i can eat with biting my tongue off now  but i want real food  i am not the type of person that can be satisfied by only eating ice cream

"1\ out of every 10 people born is gay  that means 1 out of every 10 people\ is instantly put down, given bad labels, left alone, put in a minority \and so much more, all for something they didn't ask for  many gay teens \are committing suicide as a way of escaping  if you want to tell them \life will get better and you respect them for who they are, copy and paste this most of you won't, but let's see the 5% of you ?"
i am so happy i reconnected with my friends from safe homes!!!!!!!  smile 
lots of crap to do 
i am so pissed 
"my smoke detector on the 15-18' cathedral ceiling in my bedroom has decided to start  beeping  i think it needs a new battery  not an easy fix with the tall ladder being in the barn, i think i have to sleep through it  tonight is not the night with psat's tomorrow   sad "
good meeting today  smile 
in a good mood
have to do a ton of things today for my dad and i don't feel good 
my dad threw my step mother out  he said shes not allowed back and if she comes i can't let her inside or else 
"so my dad let my step mother back inside the house after i went to sleep  thank god, without her i don't have a security blanket to stabilize my father "

"i had another bad day  i shed a few tears  in the end i gained more fear  however \i know have someone in the same boat as me  my step mother is getting ready to bounce about the same time as me  we both are trying to flee as soon as my 17th birthday passes and for her christmas passes "
i am pissed i could not go to safe homes  i hope mr  milko is okay 
sometimes i don't know what i do wrong  i get worried if i did something wrong or if i was misinterpreted  i feel like i don't know anything 
i'm in a very good mood 
i am confused 
"its what you know that haunts you,\not what you don't \if you knew not what you know,\this world would be a different place "
<propfirst> is re-friending me on facebook!  smile  kinda silly for a post but like i was hatting not being friends with him since we were like brothers before 
i am actually in a relatively good mood today  i don't feel like the world is after me as much as usual 
i have decided i am founding crackbooks anonymous for facebook addicts  there are people out there like me who need serious help from the twelve step method of staying facebook sober 
"argh, why cannot i not focus on anything  *feel happyish [x] *take adderall to focus more [x] *have work out [x] *feel committed to accomplishing work [x] *actually get anything done [ ]"
i sometimes feel like i am frankenstein because of my personality differences and life choices and life views are all different and too a lot of people contradicting  i conform to being a non-conformist 
"sorry to anyone who tried talking to me earlier today  i fell asleep with my facebook logged in  i was trying to check my facebook last night but i fell asleep, with my glasses on "
ebevryone read this this might be one of those days my dad is about to cut the internet and phone

"my father continues to impose psychological control over me through the domain of emotional and mental abuse  i have decided that i will no longer speak to him no matter where that leads me  i will peacefully practice passive resistance  he will be filing a chins on me tomorrow even though i have done nothing wrong  in reality, the m g l  defines a chins worthy \stubborn child\"" as    to be continued in a note"""
"my dad has begun taking random things away from me starting with my remote controls  luckily, i know how to do things old school and actually use the buttons on the device "
"so,\ the silent treatment appears to have worked with my father somewhat  he\ gave me back the internet and my remote controls, even though i said \nothing too him  so i responded to him when he said 'i love you', which he \then started arguing again  however the night has finished locked in an \armistice and i have my inteternet is on so things are okay  i shall no \longer give into things that are lies "

"okay, so i am just beginning to check my facebook now, i am a week and a half behind  thank you for my birthday messages, if i haven't commented on yours yet  if you sent me something and i haven't responded it is because <propmale> is here and i am spending time with him  love "
"in case you did not know what happened to me over the past week, i got into a car crash on route 68 in hubbardston, the day before my birthday  the passenger airbag did not go off and i spent the week in a hospital  i am okay though, talk to you all soon  with my wonderful man right now  love  "

4 weeks of unchecked email in my inbox here i come!
my phone service is back on so everything has cooled down 
"it's said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship  these types of friends pick up like they spoke just yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live  and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy, but you will always love them    you know who you are  smile  re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends  ?"
"bedtime for me>>>goodnight to everyone  almost tempted to stay up to talk to <propfemale> may sellars though, because we haven't talked in awhile  p s  <propfemale> i think i am going to actually call you tomorrow (later today) instead of talking late at night as usual   playful "
"that's odd    the group home i was at friend requested me on my family facebook  i think i may decline, i'd rather not have dcf snooping into my personal life  i mean that would be like befriending a lipton center crisis responder      considering my dcf file claims and literally believes me to be a crack-smoking, delusional juvenile delinquent who has <propmale> authority problems, i will be adding them to my block list "
"well this crack smoker has got a bed to go sleep in   wink  hopefully the bed doesn't try to suffocate me like last night, while it speaks to me through my mind  maybe i should share some of my crack with it next time i get some to get on its nice side           playful "
i am very frustrated  i need to find some to live with  my only requirements are: 1  i can still go to ncces  2  the person(s) must not have bipolar  any ideas?

"this also means more old photos, baby stuff, etc! i cannot believe i am able to legitimitably say this, but, i had formulated the base of my political ideology in the 3rd grade  at this point in time i guess i would be labelled as a libertarian-9-year-old  i cannot believe how well the old project i found correlates to the thing i wrote in my facebooks political view section "
my father is missing  my step-mother is in the process of filling a missing persons report

"i have not been able to focus on anything all day  i prioritized my work accordingly, have a neat workspace away from distractions, and the work that needs to be done is in front me, but i just cannot concentrate on anything "
"off to attempt to concentrate on school work, again  if i can't soon then i will have to pull an all nigher   sad "
"so watching humanities documentaries on auschwitz did actually get my school work concentration back  i got a project done that was super late for precalculus  now i am debating on whether to get a few hours of sleep, or to just stay up all night and get more work done   (lots more to be done)"
0 0 omg i just realized to people that have the same initials
