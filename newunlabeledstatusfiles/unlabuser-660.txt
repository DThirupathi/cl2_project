so right now my plan is to get an associate in arts & sciences with an emphasis in health & physical education transfer degree and then transfer over to wsu and get a bachelor's degree in psychology 
i have so much more schooling left to do - a lot of science and math 
so i just read the financial aid statement for cbc  according to it they only offer financial aid for up to 9 quarters  so this 2011-2012 school year will be the last year that i get financial aid  i'll have to look into getting a scholarship 
"so what i really want to be is a cps investigator, so i don't need the emphasis on health & physical education  i'll just get a regular aa and transfer and get a ba in either psychology or social work or human services "
<propfirst> can now roll from his back to his front  he was rolling all around this morning   smile 
i've got to get an academic plan done before i can get any more financial <propfemale>  i scheduled it for next wednesday  i did some computing myself and i think i'm done with my electives  so the only reason i won't be able to graduate next year is because i've been putting off math   sad 
"just reread the complete guidelines for financial <propfemale>, so the <propmale> of 9 quarters of financial <propfemale> is if you're going full time each quarter, if you're half time it's up to 18 and they allow two program changes up to 12 quarters  so i should be able to get financial <propfemale> for the rest of my schooling "
and if my calculations are correct fall 2012 will be my last quarter at cbc then i'll be able to transfer  i'll find out for sure next wednesday 
"i think my toe is either broken, sprained or dislocated  i hit it against my dumbbells 2 1 2 weeks ago and it still hasn't healed if anything it feels worst, though i'm sure <propmale> stepping on it all the time isn't helping "

"i just asked <propmale> if he would rather take dance classes or gym classes and he said \dance\"" followed by laughter  smile """
i asked <propmale> to play with <propfirst> so he started handing him all his toys - it was very cute 
"just got my first english 102 assignment done  i prefer taking english classes on campus, it's so much easier to stay focused and motivated "
"had a good day: spending time with <propfirst> and the boys, getting my homework done, having smores and getting to know <propfemale>  now it's time to go to bed  goodnight everyone!"
"got my native american history homework in right on time, however i only was able to answer 12 of 15 questions  i need to do some extra credit  i hate online classes in the summer  i have homework due everyday "
<propfirst> keeps scooting his booty down the hallway trying to get to <propmale>'s room  when i catch him he tries to scoot faster - he's so cute 
damn the fine print of wedding venues 
i got my homework done for the day  it's so much better to get it done earlier than waiting last second 
you know it's summer when the moment you step outside you feel like your getting bitten by bugs everywhere 
"just took a look at my schedule for fall - four classes, tow of which are online, what was i thinking, lol  i might have to take different classes though because <propfirst> has a new shift change coming up "

"going on a date with <propfirst> tonight  about time, lol  it'll be nice to spend time with him without the kids around "
"i wish i could sleep right now  i woke up at 6 smile 0am and cleaned non-stop til 3 surprise 0pm with <propfirst> helping out too  he did a good job! the place looks great in my opinion  now i need a nap, but i can't cause i got to keep the kids out of trouble "

made it to sacramento okay  meeting <propfirst>'s family; everyone is really nice  <propfirst> is loving all the attention he is getting from grandma <propfemale>! and <propmale> is having so much fun he doesn't want to sleep for fear that he will miss something 
"had a fun time visiting <propfirst>'s family, but happy to be home with him now  <propmale> was so happy to see all his toys and fiddlesticks  <propfirst> already miss his grandma <propfemale> "

"<propfirst> copenhaver gave me <propmale> butler annoyed movie i love: law abiding citizen\movie i like: 300\movie i hate: nothing comes to mind\\like this and i will give u an actor actress"
my poor little <propfirst> woke up at 3am with a fever and sore throat  every time he tries to drink his bottle he starts coughing 
"<propfirst> is feeling better  his fever went down, but he still has a bit of a sore throat  he won't drink his bottle right now cause of the sore throat but will eat solids, so i fed him mashed potatoes for lunch "
"i wish <propfirst>'s mom, <propfemale> was here  <propfirst> has been so fussy today and i have a huge headache now "
"i tried to move <propfirst> from <propmale>'s room back out to the living room and <propmale> got mad at me, so i'm letting them play together but i'm keeping an eye on them "
i've watched toy story 3 everyday for the past couple of days  i'm glad it's a good movie or i'd be going nuts  i'd say this is <propmale>'s favorite movie right now 
"where's <propfirst>? oh don't mind him, he's just hiding in the corner eating <propmale>'s cupcake "
"<propmale> now likes to pick out his clothes and says, \i too\"" in response to me saying i love you """
"<propfirst> had me cracking up this evening, he's so funny "
i love the sound of my kids laughter feeling the room 
i love the sound of my kids laughter feeling the room 
"<propmale> started saying please yesterday, but it comes out as peas "
"i wish my camera was charged; i'm missing out on some good photos  <propmale> and <propfirst> are playing real well together  it kind of looks like they are playing fetch, lol  <propmale> keeps throwing a ball and <propfirst> grabs it and brings it back to him  so cute "
had fun at the party  i always have fun when i see my kids having fun  and the tether ball tournament was fun too  <propmale> got spoiled! if he didn't have too many toys before he definitely has too many now  tons of left over cake if anybody wants some 
<propmale> got sad today at the gym childcare because he got put in time out for the first time  he was sobbing; i felt bad for him 
"<propfirst> clapped and said \yay\"" for the first time tonight """
"according to my mom, i need to find <propmale> some friends so he gets used to playing with kids his age  any two year olds out there looking for a playmate?"
signed <propmale> up for music classes since gym and dance didn't work out with the scheduling so hopefully the music classes work out 
<propfirst> has started crawling  <propmale> has started doing the dishes with me and saying thank you more  i'm very proud of my kids 
"just finished my homework   smile  i thought i did poorly on my last math quiz, turns out she has to grade the written answers herself and i actually got a 93% much better than the 44% i thought i had  and i just took the next quiz and got a 100%  i feel a lot better "
