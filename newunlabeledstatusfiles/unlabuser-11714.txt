"change your profile picture to your favorite cartoon character from when you were a kid or one that makes your other half happy  the goal of this game is not to see a human picture on facebook, but an invasion of childhood memories! play and pass along!"
"you\and i wake up in jail together  using only 4 words, what do you say to \me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this in your status so\i can comment on yours "
i know what you did     and i am not impressed
"to all my facebook friends !!! will you all be willing to donate your status for just a few minutes to honor a fallen <propfemale> who's just passed away while serving our country? cpl  <propmale> <propmale> (usmc) died dec 6 while serving in afghanistan  he leaves behind a wife and a newborn son named in his honor, who was born approx 24 hours after news of his death  repost to honor this hero and his family"
"something of mine went missing last week and i have waited to see if it would be returned  i do have all paperwork to prove ownership and nothing done to it will change the fact that it belongs to me  nice to see the true side of \friends\"" right before christmas    saves me money for gifts i guess """
"â€œthe reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was, the present worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will beâ€�\- <propmale> pagnol"
"â€œbe who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind â€� \-dr  seuss"
"only bc jenn said to do it    \let's see how creative my fb friends are    leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of **your first** name    it can only be 1 word    then copy and paste this to your wall so i can leave a word about you    don't just post a word & not copy, that is no fun"
