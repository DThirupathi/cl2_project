"life is filled with distractions anger blurs our dreams, fatigue hinders your mind, curiosity will get you side tracked, greed demands more, sorrow may convince you to sit on the side lines, jealousy destroy what you hold most dear      thanks for living!"
i'm reading a book on windows  playful  it starts out by telling you what a pc is     like i've never seen one before in my life  l
hmmmmmm maybe i should be more serious about things  as a whole
you must believe not all who wander are  lost
and this is why i don't talk one person says something dumb crap hits the fan everyone is mad      being anti social is way way safer
"my song of choice for the moment\full metal contact by fear factory"
watch me walk on by as you mindlessly stare at the sun i hope you learn something as the heat sinks in
"i'm sure there's a girl that's perfect for me somewhere out there understanding, honest kind  funny etc only question is will i meet her  in my lifetime"

spending my days like a feather in the wind  drifting here to there noticed by few captured by none
nothing like doing favors and getting bitched at for it
i need to find a way to unwind walmart makes me so angry
i'll  create my own imperium
if only there was a squirrel running around stabbing arrogant people ok the eyes with very hot french fries

i feel like garbage today ugh and to top it off i'm in a retail environment so anything and everything that makes migraines worse is present
oh how i love pumpkin season
i request a beak from working with or around humans
ok i demand a break from anyone who's human or had anything to do with humans

hmmmmmm what are the odds that this year will end like the last just full of women lying for no reason
a catchy tag line
"so here's a question what does milk, fruit, eggs, and vegetables have in common?"
pride comes before the fall if you can see them falling amidst they're own flames of self destruction you'll see a foolish soul who failed to learn a lesson and ignored good advise
 sad  my stress ball my sister gave me broke

as dangerous as a canon rolling around the ship
