the only reason people get lost in thought is because it's unfamiliar territory 
"life is what you make it out to be  the choices we make today, effect whats gonna happen tomorrow  so wise up, those who are living just for the ten sec  moment thats not even worth it in the end  your worse enemy is you "
"in the school liberary, waiting for <propfirst> to finish her final  i'm done with psychology class!!!!! tomorrow's another exam, and then some vacation time!!"

"it's true  throwing in the towel that fast and having kids young is not the absoultly neccecary, and there are girls out there that really dont need to be having kids cuz they are just not mature enough  but 1 2 of the girls out there like (<propfirst>) that end up preggo, do make the choice to set their lives aside, love their kids and learn to be the best mother they can be "
"it's all about realizing it's not about u anymore  yes, it's hard  yes, u miss out on alot  i agree, dont throw in the towel too fast  but, if ur young and ur mother, more power to u, and <propfirst> is living proof that life doesnt end there, and not one day has come, where she regreats her daughter "
"i'm proud of her for stepping up to the plate and doing the best she can  cuz she has done a great job all on her own! i still luv ya leysha, and i'm glad u got ur head on straight, but young mothers, is not the worst thing in the world "
