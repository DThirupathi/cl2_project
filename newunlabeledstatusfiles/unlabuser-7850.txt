in the mood for a strange dream
just woke up to snow 
take all your problems and rip 'em apart  <propfemale> them off in a shopping cart   
now the curtain opens on a portrait of today and the streets are paved with passersby and pigeons fly and papers lie waiting to blow away   
i wish there were some way to capture the images that i wake up to in the reflection of my tv set when it's off 
static electricity is giving me hell today!
"yes, indeed "
"ow, hot sauce in my eye "
"go to urbandictionary com, type in your first name, and copy paste this as your status & the definition as your first comment"
"i'm so cozy, full, happy, enamored, inspired   and i mean, it's sunset and there's       crickets on my sound machine   and i so don't wanna crawl out of my big fluffy bed right now and go work for the rest of the night   playful "
just spent the entire train ride home with a drunk russian tourist sitting across from me and taking photos of me enjoying  some delicious string cheese and minding my own business

rode a wooden escalator tonight 
"it's a completely different e playful erience watching snow from my window five stories up  there's an updraft so the wind's stirring it all around and it's just kindof lingering, floating, not falling    pretty "

lost in the white album
gettin crafty with fimo
hanging out with <propmale>  nice creative flow  listening to the beatles  all is right 
<propmale> kimbrough is exactly what i needed today 
decided that on a night like tonight it's perfectly  acceptable to take a cab 4 blocks to the train station 
i love that crazy hazy state of mind when you first wake up 
dream sweet dreams for me  dream sweet dreams for you 
trying to make peace with my flaws and grow from my mistakes
why do i feel like turbotax just ripped me off?

time to dig deep and find the strength to make it through my day tomorrow  optimism find me 
can't figure out why i'm craving coffee lately 
one day off and on call constantly in a span of 2 weeks = not okay  i'm trying to keep my head up but it's not a good feeling when your job completely takes over your life  it's my first spring in nyc and it's beautiful outside  i just want to e playful erience it  that's worth so much more than the extra money to me
