"please\put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone\who has been eaten by dragons  dragons are nearly unstoppable and they\can breathe fire  93% of people won't copy and paste this, because\theyhave been eaten by dragons or don't believe in dragons  6% of\people aresitting in the shower armed    with fire extinguishers,\whilst the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this"
"beginning to wonder if i can really do all this by myself!\ahhh!\blissful freefall, baby! i have to keep reminding myself, \there is no ground\"""""
"so\yeah, i know my mile-time has almost doubled from 8 minutes when i was\16 to almost 15 minutes now, but being passed up by people way heavier and 20+\years older than me in the 5k this morning -- ouch  my ego tripped over\it's shoelaces and fell splat on it's face  laugh  it's a good thing i had a blast at <propfirst> park & pizza with a bunch of groovy kiddos and now we're off to downtown <propfirst>!
