my hands are feeling pretty sensitive right now    anyone else?
interesting how a lot of people know a secret organization 
a provoking thought: why does this world have to have so much boundaries and divisions? what makes people deem them so necessary to isolate themselves from one another; a group from another; a family from each other? are we really all so different from each other or do we choose to think that way to the point that division is necessary?
something about the low static sound from an old record playing makes me feel at ease  probably because it reminds me of the times i used to sit out on the porch during light rainfall at my grandma's house back in hawaii
