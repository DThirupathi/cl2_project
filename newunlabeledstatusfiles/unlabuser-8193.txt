just woke up from the best night sleep i have had in probably 3 months
"nap time for ash peace, quiet, and cleaning for mom yippie"
"happy 4th of july all be safe, bring on the bbq"
"this year's 4th of july was very low key compared to what we are used to but awesome at the same time, all that couldn't make were truly missed"
ok made it past the 4th bring on labor   anytime
"17 more days i don't know if i can wait, i am kind of bored of being pregnant"
16 days
so ashlynn looked at me today and said <propfemale> is coming soon mom saturday is <propfemale>i's happy to you

according to the doc only at a 1 still on track for the 23rd 13 long days to go  smile 
ashlynn is dipping french fries in apple juice   i have decided as long as there is no mess it isn't worth the fight
i'm debating between taking a nap or cleaning   
has been having contraction every 20 minutes since 2 smile 0 yesterday afternoon  not enough to go to hospital but enough to make me miserable is hoping the doc moves the surgery date at today's appt  on the flip side really would like to be able to go to see 
a little frustrated   went through hours and hours of contractions to have nothing change at all   i am miserably pregnant next thursday it is
"5 days, 22 hrs, 01 mins, 16 secs"

"so i have a horrible fast food addiction     well today ashlynn was riding in the car with me while i was going through a <propmale> taco drive through well i ordered and pulled forward, looked at ash and said i love you, ash looks back at me and says in a very i am ordering food voice i want a quesadilla and french fries and chicken huggets and and french fries thank you ! maybe i should cut down"

"bless ashlynn's little heart she just climbed up on my couch to look out the window and then proclaimed it was a \beautiful day\"""""
"<propfemale> is getting so big she just helped me fold the laundry, she hid under the towels and she tried on one of daddy's shirts too fun"

"bingo with besties was way to much fun, i must say i hate wyoming  sad "
"~borrowing a friends status for the day just seems mreally relevent right now: everything happens for a reason; people change so you learn to let go, things go wrong so you appreciate when things go right, you hear lies to learn to trust yourself & good things fall apart so that better things can fall into place   "
