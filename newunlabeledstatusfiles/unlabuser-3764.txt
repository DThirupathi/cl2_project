one thing all guys should know: we worry that other girls look better now that you are in a relationship  <propfirst> nailed the core of every girlfriend's relationship insecurity on the head when he brought up the gigs (grass is greener syndrome)  the idea that life is better on the other side is one of the most destructive forces in relationship world and girls feel that guys fall for it way too often 
it is a great fear of ours that once you canâ€™t have other girls you will suddenly want them all  it leads to a lot of unfounded jealousy brought on by innocent comments on your part or casual non-flirtatious conversations with other girls  so whatâ€™s a guy to do? in a perfect world youâ€™d stop interacting with other girls altogether but our rational super-ego knows thatâ€™s not realistic 
"what you need to do is follow these three simple rules; 1) never pay more attention to another girl than you do to your girlfriend, 2) never comment over and over how hot cool nice fun another girl is, and 3) if you meet a great girl while youâ€™re in a relationship hook her up with one of your buddies (also known as taking her off the market and getting her out of our face) "
"and should you ever really get the itch to jump the fence and live life on the other side    just do it! donâ€™t lead us on, donâ€™t cheat on us, donâ€™t sneak around, just end the relationship  if it ends up being a gigs fueled mistakeâ€¦ oh well, consider it a hard lesson learned and leave us alone    we won't want you back anyway!"
"read from bottom up, and learn!  smile "
what only im up at this time!?!? whats wrong with you people! get up!
doctors don't know anything! > surprise
