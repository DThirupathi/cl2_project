it's taken me a while to realize that often times seemingly good things end for the purpose of obviously greater things to come along   
"final dress of dracula was great! i'm super excited about this show, and everyone else should be too! such\sidenote: i would be the guy to hurt himself   at the curtain call   stupid shoes "
"now it starts   is anyone free on feb 15 from 1 smile 0-3 that would be willing to do a directing scene for me? i need a guy and a girl, i can supply treats!  smile "
"directing analysis, cigarettes, and coffee   this is gonna be a long night   i'll sleep when i'm dead!"
if you would've asked me 2 years ago if i could see myself 2 years later up late doing homework listening to showtunes   i would've called you crazy   life 
( 0 )(â€¢0 ) <propfemale> metcalfe     laugh 
what's up tonight people? let's <propfemale> out!
"one good thing to say about <propfirst>'s day   \\it ends at midnight   "
"\[so why don't we just make out?]    i can tell by your lack of interest i was kidding \"""""
one-act auditions today   it's been a while since i've auditioned for anything   let's see how this goes   
if i didn't look for love in all the wrong places   where else would i look?
is awkward   
"one day, i'll be the love interest, instead of the bad or and funny guy    "
i have this issue where i see a pretty girl   and immediately insert a foot in my mouth  i need a connection   
so my 2 most recent ex-girlfriends have both recently (within the last month) moved out of state   so does this speak volumes as to my character as a boyfriend? maybe  if you can't stand the heat   
high school musical at springer opera house opens tonight!! it's gonna be awesome!! you should probably get your tickets soon   or now 
just paid my dues to be inducted into 2 collegiate honor societies   now i'm just waiting to hear from one more   all i do is win!  laugh 
does anyone know where i can find a set of unmounted deer antlers for cheap or free   preferably free 
has to stop needin' what he wants 
will be spending my spring break catching up on school work and working on props in the shop  anyone wanna come by? you should 
anyone have a copy of glass menagerie i can borrow?
"in the end you'll find, it's always been me versus the world "
"directing analysis, structural analysis, high school musical, portfolio renovation, props for as you like it, props for 8 one-acts, scene rehearsals, theatre manifesto, production meeting  yeah   i don't see sleep on that list either     annoyed "
so there's this girl   and it's complicated   and i'm sure it involves barking and a tree   story of my life 
"i am obviously busy trying to do 5 things at once, you would assume people would notice this and feel i wouldn't be interested in idle chit-chat  you'd be wrong"
breaks are an important part of the day 
today will be a good day  and that's a promise 
i've been called trouble in paradise   
"so there's this girl   she's \no <propfemale>; just a kid from the suburbs with a knack for words and a bad attitude \"" and i'm all about it  haha <propfemale> <propfirst>  laugh """
"is terribly uncooperative and awkward, especially recently  sorry 'bout it "
i should really look into translating all this awesome into not being single  it's getting kinda cumbersome   and lonely 
"officially changing my major   this should be exciting   and frightening   adding an extra semester to my college career, but that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?"
should really shut up sometimes
