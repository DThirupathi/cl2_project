(believe) yes i should go back to elementary school god bless my soul   
i am trying to change the route for itunes library
"ok i just found <propmale> garden inn @ mcdonough, ga!!! i will upload a few pics now "
"now i will try to find a pic of the ugly orange italian hand blown glass spoons-like $10,000 chandelier  i didn't like that one   and i install that one myself, they told me not to break any of the spoons!"
amazing!!! i am on a virtual tour of the hotel!!!
"there i will spend all day fishing on that 15 mile long lake and i will cook my own food on one of the 50 grills, everyday a new one "

"that's why i hate the people that like to make competition, and for them i will write the following: grab the ground with one hand an then stick your finger in the breaker slot or touch any of the hot top lugs and then keep it there and apply more pressure "
"when i want to test something quickly i touch the ground screw with my left thumb, and with the one on my right hand, guess what? yes the hot      "
and when i do that i can feel the 60 hertz per second pulsating and flowing in my blood
"and that doesn't make me any better, instead only somebody out of his mind would do that  "
all this reminds me when i got shocked really bad at the spider's <propmale> i was trying to change this 1 0 wires in the lugs and while i was doing the final tightening on the hot with the <propfirst> wrench this guy turned on the breaker and the bad thing was: i had my knees buried in the mud  after that my whole right arm and hand felt like frozen for about 2 days 
ok end of the night training and remember two things: never try to play with fire and never take the e playful ressway or freeway unless you are a trained professional  
but first: a pic
