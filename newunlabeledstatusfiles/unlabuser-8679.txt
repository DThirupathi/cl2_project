"i'm growing so disturbed\nothing makes sense to me anymore\i'm learning to resist\becoming more than you ever were\\can't e playful lain, what's come over me, come over me\can't e playful lain, why it's so hard for me,\so hard to see your side "
"i'm becoming less defined as the days go by\fading away, well you might say, i'm losing focus\kind of drifting into the abstract in terms of how i see myself\sometimes, i think i can see right through myself\\less concerned about fitting into the world,\your world that is, cause it doesn't really matter anymore"
"the more i stay in here\the more it's not so clear\the more i stay in here\the more i disappear\as far as i have gone\i knew what side i'm on\but now i'm not so sure\the line begins to blur"
"she turns me on,\she makes it real \i have to apologize\for the way i feel\and nothing can stop me now -\there's nothing to fear,\and everything that ever was\is inside of here "
"yes, i am alone but then again i always was\as far back as i can tell\i think maybe it's because\because you were never really real to begin with\i just made you up to hurt myself\and it worked \yes it did!"
"ain't no sunshine when she's gone  \it's not warm when she's away  \ain't no sunshine when she's gone \and she's always gone too long anytime she goes away \\hey, i ought to leave the young thing alone, \but ain't no sunshine when she's gone, only darkness everyday  \ain't no sunshine when she's gone, \and this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away "
"fight\not to fail\\not to fall\\or you'll end up like the others\\die\die again\\drenched in sin\\with no respect for another\\oh! \\down \feel the fire\\feel the hate\\your pain is what we desire\\lost \hit the wall\\watch you crawl\\such a replaceable liar"
"it comes down to this \your kiss \your fist \and your strain \it get's under my skin \within \take in the extent of my sin\\you give me the anger \you give me the nerve \<propfemale> out my sentence \while i get what i deserve \i'm just an effigy to be disgraced \to be defaced \your need for me has been replaced \and if i can't have everything well then just give me a taste "
"talking to myself all the way to the station\pictures in my head of the final destination\all lined up, all the ones that aren't allowed to stay\tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away\\tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches\tried to overcome my complications and my catches\nothin' ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day\tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away"
"the more that we take\the paler we get\i canâ€™t remember what it is\we try to forget\the tile on the floor\so cold it could sting\in your eyes is a place\worth remembering\\for you to go and take this\and smash it apart\iâ€™ve gone all this fucking way\to wind up back atâ€¦back at the start\\the closer we think we are\well, it only got us so far\now youâ€™ve got anything left to show?\no, no i didnâ€™t think so "
"am i \am i still tough enough? \feels like i'm wearing down \is my viciousness losing ground\am i taking too much? \did i cross the line? \i need my role in this \very clearly defined \\i need your discipline \i need your help \i need your discipline \you know once i start i cannot help myself"
"the paranoia is in bloom, the pr\transmissions will resume, they'll try to\push drugs, keep us all dumb down and hope that\we will never see the truth around, so come on\\another promise, another scene, another\package not to keep us trapped in greed with all the\green belts wrapped around our minds and endless\red tape to keep the truth confined, so come on"
