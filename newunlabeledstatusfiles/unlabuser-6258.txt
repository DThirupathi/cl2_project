whats up ppl? im bored like always
hey guys whats up?
haha i lost my phone on the bus a few days ago woohoo smart move on my part haha
"cold was my soul untold was the pain i faced when you left me a <propfemale> in the rain so i swore to the razor that never, enchained would your dark nails of faith be pushed through my veins again -nymphetamine fix by craddle of filth"
"well, yesterday was fun, went to kaili's party, today was ok, im a lil upset seems like a person likes to screw with me and i must say i really hate you and im pretty sure you know who you are persom"
"so all i did pretty much today is go too school and update my info on here a lil bit there problly are some more mistakes that need to be takin care of bt besudes that all i have been doing today is listen to music, ohhh how fun that is "
"save your breath  i will not hear  i think i made it very clear,  you couldnt hate enough to love  is that supposed to be enough? i only wish you wern't my friend  then i could hurt you in the end  i never claimed to be a saint     my hope was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go,"
i used to love and be loved now all i do is hate and be hated the day people learn of my hate is the day they shall suffer as i have suffered it shall be the day i let the world know of my hatred 
my pour old abused soul my soul oh so strong and powerful now broken and bleeding it almost seems like there shall be no return it was ripped out of me i was tortured and beaten then put back in me  just to go through this again
im still here sometimes i wonder why im still waiting sometimes im shaking thats how you make me  sometimes i question  why im still here sometimes i think im going crazy can you help me out next time?
"like roses, we <propfemale> and die"
so turn away from the ones who hurt everyone i can tell by your smile you're coming undone i could bleed for a smile; could die for a gun walk away from the sun and kill everyone
ohhhh how i wish wish this happiness was eternal this happiness is not eternal nor shall it ever be soon i will go back to my mix of emotions it will just be hell again
"we stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore  the days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places  the day you lost him, i slowly lost you too  for when he died, he took a part of you"
well been sick the last two days and i might go to a science fair friday and miss the whole day at school lol 
"no time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes no e playful lanations, no reasons why i watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor we stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore if only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way i would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home again don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end"
wel today was interesting went to the docs got pissed pff a few times today to many to count <propfemale> today over all was pretty eventful i suppose
what would you do if i died at this very moment?
