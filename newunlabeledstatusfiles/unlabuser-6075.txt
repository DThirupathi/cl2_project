"i follow a procession of telephone poles   they keep going, you know  even when you can't see where they've headed "
thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes yesterday   
the problem with trying to make something fool proof is that you underestimate the idiocity of complete fools 
today i was reminded of how quickly your life can be over   
hanging with my cousins   
guess what my family got while i was gone   a new router!  laugh  now my internet problems are solved 
the only good thing about today was i got my <propmale> check   
tgif!  laugh
