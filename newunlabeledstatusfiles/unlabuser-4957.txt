"the most beautiful people are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss and have found their way out of the depths  they have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern  beautiful people do not just happen "
some times you'll never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory
