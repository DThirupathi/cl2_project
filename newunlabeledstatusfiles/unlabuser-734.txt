and then everything was bright and shiny
<propfemale>- boom
"that planet earth turns, slowly"
she stares at me as if she owns the world and we have crashed her party
i can taste you on my lips and smell you in my clothes
and when you close your tired eyes i'll meet you there

right where i want you to be again i love you! i love you! i love you!
you were so close to me that you nearly died
life may be starting soon  smile   thanks to everyone who supported me

"the weight of the world is nothing compared to the weight of a soul, the faithless aren't free"
"now that i've decided not to stay  i can feel me start to fade away  everything is back where it belongs  i will be beside you before long, and on, this goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on this goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on"
