is at home chillaxin 
has been distracted  it's time to get myself in gear for the new year 
doesn't understand all the games on fb  i've gotten a million farmville gifts and have no idea what to do with them  i'm now getting zoo animals too 
just took down the christmas tree  i was kind of glad to see it go this year 
wants to stay in and hide out for a while  everything is safer that way 
is contemplating the highlights in my life that have taken place in 2010  what a year! welcome 2011! i'm ready for the ride!
is freezing and not looking forward to getting out today  i'm feeling confused  it kind of feels like i'm back in michigan and not tennessee sad 
thinks facebook is the devil! i got on the computer to do more productive things somehow got sucked into being on here instead!
was late waking up today  tomorrow i will get <propmale> to school on time!
"saw the coolest thing when i was coming back from doing the laundry  a fox(yes folks a real fox in hendersonville suberbia) was limping through the parking lot and grassy area  i ran up to it him to try and help him and he took off into a run sad  maybe approaching a wild animal wasn't my grandest plan ever, but my <propfemale> to touch everything took over momentarily "
thought i was going to win something cool by taking those quizzes    but didn't  sad 
"how did we meet? everyone play this game! copy and paste this phrase on your profile, you will find it amusing to remember how you met and how you know each of your friends! before you do that, answer me first "
is wanting mother nature to bring on the snow  i want to see this 6 inches we're supposed to get  <propmale>'s school canceled and we have an ample food supply and snowmen that need to be built!
pink
just realized i look like some kind of pervert by liking all your status updates  i'm not i swear!
is wondering why everyone in the nashville area is freaking out over the snow  it is only a dusting people  i used to build snow forts and snow furniture for the interior  with this snow you can't even build a decent snow man  it is miserably cold for no reason sad 
leave a 1-word comment that you think best describes me  it can be only 1 word  no more than 1 word  then copy & paste this post on your wall so i can leave a word about you 
was going to go to bed hours ago! i ended up watching the tudors on showtime on demand and missed out on some much needed rest  now it's time for some beauty rest and i'm going to need lots of it smile 
is sucking down my coffee and enjoying every drop! where would the world be without legal stimulants? aaahhhhhhhhhh
is now getting off the computer for the night  these quizzes are addictive!
is tired of <propfemale> wars! it's time for <propmale> to move onto the next phase!!!!!
is wondering why sumner county schools are closed tomorrow  looks like <propmale> and i will be hanging out again tomorrow smile 
is gonna get my fringe on tonight  woohoo!
is hoping the car will pass emissions testing today even though the check engine light is still blaring back at me  we gotta keep nahville green right? in the meantime i have e playful ired tags and haven't been able to get out much!
is amazed at the strangeness of life sometimes 
is thankful for the sunshine today 
is cracking up at <propmale>!!!! he's singing tnt by ac dc  that's just not right!!!!!
"has checked off a few more things on my \to do\"" list """
fell asleep on the couch and <propmale> thought it was time to party!
"is bothered by this status update  our country was founded on religious freedoms and all cultures having equal rights furthermore,i don't remember christ disrespecting people for the language they speak,or having a different belief system  here are the posts i'm seeing:"
was informed by <propmale> that his middle toe is the one that doesn't stink because that is the toe where the water runs when he showers! ewwwwwwwwwwww!
just found out that aquasand is some of the messiest stuff on earth!!!! parents beware!!!!
"for the record: i did cry while watching the titanic  i'm such a softie i cry when those humane society commercials play, and i still can't watch the disney version of the little matchstick girl or brother bear!"
woke up in a cold appartment  i think my heater must have broken down in the middle of the night sad 
is spinning my wheels in the mud lately 
is hoping it doesn't snow this time!
is sending my good joojoo into the cosmos so that the crazy winter weather will just skip over us!
is going to go play with <propmale> in the snow  here's to hoping he doesn't pelt me with snowballs!!! he's going down!!! smile 
is wondering who else has a twitter account  i just started one and i don't get how to use it!
isn't at all surprised! i'm curious to see how many consecutive weeks go by this time before it happens 
doesn't have to wake up early in the morning tomorrow!!!!! school's cancelled!!!! whoot whoot!!!!
"completely ran out of laundry today so i've been walking back and forth to the complex laundromat in a coat, boxer shorts, and knee high boots  the funny thing is, people around the complex keep stopping me to chat, asking how i'm feeling!"
is wide awake and can't sleep  this sucks sad 
"is wondering if it's wrong to admit that you're going to lose your sanity if your kid is out of school one more day! since winter break, sumner county schools have cancelled class more than they've actually attended "
"sixth straight day     no school  i'm starting to twitch a little, but i think i'll survive!"
is going to celebrate tomorrow by having a quiet day for reflection 
wants to thank you guys for my birthday wishes smile  xo
is feelin' the love  thanks everyone!!!!
try to remember your power to influence the world around you  put out love and patient  energy and soon others around you will mirrior that 
can't find my phone! will someone who's awake please call me  it has to be in the apartment somewhere! let's just hope it's not on silent!
whew     just found it!!!! never mind! thanks <propmale>!!!!!!
"thinks each individual creates her life like a sculpture  she can chip away the unwanted peices from the material that's already there, or she can also add other materials to it, to create something totally different "
is kind of baffled    but whatever!
"<propmale> really wants to t p  someone's house so he asked me if we could do it! my inner child wants to break out the solid black clothes and the ski masks, but unfortunately i have to wear the \mommy shoes\"" and say \""no\""!"""
"woke up to a surprise  i checked the school cancellations just to be funny, and guess what? sumner county is out yet again! i'm glad i checked before we got in the car!"
finally got a call back today! it's at least encouraging!
is blue today     smooth as glass and cool as the sea 
goodmorning sunshine!!!!!
"thinks the \poke\"" function sounds kinda gross  the sick things is i've been \""poked\"" by my mom!!!"""
"just got back home from walmart  that place makes me feel completely scatter-brained  i'm not sure why  maybe it's the lighting, or the fact that it's sensory overload!"
thought it was mildly amusing that i got invited by one of the hospital oncologists to go to a special banquet held for those who have donated their tumors to further cancer research  what an interesting social event!
it's officially <propfirst>'s day in nashville! happy <propfirst>'s day everyone!!!! xoxoxoxoxoxo!!!!
is at home cuddled up on the couch with a sick kid  my poor baby woke up with a sore throat and earache  there's been no monkey business today sad 
"<propmale> has been lying on the couch all day, so he's gotta be sick! all i can get him to eat is beef jerky and popsicles "
yay!!!! no school for <propmale> tomorrow!
thinks that maybe i should stop making such impulsive decisions 
is wondering if any of my adagio peeps have <propfemale> albers's number  i lost it and would like to get ahold of her today

is a poster girl with no poster 
wtf     it's snowing in nashville!!!! this weather is cooky!!!!
noticed today on my homepage that i have recieved multiple pokings! i have to tell you all that i'm just not that kind of girl!!!!
wants you to do that trick  the one where you open your mouth and your face disappears!
"just doesn't have the energy to e playful end at the moment  it's strange how certain situations in life, and some people, can leave you drained, and scratching your head in bewilderment  i'm checking out for a while "
is going to be cleaning up kiddie puke all night  good times!
loves my word of the day  temporize:v to be indecisive or evasive in order to gain time  i bet i can use this a bunch lately 
"everyone has a right to life  if someone can't afford health insurance, and he is not offered coverage through his job, what are his options? the people who work for a living are not the ones others are carrying  the people who work for a living are the ones dying because they can't afford to pay up front healthcare "
thinks it's mildly amusing that on the back of my bag of cashews it says: manufactered on equipment that processes nuts 
"it was kennedy, you'll recall, who insisted that health care was \a fundamental right and not a privilege \"" that's why it's not just legitimate to use reconciliation to complete the work on health reform  it would be immoral to do otherwise and thereby let a phony argument about process get in the way of health coverage for 30 million americans"""
is super super excited and hopeful!!!!!!
is looking forward to seeing mamma mia with my favorite ladies tonight! that will get me through my potentially awkward day 
had a wonderful time seeing mamma mia! i've never seen so many 40+ year old women shaking their booties! it was a blast  overall it has been a very positive day! now to get some rest  tomorrow is so important!
"had a lovely day with my favorite guy  we <propmale> out in the park, fed the geese, and played  it's time to get some rest and put some drops in my ear  i feel an infection coming on sad "
is going to work my magic today smile 
is going to watch 2012 tonight by myself  hopefully it won't freak me out and i'll be able to sleep 
is going to clean out the car today  they could use footage of my car in an episode of hoarders!
"never realized that i'm so bad-mannered and rude until today  i was talking to my mom on the phone, while standing in line at sephora, because i needed her credit card information so that i could return some things for her  when the woman in front of me finished her transaction she told me that it was very rude of me to talk on the phone while waiting in line  i, unfortunately, never got the memo "
aahhhhh     more sunshine!!!!
is hoping some good luck will come my way soon!
wonders how you discipline your child when you're fighting the urge to laugh! i told <propmale> about the time my gym teacher was mean to me  he then asked me where he could find the guy so he could give him a good kick in the nuts! gotta love outside influences!
might be adding another member of the family into the moore household tomorrow!
and <propmale> are welcoming lucky into our family! smile 
has a sick kiddo on my hands  looks like we will be staying in today  sad

is trying to figure out what to do with my surprise day off! maybe i'll finish cleaning the car   maybe not!
is wondering when i should start building the arc!
"i am a cook, a housekeeper, a parent, a teacher, a referee, a nanny, a nurse, a handy man, a maid, security, and a comforter  i don't get holiday, sick pay, or a day off, i work through the day and some of the night, i am under paid and over worked now tell me that your job is harder then mine  repost this if you're a       mom  ? thought this was cute, got it from a friend!see more"

wants to wish all my friends and family a happy easter passover     which ever applies to you  smile

is finding it difficult to go into work after my three day weekend  the weather is so beautiful i'd rather go outside and play!
seriously dictionary com??!!! my word of the day is     land of nod:n  sleep     how lame!!! or maybe it's even more lame that i subscribe to have a word of the day  i'm not completely sure!=~)
the 4 hour gap in my schedule is ricockulous!
"had an awesome start to my weekend  now it's time to go get the kiddo and get ready later for \girls' night in\"" at my place!"""

is loving the irony lately!
so     how's that weather?
is feeling spent at the moment 
had the funniest client today  he told me that he would never date a massage therapist after having an appointment with me because he would fear getting his ass whooped! too funny smile 
<propmale> just asked me if he could get an agent! wow!
is apparently a true michigander!
on the floor by the front door 
is okay!
drives even slower while being tailgated!
feels like i'm playing a game of pacman while trying to get around the water submerged city 
"is wondering how long my drive into work will take from hendersonville to nashville today  does anyone know if viatnam vets has been reopened, or how long it will take me?"
knows when to bow gracefully and exit the room 
wants to thank all my family and friends for the mothers day wishes yesterday!
is feeling the zen 
is feeling nuttier than a fruitcake    but what's new?
all the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy  what right have we then to depreciate imagination ~carl jung~
"the mind is everything  what you think you become \\buddha"
everything has its beauty but not everyone sees it  ~confusius~
"and whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith \\~jesus christ~"
"no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it \\~albert einstein~"
just saw a bicycle with a motor on it going down 11th ave! how awesome is that??!!
you must be the change you wish to see in the world ~gandhi~
is about to take the real age test  i'm feeling pretty confident because i eat nuts every day  this is sure to add an extra five years!

"let us more and more insist on raising funds of\love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace  money will come if we\seek first the kingdom of god - the rest will be given \\~mother teresa~"
is going to go batty! <propmale> is break dancing to <propmale> paisley! i can't stand country music but allow freedom of e playful ression in my household! i'm rethinking that approach at the moment!
is bored with my hair  does anyone have any haircut ideas that would go with my very french looking bangs?
now has some direction after fumbling in the dark for a spell  the cool thing is that once i make up my mind i don't stop until it's done  my stubborness can at times work in my favor 
can't wait for beauty and the beast with my ladies tonight!
got the most awesome text today! it said:happy fathers day to the wonderful mother that's all the father her child will ever need! thanks <propfemale>! i do want to wish a happy fathers day to all the great dads out there and all the mothers who have to be both!

is trying to get all my ducks in a row and my poop in a group!
"is disappointed with myself because i ate nothing but junk food today  i could always use the excuse that my boss \twisted my arm\"" to eat the cake she made after i ate mcdonalds!"""
"is pooped! i cleaned out my car today  that took two trashbags  i also cleaned and organized two closets on top of working! i really have to stop throwing things in the closets so that i can pretend the house is clean  i'm on a mission to stop being such a hot mess! i'm hoping this time it lasts longer than a couple of weeks  i swear, i think my brain short circuits when it comes to having organization skills!"
doesn't like being mean! it takes too much energy 
is high on cold medicine    and i kinda like it!
is so over it! time for mean <propfemale> to make an appearance!
finished out the work week this afternoon    then    back to work on sunday!
made it the entire day without getting called into work  i'm going to the pool and not taking the phone since i no longer have to be ready to jump in the car and drive to an appointment at a moments notice  i will return all calls later  now time for sunshine!
woke up with a foot in my back! hopefully <propmale> won't have anymore nightmares  he's getting too big to sleep in my bed!
has decided not to care  it's really a lot easier that way 
"wonders why southern people ask how you're doing and then walk away before you can answer  it's just weird! if you don't care, why must you ask?"
is in the boro today for a trade show 
slept for over 8 hours  i think i needed that even though i feel a bit sluggish 
is amazed at how time seems to be speeding up and slipping through my fingers with age  i wish i could go back and stop time on those happy moments where anything seemed possible and hold them in my hands  if only   
is amazed at how time seems to be speeding up and slipping through my fingers with age  i wish i could go back and stop time on those happy moments where anything seemed possible and hold them in my hands  if only 
"loves it when <propmale> and i have laid back, snuggley mornings  affection from an eight year old boy comes sporadically, so i snatch it up when i can  it makes being a mom during the tough times worth it!"
still proudly remains a twilight and true blood virgin! i refuse to conform to pop culture!
wonders sometimes if anybody really gets me    
got a much needed recharge today! what a blast!
realized that i have to do back to school shopping this weekend  this means that i'm going to have to fight the crazed crowd of parents at the local wal-mart  let the pandemonium begin!!!
is about to take <propmale> to get his hair cut for school  not without a fight though! he's such a little hippie!
feels well rested once again 
really enjoyed seeing cats and dogs with <propmale> today!
got my e-cigs in yesterday! day 2    no smoking 
"will undoubtedly show up for work tomorrow with tear streaks down my face  tomorrow is <propmale>'s first day of third grade  i think i get more nervous than he does  all day i will worry whether he likes his new teacher, or whether he is making new friends! ugh!"
"wishes sumner co  schools communicated things better! everyone showed up for school this morning thinking there was class and it's still an inservice day! the kids don't start until friday  we did get to meet the teacher, see the classroom, and get the paper work "
has lived as a non smoker for almost a week and doesn't want to punch anyone yet! go me!
wonders how <propmale>'s first day of third grade is going  i can't wait to pick him up and hear all about it!
"is happy to have a very relaxed, fun-filled evening!"
"isn't defined by my car, where i live, my stuff, or my profession  these are just stops along my way and will continue to change "
is super excited about my 3 day weekend! i want to take <propmale> to do something fun! just a couple more days   
can't stand this crazy heat anymore! i thought i lived in tennessee    not hell!!
doesn't want this weekend to end for a number of reasons  life is full of interesting surprises 
is such a dork  i realized today the lyrics to the song were aahh ohh gotta let go  i've been singing ahh ohh galileo! lol    i hope nobody has heard me sing it that way!
"loves being surrounded by positive, kind, uplifting people  those who make fun of people, speak critically of others, or are not able to empathize, appear arrogant, but are really insecure  i have figured out that you can not change that type of person by arguing with them  that puts you at their level  so, i <propmale> out those kind of people like yesterday's trash "
is hoping mister sun makes an appearance today!
actually agreed with <propmale> <propfirst> this morning on his stance about the muslims building their place of worship where they want  he spoke of religious tolerance and freedoms  is <propmale> going liberal on us?!??
is all sunshine and rainbows today 
needs to get a video camera  <propmale> was dancing around without a shirt like <propfirst> mouse in the old black and white cartoons  he looked like a wiggly skeleton! he's too funny!
massage therapy friends: i just found an at home package deal for my c e u s  it's $455 for 50 hours  is this ligit?

had a seriously bad day! <propmale> and i are displaced because our apartment flooded and the ceiling callapsed sad 
is very lucky to have such a great support system  now to just get over this hump of craziness!
is waiting on my car while it gets repaired  oh what a week!
is really hoping my apartment gets fixed sometime this century! at least i have the day off work tomorrow!
is moving today! unfortunately the only thing my apartment complex has available is a bigger unit with a fire place and an extra bathroom    darn! no more crazy sea shell bathtub for me either!
had a hair mishap today  looks like i'll be wearing <propfemale> <propfemale> bangs for a few weeks  oh well    i think i can rock it 
"now has time to relax! the move is complete! yay! to top it off, monday night <propmale> gave me a \spa pedicure\"" and <propfirst> brought me a flower  sweet smile """
has been on the computer for the past three hours doing my c e u's  i feel cross eyed but i have completed 11 hours  just 45 more hours to complete by the end of the year! i have a feeling i'm going to be pulling a lot of all-nighters! it doesn't pay to be a procrastinator!
is spiritually tired!
forgot school pictures for <propmale> were today  i realized it when i dropped him off at school and everyone was dressed up for the occasion! oh well    he kind of likes being the rebel anyways 
"finds it incredibly difficult to wake up in the morning now that my apartment faces north  i miss the morning sun blaring in my window, signaling my body to start the day  i'm now going to have to get a more annoying alarm "

hypothesizes that god has a massive sense of humor 
"even the <propmale> are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own \\mother <propfemale>"
is excited about things to come  sometimes change can be a good thing even though it can be scary and unsettling

"is wearing my lucky <propfemale> beads, my venezuelan luck beads, and my lucky greenstone  a girl can never wear too many good luck charms at once "
is blown away     i'm a blessed girl    thanks dad!

"had a wonderful christmas! not just because of the gadgets, jewelry, and the other gifts  i feel i have so much to celebrate this year and i'm looking forward to see what 2011 brings!"
"wonders if my neighbor knows the walls are incredibly thin and i can hear him singing \blue christmas\"" very clearly  i'm not going to tell him because i enjoy the free entertainment every afternoon!"""
is playing with my new gadget 
has all the loose ends tied  procrastination won't be happening in 2011!
can only imagine that the questions that <propmale> has been asking are going continue to get more awkward as he gets older  my method of answering his questions by turning it around and asking him questions isn't going to hold up much longer  raising a boy is definitely interesting!
has been needing more sleep lately  not really sure what's up with that 
hates when it snows here  the city has literally shut down  i guess i should have joined the masses and stockpiled food 
is still cracking up over what <propmale> said this morning  unfortunately it isn't appropriate to post 
thinks the schools were a bit silly for cancelling today  it was nothing but warm sunshine!
wishes calgon really would take me away! talk about false advertising!
"has to show my liberal love today with a quote from dr  king \~like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity  hate destroys a man's sense of values\and his objectivity  it causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false\and the false with the true ~\well said! let's take today to honor a beautiful human being "

"got called stupid today by some random man at the gas station for the way i parked my car  while it's entirely possible that i may be stupid, i'm at least a nice person with manners  i suppose if i had a choice between being a smart a@$hole or a stupid nice person, stupid is going to win hands down  other than that i had a good day today  i had to take <propmale> to work with me and he was a perfect angel!"
"is heartbroken! <propmale> told me that he doesn't want me to go to his valentines day party at school for the first time ever! he says that i embarrass him! i think i'm a cool and hip mom  i miss the days when he told total strangers that he had the prettiest mom  so, what do i do? do i show up anyways, or do i just not go?"
