"is thinking about ps  73  things are not different today because it is a different century  people are just the same as they were back in asaph's day  as long as the outside of the cup looks clean, why bother to look at the stuff deep inside? they think it is hidden, but it is visible in their works  a good tree does not bear bad fruit and a bad tree does not bear good fruit  you will know them by their fruits "
