"sometimes when people are trying as hard as they can to do the right thing, it seems to be the people that want it most for them that keeps pushing them backwards   once in a while everyone should step back and take a different look at the ones we love  are they still screwing up??  or are we making it harder for them then needed???"
"when loves hits you, it seems like you would give anything and everything to not lose it  but what if it is only you loving them?? where does the strength come from to say \goodbye\""  you can't  force someone to love you  you can't pick the ones you love       is it really better to \""hurt then feel nothing at all??\"""""
romantic love is an illusion  most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames       
"love - a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain, causes eyes to <propfemale>, cheeks to glow, blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker"
"amoris vulnus idem sanat, qui facit  translation: the wounds of love can only be healed by the one who made them"
"\one man by himself is nothing  two people who belong together make a world \"""""
"i just don't understand how someone who is guilty of something, can stand there accusing you of doind what they are guitly of     how in the hell does that work??"
"i hate people that are double standard, and lie to the ones they have no reason to lie to          people suck!!"

"i'm a bitch !!!unfortunately most women won't repost this i'm a handful, i'm strong willed, independent, a bit outspoken and i tell it like it is  i make mistakes, i am sometimes out of control & at times hard to handle  but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure as hell       don't deserve me at my best  if you're a bitch , repost! i dare you! i'll be looking for the ladies who repost!!!!!!!!"
"please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity  people need to understand that stupidity is real & should be taken seriously  you could be sitting next to a sufferer right now  there is still no known cure for stupidity, and sympathy does not help but we can raise awareness  93% won't copy and paste this, because they don't know how to copy and paste"
"we are asking everyone to say a prayer for \darkhorse\"" 3rd battalion 5th marines and their families  they are fighting it out in afghanistan and have lost nine marines in four days  please repost this  it would be nice to see on everyones wall"""

"    when you feel down, look at yourself through god's eyes  there are times when no matter how hard you try, you just cannot accept yourself as you are  during such times, think of how you look to god's eyes  in god's eyes, there is no judgment, there is only acceptance  god sees your light when all that you can see are your shadows  god loves you more than anyone could ever love you as you really are   "
don't feel good      wanna go to bed!!!
saying goodbye is one of life!s meanest lessons
