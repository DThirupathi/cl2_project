"\the politics of ecstasy are real can't you feel them working thru you turning night into day mixing sun with the sea\"" - <propfirst> <propmale> morrison"""
"how long until the tables turn? when will we ever, will we ever get what we deserve?"
parties for her right to fight 
"is tired of summer classes  whats up, exam? i'd rather be wasting my time on social networking sites, staying out too late with the crew & gettin' jiggy with my <propmale> "
"is seeing <propfemale> <propfirst> tonight with hamballin'  she kissed a girl & liked it, then she woke up in vegas or something so i'm glad an artist that appeals to young kids warns the youth about the dangers of drug use?"
"can't imagine life without text messaging  its an addiction, i can't wait to see it on \intervention\"" """
"likes to twitter  okay, there- the truth is out  yes, i realize i'm ranking high on the lame scale but i guess i should be a stalker when i grow up cause i love knowing what other people are doing   constantly "
loves balloons  upgrade: balloon animals 
"is making dreams, breaking scenes & shaking things up "
"is 8,674 3421% sure that <propfirst> <propfirst> is her exact counterpart  you kids better be ready to purchase my novel "
"tried this trick to spin it  her head collapsed but there's nothing in it  and she'll ask herself, \where is my mind\""?"""
"that's the danger in starting a fire, you'll never know how many bridges you'll burn "
"i'm keeping an eye on the future, an eye on the past & the present in my pocket just in case i need a door "
"left her cellular device at <propfirst>'s house & feels rather incomplete  <propfirst> <propmale>, call me on the tin can phone "
"we can pull a map out detailing the direct route  young ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the fray  if we don't wake up and the truth never comes up- you will never have our old <propfirst>, you will never have a right of way "
"my adoptive hispanic family hooked it up in my easter baskets! i'm not tired of eating <propfemale> yet, i'm tired of reminding myself i'll be at the gym tomorrow  whats up, butterfinger?"
i guess it goes full circle like a cheerio- cause you're rockin' what i was rockin' like a year ago!
"watching live ducklings splash around in my bath tub = the cutest thing i've ever seen  oh boy, they sure do love tomatoes!"
"since when do strangers at the gym not enjoy positive affirmations? apparently, \you go girl! high five!\"" means roll your eyes & walk away """
"whatchu know bout <propfirst> 5000 watts?! if heavy wasn't performing, you would not see me at bikini beach  i'm making an exception "
social life < artistic e playful ression  2x + dubstep night < $20 4 225 = $4 734  <propfirst> > showering -7x  comfort > pants  i think that was the new compound inequality demonstration of my current state 
"i love my duckies  they are the only being that can shart frequently & still be so cute  i find duck feet hilarious, this is also a factor "
i translate my investments with hustlenomics   over $100 spent at the vet so quackie <propfemale> could get some sizzurp   prognosis: permanently sittin' sideways 
two thoughts: i'm extremely grateful for the education i received through ccisd  i feel incredibly rude when wearing flip-fops in a library 
wake up in the morning smelling like beyonce  i bet you read that in your head to the tune of a ke$ha song 
"since i also enjoy getting money, as well as staying true, i'm stoked to meet <propfirst> wall today  laugh "
maybe the reasoning behind my avoidance of checking my voicemails is related to the fact that i can't leave a decent voicemail 
"tonight i was the <propfemale> prom <propfemale>  but <propfirst> had three boyfriends, two dresses & plenty of coin  whos the real winner?"
"fml  i have two baby ducks at home, i can't afford a ticket  i hope you made your quota, officer speedtrap  you didnt protect or serve me!"
"\now i have 4 rotton bananas in the ice box & i can't get my hair to stop smelling like bananas  yes! we all feel like dishrags \""- wise """
"yes  alexisonfire on monday! i'm so thrilled, i may pee  <propfirst> green is the verbal interpretation of my every inner thought "
"anyone interested in tickets to <propfirst> morrison tomorrow night? my friend has two, $20 each  if not, i will attend instead  its whatever  haha"
hollering at super happy fun land to see somosuno & blackie  it feels like summer now since i have a backpack of beer instead of books 
 laugh  yoga then tanning at a beautiful pool looking over clear lake with the bestfriend  maybe i've reached the p-diddy morning state of mind 
"y por eso los grandes amores de muchos colores, me gustan mi  cool, another spanish song stuck in my head  now i have to be annoying "
"best advice all day: \if that fails just say fuck it & get corn rows\""  i want to hit drinco de mayo tonight! study study study study study """
i turned off my twitter text alerts last week & realized something was missing in my life since i didnt know what @hollyvalentine was up to 
"my cell phone is deceased  or atleast in a serious coma  i feel so alone without random texts, twitter alerts, & annoying phone calls "
i just applied to be on the real world  who wants to help me make a video? i realized around three a m  last night that perhaps reality television is my true calling 
"happy 21st birthday, <propfirst> toman!  laugh  tonight i'm gonna have myself a real good time "
"tyger! tyger! burning bright in the forests of the night, what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
"i wish i was awkward looking & skinny enough to be a urban outfitter's model  not because thats attractive, but because i want all of their clothes  for free  seriously "
"yes! not only did i just have an awesome dinner & dessert- but guess who got a leopard print snuggie for her birthday?! yeah, me  this is a gift that keeps on givin' "
i ate an entire cantaloupe today  this is a true story 
"the assignment: develop a non-literal interpretation of a certain song, likely non-objective  medium: acrylic paint, musical artist: daft punk, song? i can't decide "
"i love ridiculous snuggie commercials, the things kanye west says, and the fact that i ate 5 popsicles today  my life is so deep "
"how strange, the golfers on the course at san jac don't enjoy dubstep as much as i do  did you just give me the finger over some wub wub wub dubs?"
