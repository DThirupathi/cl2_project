"   if i could see the future and how this plays out, i bet it's better than where we are now, but after going through this, it's easier to see the reason why   "
   if your going through hell keep going   
   follow your instincts   thats where true wisdon manifests itself   
   it takes years to build up trust but only seconds to destroy it   
   when you dont know where your going every road will take you there   
"  sometimes we need to stop analyzing the past, stop planning the future, stop trying to figure out precisely how we feel, stop deciding wit our mind what we want our heart to feel, sometimes we just have to go wit whatever happens - happens   "
"   imagination is stronger than knowledge, myth is more potent than history, dreams are more powerful then facts, hope always triumphs over e playful erience, laughter is the only cure for grief, and love is stronger then death   "

"a boy is a magical creature, you can lock him out of your workshop, but you canâ€™t lock him out of your heart  you can get him out of your study, but you canâ€™t get him out of your mind "

"love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship  it's not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end "
"sometimes what you want isn't always what you get, but in the end what you get is so much better than what you wanted"

"   but maybe a happy  ending doesnt include a guy maybe it's u  picking up the pieces n starting over freeing urself up for something better in the future  maybe the happy ending is just moving on  maybe the happy ending is knowing after all the unreturned phone calls, brokenheart,s the blunders n misread signals, the pain n embarrassment u never gave up hope "
everyone in the world say's he loves somebody   but in the end it doesnt mean anything  what you feel only matters to yourself   its what you do to the people that you say you love that matters   it's the only thing that really counts    
   its not easy to forgive   nor does it mean forgeting

   had a dream that fire fell from an opening in the sky  someone warned me of this hell & i spit in his naive eye & left him crying for my soul he said would die  in the hearts of the blind somethin u'll never find is a vision of light w the voice of the dead i'm screaming   i don't know who i am anymore

   in youth we learn    in age we understand   
"monsters are real and ghosts are real too  they live inside us, and sometimes   they win"
  life happens n people change  
keep love in your heart  a life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead  the consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring
"   love me without fear, trust me without doubt, love me without restrictions, want me without demand, accept me how i am   "
"a true friend loves you for who you are   they don't care if ur place is messy, you don't have money this wk or that ur family isn't perfect   a true friend can go long periods of time without speaking n never question their friendship "
who are you to tell me that i'm less then what i should be?
idk why we all <propfemale> on to something we know were better off letting go  it's like were scared to lose what we really don't even have  some of us say wed rather have somethin then nothin @ all  but the truth is   to have something half way is harder then not having it @ all 
"love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a teardrop"

"every man lies, but give him a mask n he will b sincere"

i hate this grrr
i discovered i always have choices and sometimes it's only a choice of attitude
"it is our choices that show what we truly are, far more then our abilities"
exellence is not a singular act but a habit   you are what you repeatedly do 
"there are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them"
the greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude
"y do ppl persist in a dissatisfying relationship, unwilling either to work toward solutions, or end it n move on?  is it because they kno changing will lead to the unknown n most ppl believe that the unknown will b much more painful then what they're already e playful eriencing?"
"the person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, and becomes nothing  he may avoid suffering n sorrow but he simply cannot learn n feel n change n grow n love n live"
to love is to risk not being loved in return  to hope is to risk pain  to try is to risk failure; but the greatest hazzard is life is to risk nothing
courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgement that something is more important then fear
life doesn't always turn out the way you plan
