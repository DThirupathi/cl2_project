i give up on writing  it all sucks 
"i'm hurting on the inside, but what's new? i'm head over heels in love with this guy   but it really seems too good to be true  there's no way he could want anything to do with me or my son   "
damn   milwaukee is flooded to hell! just got home from <propfirst>'s birthday dinner  a 30 minute car drive took us close to 90 minutes   
i have two baby cows! not even joking!
"i can't stop thinking about this amazing guy  he's handsome, smart, quirky, vivacious, accepting, lovable, and incredibly outgoing  i miss hom so much; hopefully i'll get to see him really soon   "
"well, <propmale> is looking pretty healthy  <propfirst> bought him a pink <propmale> onesie from target  got to chill with darian and the cows for a little bit  now just relaxing in bed, hoping i get to talk to a certain someone at somepoint "

"fog rolls in \\a man cuts wood \\a spider feasts upon insects \\fire blazes to combat the darkness \\the smoke swirls into the fog \\   a vortex of light and dark emerges \\they seem as one, yet remain separate \\as they fade into oblivion "
hoping against all hope that he'll come see me   my heart might break if he doesn't   
well   i officially want to curl up in a corner and disappear   let's see if we can manage that 
"i've never known the loving of a man, but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand  there's a boy here in town who says he'll love me forever, who would have thought that forever could be severed by the sharp knife of a short life?"
hmm   made spaghetti for dinner  now to relax and finish my book   i'm running out of new material to read    troubled 
"ugh   can't sleep for the life of me    i finished my book   now i have nothing to read   what a disappointment  tomorrow is going to be miserable, but i'll just have to bear with it  night <propmale>  i love you "
"can't believe how depressed i am    the nightmares i can attempt to deal with   i don't know how to not feel lonely though  its going to be a long, painful 6 months   "

"well i'm babysitting a 3 month-old pitbull puppy named jax  he's so adorable, and such a sweetheart  really missing a certain someone (and \secretly\"" hoping they have to take a class before they leave   """
 heart-broken 
"having a lazy day  sitting on the couch reading another book  hope i get to \see\"" my love today """
"court went okay-ish  i have so much on my mind right now    i promised that i'd love him no matter what, and i still do  why doesn't he realize that? and if he has   why doesn't it matter  i gave my heart to him completely, and i don't want it back  its his "
"today is going to be a really long day  packing for the waupaca trip today, trying to figure a few things out, and thinking about someone that means a lot to me "
waupaca with the whole family  7 days of being surrounded by skaggs people  this ought to be entertaining 
i`ve come to the conclusion that pregnant women are worthless   i used to beast at paddle boats and now i can hardly go to the other side of the lake!

"i missing being told \i love you\"" at night and being woken up by \""good morning beautiful\""  i`d give anything to have that back   """

"went for a boat ride today - its awkward being told that you're \hot\"" by 27 year old men in front of your dad and little sister    but it's better than being told you're unattrctive i suppose   """
wow   shitty day so far  i need a pick-me-up in the worst way 
seeing my mum again today!
"i think there must be something wrong with me  for any guy man in my life   the e playful iration date is about 3 years  am i repulsive, defective, or just unlovable by the male species? i really don't get it and i'm tired of having my heart broken repeatedly by people who get me to believe that they love me   "
"why can't i get him out of my head all of a sudden? all i can say is \ouch\""   """
dating sites make me giggle on the inside  i love being dared to do things   especially when i follow through with them
