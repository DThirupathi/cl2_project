finally found a sushi bar in kennewick!!!! *cheers*
i hope everyone has a blast this weekend (literally)  it's 100 degrees here but massively low humitity  was a awesome weekend it's going to be  smile 
it was over 100 today and i decided we were having pork steaks and baked potatoes    now it's warm in here  thankfully we have ac   unlike most of the west side of the state  i feel so bad for my western washington friends and family

"ug i don't know how you people deal with this humidity, i feel sticky  i can't wait to get back to my desert "
yay back in the warm dry desert  it's gonna take at least a day to completely dry out  it's really is amazing how vastly different eastern wa and western wa are  you can't totally appreciate it until you've lived over here for awhile and then go back over 
<propfirst> is having a blast at band camp  i just got off the phone with her and can't wait to see her tomorrow at parents day  smile

can't sleep  sad 
<propfirst> was in her first parade today  smile  pictures later!
so i got my eyebrows waxed for the first time ever    and now i have some little bump thingies in that spot like look like annoyed folicals or pores or something    just a few of them  she did say that i have very think strong hairs that didn't want to let go lol    they look like zits i think    although i've never had a zit so no clue

"although you usually don't lose your temper so easily, you feel on-edge today and any little thing can tick you off  you may be frustrated with your own responses that set the stage for angry words, which just seem to slip out before you stop them  be honest about your concerns, but under no circumstances should you place any blame on anyone else  i know this is just for fun but sometimes it's a bit to accurate"
crazy is in the eye of the beholder 
is totally stressed out
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
can't sleep

came home to a house full of sick people
the kids all feel better thankfully but now i'm sick   sad 
being sick sucks but it could be worse  i know it's the flu only because of the achiness but it feels more like a bad cold with a slight fever then the flu  i've had much much worse flu
is finally feeling better  my energy level is still pretty bad but the rest is gone and the kids are all better and back in school

sometimes i think i'm the only sane person in the world
this year needs to be over  it has been the suckiest year ever

working is seriously cutting into my goof off time
is up way to late    again   at least it's earlier then the other day  oh and it's snowing ice and snow    it should be very pretty when the sun hits it in the morning but very much a pita

some people have no business doing anything having to do with graphic arts
"fyi <propfirst> is not in hawaii yet, he is sitting on a base waiting for the tsunami to pass before he flys out  luckly for us this warning happened prior to them flying out  they were all loaded on the plane when it came through "
i'm not very good at this whole being away from my husband thing  i am a horrible military wife lol
"so here i am, in hawaii, stuck on the military base until 2pm  i am not complaing though because i can see the ocean from my room and    i'm in hawaii!!!!"
so i had dinner at benihana's the night before last  really great food and we went to some place called senor frogs last night and they have huge freakin drink  so one 28 oz a 42 oz and a 10 oz <propfemale> <propfemale> and i felt no pain the rest of the night  the walk back to the car was comical
"i'm not ready to come home yet, but i'm ready to see the kids  maybe i can fly them down and just live here"
is home
there is a point where i told you so won't even cover it  maybe sky writing it would work   hmm no    oh i know writting it on the <propfemale> for the world to see might just cover it  not gonna e playful lain    just know that i was right on a massive scale 
"can't sleep  i always hate when hubby isn't at home, i can never sleep"

"my new motto for life: \i reject your reality and substitute my own\"""""
a real friend is someone who will help you hide the body
is squinting suspiciously but isn't saying why
is killing super mutants with a giant gatling lasor while wearing power armor  roar!!! now this is the way to take out frustrations 
really? i mean    really? did you honestly think that was a good idea? *shakes her head in disbelief*
is self reflecting
is in a relatively good mood

is making cheesecake for tomorrow
needs to eat breakfast before i just dig into the cheesecake calling my name     no    can't eat  it    saving for after dinner    must resist

f o c u s 
hahahahahahahahahaha
has something weighing heavily on her mind  i wish i could talk about it but i can't  don't worry mom no one is hurt and the family is all fine  this isn't anything to do with family 
it is quite a compliment when your 5 year old eats every bite of his dinner then asks for more  (and no it wasn't junk food)
"my brain is e playful loded around the room as i go through all the financial paperwork and box up the older stuff to store  as i go through all the old paperwork, i am finding cards and letters from december  they are making me a bit sad, but i have to get this done, so i can't dwell  moving on is hard but necessary  it's surprising to me that it is effecting me this way  it's almost a weird sort of mourning "
i don't think i can even come up with the words to say how much i love my husband  11 years of marriage and 14 years since we started dating went by so fast  i am so luck that he walked into the right classroom on the wrong day   smile 
"two of my closest friends (<propfemale> and <propfemale>) took me out for a day of beauty today  hair, makeup, clothing shopping and nails  what a great day and what wonderful friends i have  i am extremely lucky to have met the people i have met over the last year   love "
ugh  i feel like a chipmunk  my cheeks are swollen from having my wisdom teeth pulled  but the vicodin is nice lol
some people need a good thrashing
is very proud of her daughter
"i don't care what your stance is or what party you are with  everyone needs to vote  it is extremely important and it is your responsibility  in my opinion, if you don't vote you don't have the right to whine about the results  get out and vote people!!!"
