hi my name is <propmale> i'm a graduate from south stokes high and i am in a relationship looking to become a police officer so please if anyone is interested in talking to me about this please email me thanks   
just bored and taking quizzes while thinking about my fiance and how cool it is seeing old friends 
"went to the <propfemale> classic last night with my fiance  it was a lot of fun, glad to have a girl like her around  had tons of laughs and smiles  no trouble at all except for running out of cash for a minute, haha  but it was all well worth it "
had lots of fun today and can't wait for the next one 
life isn't about how many risk you take or how many injuries you substain along the way  it's how you push through the pain and solve the situation  whether there's a team with you or you're alone  in order to live you must be willing to risk it all or nothing  to die is to live and to live is to dream  either way <propfemale> every moment because it may not be another one like it around the next bend over the horizon 
a sword is tested by its stength of the blade  a warrior is tested by their will to survive the fight  the results are always the same if neither is ready for the situation that lies ahead of them 
it's not about how you use the weapon  it's about who's firing it  gun control is about hitting your target instead of who's hands it's in  that's the parent's job to teach that lesson  not the government's  ease up on the gun preaching and let us every day people do the teaching 
politians live life telling lies while the working family lives their lives paycheck to paycheck  guess the government has better things to do before the working family is finally able to live like they deserve to 
"you can corner a tiger but eventually it's going to fight back  which means, just because you're strong or have more than the next, you shouldn't push it on them because eventually they're going to come right back at you "
"love is like a sword  it can hurt deeply if your heart is broken but if you need something to live for and there's someone waiting for you, then it'll keep you alive and give you something to live for  the good news is that it's also free of charge as well "
education isn't just in the text books  it's in everything you do 
"mornings are natures way of saying \here we go again\"" haha"""
it's not how many shots that's fired during battle  it's how good you make them count that matters 
a person's choices are like a game of black <propfirst>  you're not always going to be the dealer or always get twenty one but you use the cards you have to work in your favor which in all hopes everything is eventually work its self out 
"is one bullet not worth the price of saving one's life or someone else's? would it still be murder if you killed in order to protect your self or your love one? is justice to be by the law, god, or natural? whose side of the story really matters when all the smoke and ashes have cleared?"
it's not the dog in the fight  it's the size of the fight in the dog 
"it's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep going  how much you can take and keep going  that's how winning is done! - slyvester stallone from <propmale> balboa"
life's a game of <propmale>  it all depends on how you live which will determine the difficulty 
it maybe cold outside but the warmth of someone's heart and soul is what will keep you warm when it all comes down to it 
"it's not cold outside, it's just a cool breeze on a very weird summer day"
is the price of life really worth all the oil in kuwait? is one drop of blood worth one swallow of water? is living your life without someone to share it with worth living? is doing the right thing really doing the right thing?
running on ice is like spinning tires on hot pavement  sure you can do it for a little bit but sooner or later you're going to hurt something 
when looking in the mirror are you seeing your self or who you think you are?
"when in a fight to protect someone else, remember that if you lose then they lose  if you win then they win because they live to see another day because of you "
if the only person you've ever loved turned around and loved someone else    would you still love them or would you leave?
is life a dream or a story that is being played out as you go along?
is it possible to live and let die or is a memory or situation something you would onto for as long as you live?
"after every thing that has been proved to be illogical or impossible, then what always remains is the truth  no matter how much you don't wish to believe it "
"nothing is ever impossible, it's just really complicated "
is bringing natural justice to those that deserves it or should you let the law or god handle the situation? is it right or wrong? would it be right or wrong amongest the views of others or would it even matter?
"if you don't try to save one life then you'll never save any  it's just a matter on how you save them  it can be by donating blood, giving them a meal that you were planning to eat, talking to them, defending them in a fight or from the shadows    we're all meant for something good   it's just that the world all has it own point of views on that term "
it's not who you are but what you do that defines how you are looked at and who you are to the rest of the world 
"if you loving something they tell you to let it go, but i say if you love something or someone, then do everything you can to make it good, right, and true because if you love it enough then it'll be everlasting "
the dark is feared but the light is loved  little do most people realize it's not what you can't see but instead it's what you do see that makes you believe and question what lies ahead 
"it's up to us to find something worth fighting for and when we do, we need to pass that on to our children and grand children so that the future generations can fulfill whatever parts we missed along the way and help us live forever "
"it's not the fight that matter, it's a matter of who and why you're fighting them  you have to control the outcome because if you don't then you've already lost and if you're trying to protect someone   well then they've lost too  that's why you have to keep your cool and determine your actions, attack and defend, watch your surroundings, and always never back down "
"starting to hate vehicles with about as much as computers  just got a new 700 cold crank battery, a new alternator, and now got to go and get new tires too! just replaced the spark plugs, changed the oil recently, got to fix the inside door hook so i don't have to roll my window down to open the door    i just want another one with <propmale> windows instead of power and please let it get good mpg's too!"
"oh and lastly but the most important of all    let it be an american made vehicle! that's unless it's a honda civic 1998 automatic coupe model    then i won't complain as much, haha "
"if something isn't broken why fix it? answer is, so you don't have to worry about it breaking   at least for a while then you worry about what else you have to do later "
"when you look down the sights or optics of a firearm arm, it's not what or who you are shooting at  it's why and how you're shooting that matters  so if you're using your firearm to protect others you care about or hunting for food then that's gun control "
"the problem isn't lawful gun control, then problem is awful parenting skills that's causing situations or misuse of firearms to happen  please if you're a parent or an older sibiling with a fire arm, teach the younger ones to keep their hands off of them until the proper age and also, keep your weapons stored in a safe place away from little children  that'll solve gun control issue out there "
a battle won by strength alone is a war that's lost  a battle won by wits is a war that's lost as well  but a battle that is won by both strength and wits is a battle that is sure to win 
congratulations to the lady saura's soccer team last night defeating north forsyth 0 - 9  this game was one the best that i've seen in a long time  ps: good job last night <propfemale> baby  good luck against mcmicheal tonight smoke those phoenix out 
"hold everyday close but hold the nights ever closer because the most important things are the ones that you can see and hold  the nights hold secrets awaiting to be answered while the days are full of the same old, same old  look in the dark and <propfemale> the light with you "
"to kill one person for no reason is murder, to kill one hundred people is to be a tyrant, but to kill someone for self defense is considered right   when all and all they're exactly the same thing just different consequences "
it's not how many people you have around you that determines who you are  but instead it's who you hold closer to your heart and go home to that determines where your heart stands 
"anger can darken one's mind but when the one you love is beside you, you can see clearly  remember to hold those you care about close and never give into your darker emotions because your judgement shall always be clouded "
"sleeping alone more room for you, to sleep with the one you love is sharing everything you have including your heart "
"it's not how you take the shot, it's why you take the shot that matters in life  and always remember you can always come back to it later if you want to just be ready to take the shot when it presents its self to you "
"heroes aren't born or made, they're just the ones that stands up when the chips are down to lead the way "
"a leader isn't determined on how many medals they have or how far up in rank they are, a leader is determined by the person that is there when you need to be no matter how bad the situation is "
to lead is to follow and to follow is to lead  learn one before you try to do the other 
"to believe something is impossible then it will always be that way  to believe the impossible is plausible then it might be accomplished  to believe that the impossible is always possible, then you'll always achieve what you're looking to do "
"team work is like a piece of rope, one piece broken and then whole thing begins to fall apart  working alone is single shot rifle, better hope it works because it's not going to be easy  that's why you need a team that works together while being able to think alone "
look at the flames in a fire pit  each one is different and unique in their own way and each one is the same as well  they're beautiful to look at and yet deadly at the same time  this is how we humans are in life and fire is one of the best teachers of what we can do 
there's no fight impossible to win but there are some fights that need to be left alone because the enemy maybe more determined that what you believe them to be  always be sure of your choice of combat and pick your battles wisely because some are harder than others 
"you go to school most of your life to learn stuff that the education systems want to shove in your brain  but when you leave you come to understand that you never stopped learning, you just took on more subjects to study up on  life and nature - the real lesson plan of this world  you just get a little help understanding that from a text book "
"hold true to your self and your dreams and the people around you  and nothing shall be impossible, just a little difficult to get to because of the obstacles you've got to climb to get there "
stay the course and never back down  because the fight up hill is always hard but the fight to stay on top is even harder 
one bullet can determine more than just who is the <propfirst>  it can also change the fate of the world in more ways than one  nothing has ever been ended or started without a bullet being fired   the only difference is who the shooter was 
one part of the soul is good and the other is evil  one heart is pure and the other is tainted  but who can determine which is which by just looking at what is given?
well my passed away on saturday 20 march 2010  she laid in my arms for a long time shaking and trying to breath but her neck was severly crushed and i had to put her down  it hurts like hell but in the end i guess it was the right thing to do 
"i still will never forgive my self for taking her life although she would've passed slower in pain instead of quickly   but i had raised her from a baby pup, so she was like my own child "
"with every day though, is a new day and every day is a new bandage placed on the wound  if i ever find out who placed the dog house on her neck, then god best have mercy on them because i'm not  animals that you've raised a lot harder to say good bye to than a human being  mostly because humans control their outcomes and are able to be held accountable    animals are not "
"so as i move on and look at every day as another sun rise, i shall protect the innocent as i always have and the guilty shall pay  because the ones in the middle are the ones that suffer either way  rest in peace angel ol' girl and say hello to your mother in the after life as peace comes on to you  i'll see you when i get there and maybe then it'll be okay   "
"yin and <propfemale>, dark and light  good and evil, wrong or right  life is a fight you shall fight through day and night  so look to your left and look to your right, hold your head upright and grip your weapon tight  because the battle over the horizon, maybe the fight of your life "
"\every dog has its day dog  and today dog just ain't your's\"" - <propfirst> <propfirst>"""
it's not bullet that does the damage  it's the idea you can reach out and touch the enemy from hundreds of yards that makes them tuck tail and run 
feeling a lot better since the past few days  good to know that there are good people out there  good people help make good memories    good memories help keep you alive 
one round may take out one enemy but it makes the other hundred dunk and cover until further notice 
we wake up thinking today is just the same old thing just on another day   truth is that it's just another with a new story to tell 
"nature is like humanity   it lives, it dies, and it is given a <propmale> to start over    the only difference is that nature doesn't try to kill each other"
"live like tomorrow doesn't exist, sleep as if you haven't slept for days, enjoy the company of your loved ones, and pass your knowledge of life on to the next generation to follow in the hopes of it being passed on to other someday "
"the rifle makes the weapon  the human with the weapon makes the shooter  the one that proclaims freedom and peace, makes the path to the future "
"a warrior is made up of these ingredinents: trust, honesty, loyality, emotions, and dependability, and friendship  put these all together and you've got an unstoppable fighter on the battle field and off the battlefield you have a friend that'll always been there when you need them or when you ask them to be "
to fight and win is to do your job properly  to fight and die is to pass into the after life  but to fight in order to protect another life    no fight is known to be the hardest in life 
just because one person carries a gun and the other guy has a knife doesn't mean the knife is going to lose  it just depends on the situation and the opponent's reaction to who takes control of the chess board 
"life is hard but decision making is even harder  due in part to the fact that no decision is ever an easy one and every action no matter how good or bad, shall always have a consequence in the end  both consequences can be good or bad as well  just so long as it's the choice that you want and no one can change it, then it'll always be the right decision "
"when confronted in harm's way, there's always two choices  either fight or run   if you fight then show no fear and give it all you've got  but if you run, then be sure to always check your six to make sure there's no one else tagging along behind you "
be polite and kind to everyone you meet  but be sure to be ready for anything in response to some one else's stupidity  just make sure to make it quick and easy  wink 
"close quarters or long range, either way it's involving strategy just like a chess board  just make sure to think straight but move quick "
"stay loyal to the ones you love, stay strong to those you protect, stay proud of who you are, stay honorable in the battle   but most of all stay true too all your virtues within your soul "
"love your woman who is your one and only, love your family, love your self, and love life  but most of all, love the fact that you can protect them all when your fight is looking you right in the face "
one person up against twenty or thirty isn't called being out numbered  it's called having a challenge ahead of them 
just coming home to the one person you care about is enough to make a smile appear through the roughest of all days 
smile and be polite to everyone you meet but always be prepared for anything 
"a fight isn't just about violence or who is doing what  a fight is based on what's the reason violence is being used and who it's being used against  fight to only protect, never to destroy "
"honor, pride, wisdom, and skill   these are the four ingredients to a warrior's arsenal, the rest always come naturally "
take the fight to those that tell you that you can not  take the hand shake to those that say you can but you'll need help along the way  take the hugs to the ones that's there for you through thick and thin 
don't just assuming everything is going in your direction because there's always some one out there to come around and flank your open spots 
"the difference between the one you love and associates that you meet in the world is that the one you love will always be with your through thick and thin  associates, they'll find ways to ruin your reputation and your life if they can benefit from it in the long run "
"the only people i need in my life besides my self is my fiance, my family, and nature  other than that, people come and people go but those are the main ones that stay true to the cause and stay the course "
"live your life, love your woman and stay forever loyal to her, protect your family  forget the world "
"if you want to find the truth to all things under answered, then look in the mirror and you'll see where the answers start "
"dare to dream, dare to succeed, dare to win, dare to fight to the end, dare it and all and gain power  dare to love and you'll have everything "
"to be or not to be was the question asked to hamlet, my question is to live or not to live because either way it's all just a dream that can be the best we've ever had and don't want to wake up from or it can be a nightmare that we wish would just end and start back from the beginning "
"always stand your ground and hold strong because the fight to succeed is long and hard, but everything proves worth it in the end "

you can't put everything on the book and hope it all comes true   you've sometimes just got to stand up on your own two feet and face every challenge head on to see if the answer was already there 
"when one door closes another one opens, when the next door doesn't want to open, just strap a charge to it and blow it down then step in to inspect the next room  besides who knows, it might have just been worth alerting everyone else where you are "
"no challenge is ever easy   but sometimes the blood, sweat, tears, scars, and pain that comes with it may end up being rewarding in the end  fight for what you want in life and don't let anyone tell you that you never can because can't never could and never would  but can would, did, and will always "

"if you want questions, look to the books  if you want knowledge, look to the teachers  if you want to dream, look to the stars  if you want to hold all that is and shall be, look through your own eyes "
challenge the world in everything you do and never say never because nothing is ever impossible unless you make it that way  the only thing impossible is giving up 
"it's not the fight that is hard, it's the person fighting the fight that makes it hard  if you believe you can then you will   all you've gotta do is believe "

if someone is hitting on you with everything they have and you don't have nothing left to hit back with   that's not called taking a beating   it's called bapistism under fire because you've got to sit there and take it in order to survive and earn the world's respect
