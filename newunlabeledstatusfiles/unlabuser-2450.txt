"when my family and friends beleive in me, i have the opportunity to accomplish some amazing things   thank you    "
"is learning that sometimes the most aggressive form of persistance     is  <propfemale>  sometimes, we all just need a little space to grow into  ourselves "
"to all my christian friends,  if you don't know what to put on your about me section, share your story of faith and conversion to <propmale>  just an idea to pray about "
"life has tought me that every relatiohship whether it be church, business, friend, family, romance, marriage, etc has a beginning and end  some relationships last two days, three months, five years or till death do you part  just enjoying the moments from beginning to end makes every relationship worth it all, regardless of the time frame "
"when we know the deep  desires of our creator's heart, he allows us to speak into that very  deep place "
40 minutes to reserve two rooms for coachella this weekend     i wanted to pull my hair out but i think the woman helping me out worked in a prison     so that makes it ok 
thank you for all the birthday wishes  it is awesome to hear from each and everyone of you  god bless 
"ourdreams andhopes are constantly under siege inner demons are persistently reminding us of broken hearts and emotional scar tissues that <propfirst> our lives in this battle,success depends on acknowledging the pain,hurt or anger that feed the inner demons it requires us to not become emotional hermits but rather embrace friends that allow us personal transparency together,we will win many battles and create brighter days!"
"over\the years encouragement has taken on a new meaning for me \encouragement can be allowing people the opportunities and space to\discover their passion master their <propmale>  encouragement is more than\saying good job after the fact  it is saying \you have what it takes",\31f4f74ffd7d59401ec7f839ef1274c3,is hoping bonno heals up soon! he doesn't wont his u2 tickets to collect too much dust before they reschedule the show! yaya!!! yaya!!!
"spent the morning boating up and down the <propfemale> <propfemale> coast  next time, it is going to have to be jetskying and brunch!"
"by grace through faith my \no goes\"" become \""can does \"" not because of me but because of god's abundant grace!"""
positive perceptions create opportunities!
"issues of the\heart aren't black and white, yet so many people approach them that\way  issues of the heart are filled with the beautiful colors of\emotion and are best viewed through the lens of compassion and love "
is in turkey!
is in olympus     aka beach front tropical wonderland!
"live each moment with passion and purpose! tomorrow always comes with a price: less energy, one day older but never one day younger, and one less day to spend with those you love!   today is the day that the lord has made  i will rejoice and be glad in it!"
words can not describe the depth of my joy  today was action packed and tomorrow is filled with new adventures!
aribic is a lot tougher than mandrin in my humble opinion 
i didn't even realize i was watching tonight's sunset until it was over!
don't play leap frog with a unicorn 
"what is love? to some it is an ideal which drives their very being  to others, it is a commodity which they barter for  you have what i want and i have what you want  yet to others, it is a duty which must be worked towards  then there are those that feel love is made up of moments  today is and tomorrow may or may not be  whatever your take     (see comment for ending)"
"if someone says your dumb as dirt, just tell them dirt has been around a long time  smile "
"heavenly father, when people look at my life     let them see a person marked by your grace  nothing more and nothing less  amen "
"god's grace is like the sun and our mistakes are like a speck of dust  never let our mistakes dictate our relationship with him  but rather, focus on the fact that he loves us despite ourselves  and thus, we will always have access to his <propmale> grace! god loves you!"
"i believe the deepest love is marked by heart  today, when i heard my cuz say â€œmy boyfriend, whom i love,â€� i didnâ€™t really hear the words but rather the heart behind it  for some reason, when friends or family see our heart, they canâ€™t help but talk about! the deepest form of love has the same impact on each and every person that comes into contact with it!"
it always amazes me how disarming and refreshing just a little genuineness can  smile 
"lsat until december 12, you are my sworn enemy! i will show no mercy  i will ravage through your pages! no question shall be able to avoid the mortal blow of my #2 pencil  your four sirens will not detour me from one true answer  lsat, bring your giants of reading comprehension and logic games  they too shall fail under the relentless methodical blows of my #2 pencil  you are a worthy foe but you will be defeated!"
"well waiting in line at starbucks, the cuttest little girl come over to where i had placed my bible on a table and started thumbing through it  as soon as i noticed her from the line, i thought to myself     \i wonder if her mom knows she is reading the bible \"" my guess is she was probably just looking for pictures  smile  i couldn't help but watch with a huge grin on my face """
"walking styles: there is frumpy shoulder syndrome  these are the people that let their arms and shoulders droop and dangle, bouncing along as they walk  second is the gliding nymph  like leaves carried on the wind, they turn their head and glide in that direction  last but not least is the peacocking chest! marked by heads held high and erect posture, their chest leads the way "
where did all the leaders go? leaders create jobs  leaders build solid homes and families  leaders aren't marked by apathy but vision  they don't fear responsibility   where did all the leaders go?
back to the 90s with weezer! pinkerton tickets locked and loaded!
"dating in la is like a bartering system  you have what i want and i have what you want  if it works out great! if not, no hard feelings  the tragic truth is that this form of dating leaves apathy in its wake  people become better at building card house relationships while losing their ability to be transparent and vulnerable  everyone has a deep capacity for love  find people that inspire you to love deeply!"
the truth is a like any medication  too much of it can kill you  it is so easy to speak the truth in hurt or hate  we say everything and anything that comes to our mind while stripping the poor recipient of their dignity  speaking the truth in love is deferent  it gives just enough truth to help a person grow  it allows people to retain their dignity and opens the doors for more truth to be eventually shared 
"love is an oxymoron   it is like a puzzle that takes two people to finish   yet completing it isnâ€™t always easy  to get a full picture, people must bring different pieces to the table  vulnerability is the giving and receiving of these new pieces  figuring out where each piece goes takes work  but when the pieces that appeared to have nothing in common come together, a full image is revealed  this is loveâ€™s paradox "
"sometimes words can't e playful ress the depth of god's roots in our heart  we haven't heard an audible voice  seen our saviors pierced hands, feet and side  yet god's roots of love can run so deep in our live that it constantly surprises me!"
there is no room for doubt when we are looking forward to the end product of faith in our lives!
"\rejoice with them that rejoice and weep with them that weep \"" ro1215\",31f4f74ffd7d59401ec7f839ef1274c3,"\thank you lord for being faithful! you hear our prayers and answer them in your own special way!\"" amen"""
seeking god's grace can be a very humbling e playful erience!
invested in my first stock today! this could be addicting!
"god has a way of leaving me speechless! learning to follow him is very different for following directions on google maps  following him requires <propfemale>, trust and an ability to be present with him in the now! his vision is supreme  i often feel like the only way to appreciate his big picture is by looking back with 20 20 vision  god is good!"
"the capacity to forgive only comes from god! when someone hurts us at our core because of pride, hate, hurt, immaturity, etc, what they have done for naught, god will use for good! looking forward to the goodness of god allows us the strength to forgive  smile "
just another day sharing the depths of myers briggs with random people at starbucks!
"relax, today is a new day  stop looking back  yesterday's problems have already started their journey down the river of time and will soon become a distant memory  start looking forward  look for une playful ected surprises that can only brighten your day  smile "
"to god, our hearts are like gardens filled with the sweet aroma of his handy work  we can find flowers of joy continuously blooming! trees filled with fruit casting comforting shadows inviting us to feed on his provision and offering shelter from the dayâ€™s harmful rays   we canâ€™t help but acknowledge that his mercies are renewed daily "
god's word is like a orchestral score  it moves our hearts and touches our souls! great musicians don't just learn to effortlessly play the music but <propfemale> to understand the essence of the music itself  god is calling each and every one of use to be great spiritual musicians  smile 
"as a great artist pours their heart and soul into their masterpiece, god's heart and soul of love is poured into our lives without restraint  his strokes appear at times to have no rhyme or reason  to us, his ways seem like more paint on an already cluttered canvas  but his artist vision is unique  when it is all said and done, we discover a breathtaking masterpiece drenched in the <propmale> colors of his abundant love!"
"there are days where god's blessings are so overwhelming that i can't help but fall to my knees with tears in my eyes and sobs of praise on my lips  filling my heart with a <propfemale> to anoint my saviors feet with these tears of joy, worship and thanksgiving!"
god's rewards are not measured by dollars and cents but rather renewed fellowship with him  the type of fellowship that allows for mended hearts and tranquil souls  the type of fellowship that inspires a joyful <propfemale> and speechless praise 
"the blessings of god are like little seeds gliding on the wind  at first we don't even notice them, but they are there  a little extra strength to get us through the day or a moment of rest to prepare us for life's journey  but overtime these little blessings begin to <propfemale> and their <propmale> aroma fill our hearts with renewed hope in him  embrace god's little blessings  smile "
"life has taught me that every relationship whether it be church, business, friend, family, romance, marriage, etc has a beginning and end  some relationships last two days, three months, five years or till death do you part  just enjoying the moments from beginning to end makes every relationship worth it all, regardless of the time frame   (mw 4 1 10)"
"if something in your life is stealing your joy, it isn't worth it  no matter how much you may want something, it isn't worth your god given joy!"
"god has blessed me with awesome friends! thank you for the birthday wishes! tonight, each and every one of you were mentioned by name and specifically lifted up in my prayers  smile "
"in honor of mother's day i'm trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother & keep it there til may 9  if you will like this idea, please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many beautiful mothers we can get on fb! thanks for the idea, <propmale> hippensteel"
"<propfirst> brother's hid their deceitful ways behind his coat of many colors! potiphar's wife hide her adulterous desires behind <propfirst>â€™s servants coat! but when our savior was crucified, the soldiers pulled his outer coat into pieces and cast dice for his inner coat  this leaves us with no coats to hide behind  this leaves us with no excuses before him!"
"to truly hear what others are saying, we can't just listen with our ears and eyes but rather with our heads and hearts "
"so i am sitting in my car resting before church  suddenly these little kids come running over to my car telling me \church is about to start!\"" what can i say     time for church smile """
broken hearts scotch taped together by the sincerity of another broken heart  never really healing but always hurting  trading one pain for another  continual promises of ease reinforcing the hopeless cycle of inner numbness leaving ones heart still scotch taped together 
"sentinels of hope stand tall  herald your majestic truths to those who are broken hearted  love, so pure, transforming broken hurting hearts into new radiant masterpieces  joy, so deep, emanating from places within ourselves that we never new existed  peace, so refreshing, that the minds many unanswered questions fade away without a second thought "
"competitive prayer warriors understand that when it comes to prayer, insider trading isnâ€™t illegal!"
"fishing with her eyes, i couldnâ€™t help but turn around and walk back towards her  where are you from? <propfemale>  are you here for school? no, just on vacation  my name is <propfirst>  whatâ€™s yours? nanon  after a few seconds of warm silence, i wished her well and went on my way  \well walking, it hit me! i had found a little grace, nanon, for my day  \the lord can use the smallest <propmale> encounters to brighten our days!"
"father, be with us like you were with <propfirst> when he was sent to prison  in every situation be with us and show us mercy! give us favor with those we work for   as they give us more responsibility allow them peace because of the fact that you are with us and in all that we do lord, please make it to prosper  as you didn't forget <propfirst>, please don't forget us now  amen (gen 39:21-23)"
"our god is faithful  when trials and tribulations come, we shouldnâ€™t just pray for godâ€™s help  we should pray for humbled hearts of praise  looking forward to the moment, when the storms have past and all we can say is â€œthank you lord! you did it again!â€�"

"\charm is more valuable than beauty  you can resist beauty but you can't resist charm\"" priceless"""
"how can you accept others feelings for you, if you can't accept your own feelings for them?"
"when god blesses us, it is for his honor and <propfemale>  at the end of the day the blessings belong to him  he can take them away just as quickly as he gave them! thus, whether god has given us a lot or little, we must seek his provision daily "
"today was a day that was marked by god's peace and joy for me and a lot of the people that i care about  on days like these i wonder if god is having an extra good day! ex: people being saved, hearts willing to worship, people taking a stand for him, saints meekly enduring sorrow, etc    i may just have to wait for heaven to find out! happy 4th!"
me: you have a very peaceful spirit   cashier: thank you  (with warm smile) me: what is your secret?           cashier: jesus (with huge smile)            me: amen!
god's blessings aren't measured by material gain or increased social standing  but rather by an increase in opportunities to serve him  the type of opportunities that he could have just as easily given to someone other than you or me  these are our blessings 
"we forget that we pray to a god that lives outside of time  just like prayers in our past can impact the future  prayers in our future can impact the past! thus, do not underestimate the power of prayer! today's sincere prayer is answered first outside of time  and then made into realty by the creator of time though the past present and future!"
"the lord hears our prayers and provides for them  what we view as a sincere need at a tough moment in time, he has already invested his foresight time and energy into answering  thus, we may have an urgent prayer tomorrow but he is already working on a solution today  how good is the god we adore!?!"
do we know what burdens bowed our savior's head? or what deep sorrows filled his heart? lord let us know you  let your burdens be our burdens and your sorrows our sorrows  may we pray just as fervently for the things that move your heart as we do for the things that move ours 
"our divine vocation is empowered by his grace! despite seasons in our lives, his favor will always allow our gifts and calling to be evident! the skills and talents that allow people to trust us in the good times are the same that allow them to trust us in the bad times  why? because our gifts and calling are sustained by our saviors favor and grace! eph 4:7"
"what god may take away today, pales in comparison to what he has for us tomorrow "
"god rewards those that diligently seek him  but what about those moments were we are seeking him but not so diligently? well luckily for us, we don't have to diligently seek to find him  all we have to do is seek and we will find! he will do the rest!"
every day feels like a sprint when you are building a business 
"when i became a christian, god gave me light  my eyes, which once glared through the darkness with ease, can now only see what is illuminated right around me  he tells me to move forward through the darkness  but future bends and turns along lifeâ€™s road, i donâ€™t always see  yet his light is good enough for me   the trials that await are no match for the abundance of his grace and the light we embrace "
"fighting for the high ground     takes courage! being the bigger person     takes courage! believing in ourselves     takes courage! pursuing our dreams     takes courage!  depending on someone else to give us the high ground, be the bigger person, believe in us, empower us to pursue our dreams     takes no courage at all!"
"the inner struggle between a personâ€™s capacity to love and the there lack of ability to commit can be crippling  the amount of courage and emotional iq required to walk this personal tight rope is immense! many have attempted and failed  finding the richest connections of their lives, leaving an indelible <propfirst> on their hearts, yet never lasting a lifetime  to those who have stood at this <propmale>, do not give up on love but rather be confident that today's loss is the reason for tomorrowâ€™s success!"
