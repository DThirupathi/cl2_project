"i can't believe i'm even using facebook    but anyway, i don't know what's on my mind  you can say i'm being whiny about crap but to be honest i have a lot to legitimately be annoyed about and really, i only have about two people i can talk to about my issues with  it sucks, and sometimes i don't like having to bottle up my feelings, but i can't trust anyone with my words right now  (to be continued)"
"it seems where ever i go, nuisance or trouble follows  i sometimes see it as a blessing rather than a curse, but i really don't care for constant noise  a part of me can't live without the activities i'm doing right now, but another part of me wants to sit down, relax, and have a cup of tea with a dear friend  i scrutinize myself everyday because i can't muster the courage    (to be continued)"
"   to tell people off when they're hurting me  do i need to be treated? no, but sometimes i wonder if i was a beagle in my past life, being abused by his master everyday but seemingly always going back to him to find love even if he was the most deranged, bitchy, disgusting, pile-of-filth human to ever be born  yeah, i'm exaggerating, sure, but that's what i feel like  (to be continued)"
"it's sad, but again, i deal with it  another thing is the fact that i'm in constant teeter with the fact that i'm just welling up with emotion and yet i can't really tell anyone about it because they wouldn't understand and, again, judge me and the way i feel  yes, i understand that these posts are public and all of you who are friends with me can see them, but i really don't consider you all    (to be continued)"
"   to understand because what i'm doing right now is not to make a point but vent my frustration to the internet  if i can't bother people in real life, then i'm certainly going to do it here because i know that there will be at least one person who sees this post and really, truly understands what i'm going through  (to be continued)"
"i can also really be honest here, too; i'm nervous about what tomorrow is going to bring  what is this supposed to mean to you? nothing, really, but i'm just going to put it out there that tomorrow might be the most stressful, nail-biting day of my life  insane, i know, but nevertheless stressful and nail-biting  (to be continued)"
"i guess you could say i'm a complicated soul, yes? well, anyway, i whined for the first time in a while  i feel great! also, i got a ps3 slim in the mail as a surprise birthday present  \\o  thanks for reading,  - lord mog"
