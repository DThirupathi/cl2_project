bored and dreading work like crazy tommorow
waiting like a good patient child on anything and everything to download just to listen to some music    > >

havent been able to get on since thursday and oddly enough there is barely anything going on    odd how when i was gone about 3 days i came back to 200+ recents

"its gonna be a long long weekend   \no details will be given so save the effort in commenting   "
"<(* *<)<(*  wink >(>*  wink > \\<propfirst> dance!!!"
nothing says weekend at dads like sitting down and doing nothing  -_-
what is it about a house that can make a person feel so isolated and sad?
"only 15 hours until i get to work my longest shift yet at subway \woo~   -_-"
woo i get to stay up till 4 doing random stuff    
"i feel really nerdy right now  \im watching <propmale> play asteroids with every website he pulls up while wearing an athf shirt x x"
absolutely nothing to do today x x
"]i think today i learned the one thing that annoys me more than anything else, when friends, family, strangers, and basically just people in general jump"
]to assumptions about a persons life based on something they may have heard and dont even know any details about  that is quiet possibly the most annoying
"] thing that there is, if someone doubts my ability to tolerate annoying things then they have never heard my ringtone -_-"
cannot believe how fast this week flew by 
ugh can't sleep    i can tell school is gonna be a long one today    
it was raining sideways!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
well when you tell your family that you believe different you get to see their true feelings 
how sad is it when the most exciting part of your day is driving a quarter mile to the bank to cash a small check -_-
thinking about just leaving   
"my house now has the one thing i hate most of all about computers    a webcam    these things are so creepy  oh yes for those of you with them know this, they are hackable  hence, creepyness "
finally off work for a few days but absolutely nothing to do 
"it seems the music selection for tonight is bullet for my <propfirst>  the poison\every song but tears dont fall  laugh "
i just witnessed 4 armed guards be brutally murdered with a broom -_-
on second thought increase that number to 20
hm  aprox 8 hours until next year    time to come up with a resolution 
the sky is really nice tonight  surprise 
i believe there a very few things in this world more beautiful than a clear night sky 
"   \they say i'm just a stupid kid, just a crazy radical   \   another generation x who somehow slipped up through the crack\oh, they'd love to see me fall but i'm already on my back\\so it goes in one ear and right out the other\people talkin' shit but you know i never bother\it goes to one ear and right out the other\people talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand   "
how odd that i sorta e playful ect some sorta negative reaction from that song post 
"mind in a thick haze\the heart is torn asunder\now sleep will not come\\ah haikus \something to think whenever you can't sleep "
wallowing within the depths of ones own mind to find a way to move on 
so who thinks school will be out tomorrow?
why do the good die young and the wicked live happily   
"i would just like to say, i hate my friend <propmale> for giving me a new addiction  damn you minecraft!"
"well ive learned 2 things\that no matter how much you fight yourself or try to trick yourself you will never win\and that music and chess are a weird combo "
\we like people for their qualities," but love them for their defects\""\"12d374c81ebf60bd6b778e79041791ee,woo 1 more day out!!!!!!  > > sarcasm~

"in love, in doubt, indoubtly in love?"

"something to think about    \is there a difference between honesty and the truth?"
almost time to go home x x
"your heavens trying everything, your heavens trying everything to bring me down "
why do people add everyone they know to their friends? why should they care what the random guy down the street has to say about his flowers -_-
"wow my neighbors are idiots  little kids just randomly running around in our yard > >\where are my rocks at      "
downloading 130+ songs at once     i forsee a computer dying soon 
"2 best shows ever, shameless and skins "
"just out of curiosity, has anyone ever seen the original skins? (not the mtv version)"
after 4 hours the music has finally downloaded with 0 viruses  laugh 
"found my new favorite quote today in a math class \\\untill you make peace with who you are"," you will never be content with what you have\""\"12d374c81ebf60bd6b778e79041791ee,"shake me down, not a lot of people left around, who knows now, softly laying on the ground~~~"
lol springer's facebook got banned by a facebook failbot > >

"no matter how much i say i hate working, i gotta say that i do really enjoy my job, its the people that make it enjoyable (people =coworkers not customers)"
"something to think about     if you were a tool, what kind would you be?"

i am so sick of my dads with his pissy ass girlfriend who always has this disgusted look on her face when im around  -_-
woo friday nights with nothing to do because adolf hitdad will get mad if i want to socialize
wouldn't it be amazing to just live outside the city in a house with a clear roof and just to be able to see all the stars?
"woo entertaining day\btw mongolia grill is awesome!!!"
woo bowling and sucking at it
"fun night with people lol\got owned at bowling too lol"
just gotta love hostility at home

wanting to sleep but to also stay up all night 
well      that was annoying 
idc if its 1 in the morning    feeling great and it's already looking to be a good day 
"amazing how a great day can turn terrible  side note, if you find yourself to be a pissy person after church not only are you a fake but you shouldnt take it out on the people who have to put up with your s*** and you should just go home and think about what a fake you are  now im done raging "
wow trade school sucked 
"empires built around your heart, let the right one in   "
i need therapy -_-
i want to leave   
why do the worst things happen to the best people?
lalalalala boredom
"well i quit mabi\anyone who really knows me knows what that means "
hit hit hit hit  bust  fold

"\there's someone for everyone\"" -facepalm- -facepalm- -facepalm- small amount of advice to people\",12d374c81ebf60bd6b778e79041791ee,i swear if my dad did what i think he did im going to kill him

what to do what to do x x
what is it about life that's so depressing     
how much longer to disappear   
having second thoughts -_-
hm 16 years and ive only met 2 people who aren't fake 
"life is like a chilled spring day  most people are cold but stay content with it  but deep down everyone wants a greater warmth  sadly enough though, it seems like those people that think they've found the warmth they've so desperately seeked just get burned by it  so if your one of the people who has found that perfect warmth try to keep it as long as you can and never let it go "
insincerity was the best band tonight hands down
"half drunk rednecks make me wanna rofl \\\you looking at me funny?\""\",12d374c81ebf60bd6b778e79041791ee,has anyone else noticed that if you have an awesome friday the rest of the weekend is boring?
"oh boy school tommorow\hmm       prom is this week   "
never a dull moment with a bunch of overemotional hormonal teenagers -_-
"wow everyone is so disgustingly tan now\so fake looking "
to know everyone's given up on you is a huge relief but also an emotional burden   
floating down the river of lonely to drown in a sea of regret   
i swear the teachers here are idiots and can't even make a study guide right
man im a sucker for pretty eyes lol
"prom was pretty good\better than i thought lol"
bleh another weekend gone
my dog just found a knife and brought it to us lol
everyone's got friends friends friends friends
just another year in this forsaken hell hole till i can leave - -
