"ugh     it's not crack, but it's just as e playful ensive and addicting! looks like i'm gonna have to buy a water filter after all  lights are gonna be a few hundred extra, i'm gonna need a couple hundred for a skimmer     might as well spend a half k on a controller  ah    but what if i wanna put a sump under the tank    hmm    yeah, i'll just sell my stuff for money  that'll work    huh?  i have an essay due tomorrow?"
"\how much longer is this going to take?\""\",f867ada0153c6d420ee3bbc7af53b0fd,just added a ton of photos      those were fun picking through   
"if i don't get on facebook tomorrow, it's because i broke my brother "
   i think i lost my schedule
"i have now made it my quest to invalidate anything that i feel others follow and see fit, to take humanity, turn it inside out, and leave its rotting core in the open  i will shatter ancient maxims and make supposed geniuses appear stupid in my wake "
the most beautiful girl i've ever seen   
would you risk everything you had for a person? would you make the ultimate sacrifice if you could   ?
"what should i do now? \if i sit back and wait, it might just turn out to be too late  \but if i'm too early, it might fail and turn out a disaster     "
"heh  they should totally rename high school football games  people were just starting fights for the heck of it  i felt terrible though  i was probably the shortest kid there, and i only knew a few people, and i looked out for them  intently  despite looking terrible, feeling terrible, and being trampled on, i think it was worth it  smile "
"\the only test you truly can't study for is divine judgment  live your life with no regrets\"" -myself"""
only one thing matters now 
ha ha!!! i laugh at all you people that play cod and have xboxes   
how do you let someone know    that you're dying inside   ?
"awh    i really don't know how it could get any worse for me  playful  i'm getting laid off from my job, the people i care most about won't talk to me    i wonder what comes next?  laugh "
oh dear god i hope you're not talking about me   
"failed that ap euro test  i'm pretty sure i did  i never e playful ected to have to take school seriously and study! i'm probably the only one who doesn't study for anything in my classes, and i'm gonna have to if i don't wanna fail "
the world that was transparent     
if i ever get a fennec     smile 
"confused    what have i\ done wrong? what have i done at all!?! i can't even live life honestly \because i'm holding in all this emotion, all this hurt  my mask is \broken  i can't hide it anymore  i just wish somebody would tell me what\ i've done wrong  is love really that bad a sin   ?"

man i don't even know what to put here anymore   
"yeah, i'm almost thinking about not going to tbs tomorrow "
"wow  mr  stallings basically e playful lained my entire life story, and he e playful ects me to be able to just walk away from the problem    i can't  i'm not    strong enough "
"i won't walk away  for ten months    for almost ten months i've pretty much dedicated my life for this  what does it all count for if i just turn around and leave? as much as i try, i can't live life without thinking about her  it's like trying to wipe away paint with an eraser  go ahead and try  tell me how it works out for you "
"you know what? i get it  i have for weeks  you don't like me  i just don't know why you couldn't tell me that instead of leaving me scratching my head in depression about why you ignore me  for ten months i've held everything in, and it took me just that long to realize what a waste it all was  i'm just done crying about what wasn't meant to be  i know i have to move on  but know this    i will always love you "
"totally thinking about changing my <propmale> to programming or computer science  or if i get to year two in culinary, i'll just have a double <propmale> "
"yeah, forget culinary  i'm going to be a computer geek when i grow up  playful "
"i puked my guts out on the bus and missed school  i feel terrible for the guys who sat around me  the worst part is probably going to be making up a test and several quizzes, and now i'm essentially two days behind in algebra 2 because i was taken out early on wednesday    school's gonna be fun tomorrow "
"ok  yeah, that's really awesome guys    ignore all my messages and stuff  my gosh it feels like freaking <propfemale> vu all over again, except this time it's with everybody else "
and so i can conclude from e playful erience that formspring is an evil place  be careful about what goes up there  it could really mess with people   
someday    
won't be on the computer again until friday night 
"i'm not afraid anymore  i've been through too much to be afraid  i really don't care if the whole world knows  for all the time i've lost that i should have put into school or my friends, i really don't care what i lose now; i'm on a suicide mission  what's left to lose anyway?"
"everytime i feel like i've resolved a problem, it just goes and blows up in my face again  maybe i should aim for something with stability, like becoming a zen master or whatever "
"everywhere i  turn there's some kind of problem  when i turn away from one, another one just runs up and punches me in the face  i wish i could just close my eyes and make them all go away   "
fair was alright  couldn't have been any better though 
"i'm done  i can't take it anymore  i just wanted to be your friend and somehow that makes me a stalker  my most personal feelings are a joke  gosh you won't even look at me  what happened? you laugh at me, and i'm struggling to figure out why  i'll never understand why you hate me so much because people are too busy laughing to tell me why  i just can't wait until the day your name puts a smile on my face   "
"i stayed awake thinking about you more than i slept  when i did sleep, i dreamt about you  when i dazed off at school, you were always on my mind  i wanted you, and only you  you were the world to me  i'd have given up everything for you, even life itself  too bad it's taken me ten months just to realize you want nothing to do with me  i'm sorry, <propfemale>  good luck finding another guy who loves you as much as i did "
"i have finally realized what is truly imporant in life  mr  stallings, it may have taken a while, but you have showed me the love of god, the only love i will ever need, and i have you to thank for that  god has given me the strength to break free of that which restrained me; i can now enjoy my life the way it was meant to be â€ "
new kicks  laugh 
?????????????????????????
"for the first time in literally months, i feel great  skullcandy screwed up my headphone order, so they're sending it to me along with a whole bunch of other free stuff with first class shipping  i also got an 89 on an algebra 2 test that almost everybody else failed  yeah, i guess i could say i'm doing alright  playful "
"i am never eating that again  i don't know what it was, or when i ate it, but i know i'm never eating it again  annoyed "

science    just man's way of understanding how god works  maybe that's why i like it so much  laugh 
well this sucks   
"without god, man would destroy himself  for this reason, god instilled intelligence upon a select few to see that this does not happen  in return, the devil unleashed ignorance upon the world to balance this  without intelligence, man then becomes primal  without ignorance, man then becomes enlightened; without man, however, the two create evil "
"mr  stallings has highlighted the most important issue in my life  i would rather be shot, stabbed, punched, and beaten rather than somebody i care about hurt me with words  however, even more painful than words is a lack of them; silence is the most painful thing i can think of  if you didn't know you were killing me inside, now you know  you know my weakness; please don't abuse it "
"sick night with <propfirst> mcgregor  you're welcome back anytime, man "
question for anybody who cares to answer    what are the best headphones?

"ugh    - - it's a vicious cycle, and it's happening all over again "
stuck on another bus    that's cool  i'll just sit here while nobody talks to me  then i'll get home and    probably do nothing 
"time    that final, ethereal dimension    time stops for nothing and nobody  i am no exception  i have often fallen victim to the wrath of time, trapped within my own mind, e playful loring the errors of the universe; these e playful editions bred cynicism, and while i dwelled upon my own misery, that unforgivable temporal dimension continued to flow  i am now left    with a terrible abyss    that only somebody beautiful can fill "
tomorrow's gonna be funnnn  an ap euro test followed immediately after by an algebra ii test    oh yeah  sometimes i miss being a freshman - -
"   the break is here, but what good is it all if the one thing i truly want for christmas    i can never have   ?"
"yesterday    probably could not have gotten any worse  the tea was the most embarassing thing i have ever done  we walked around aimlessly for the following four hours, then when we finally got home, i tried to sleep but i couldn't  i've basically been laying in bed for 18 hours  then my dad came in and said we were all going to <propfemale>    what fun "
and    i'm in <propfemale> 
i'm back! from    <propfemale>  ah nobody cares i was gone anyway     sad 
i wonder     what my parents are gonna get me for christmas if i haven't really asked for anything yet 
"happy birthday, jesus!"
worst christmas ever? yeah i think so 
"and to finish my lovely christmas holiday, i got sick for 4 hours and then threw up all over the bathroom  i spent about 22 hours in bed yesterday and i can't get out of it now  i'm sooo sore   "
easily    the most awesome place i've ever been 
ohhh     the haircut  i literally lost pounds of hair  it's gonna take a while to get used to this one   
"i'm narrowing down my equipment options, and the total cost of it all  i'm going to need to drill my tank with a holesaw though if i want to set up a sump, which i'm gonna have to make completely by hand  to cover costs though, i'm selling anything i can get my hands on  this includes my video games     however, if anybody wants to make an offer on them, tell me  i have friend discounts  laugh "
"i just want to stop and forget it\i don't want to imagine or feel it\i just want to heal this broken heart of mineâ€¦\\after my voice was swallowed up by the angry wind\something else emerged from my fears\canâ€™t you remember it? that sky of tears   \\before i am crushed by this mighty world\i just want to say one thing- \donâ€™t ever look at me againâ€¦ and think that it doesnâ€™t sting\\your pain is always with you "
"algebra 2h test tuesday    this is by far the scariest thing i've faced all year; even more intimidating than the newspaper, the position paper, and the satire  i've really got my hands tied on this one  i'm gonna be studying all day and all night just to even pass this thing  wish me luck, guys "
studying for the algebra 2h exam of death    feel free to distract me by texting me  laugh

"oh, and i have some turtles that need a new home  i did my best with what i was given, so they're not in the best of shape  that's why they need a new owner to love them  i have 80 or so pictures of them laying around in my photos  please help them find a better home  laugh "
even broken clocks can tell the right time   
undeniably smitten ?
if only i could fast-forward to tomorrow    it's been eating me alive since sunday- i'll never make it 
"i try to drown my troubles in music, but they're awfully good swimmers and the songs aren't nearly deep enough "
"again i am presented with a problem i have no control over    all i can do is think about it  for me, it's just another test to see how long it takes for me to crack "
"and just like that, i'm on my own, like an eagle flying through a <propfirst>  i can't give up  though the path to the calm sea i search for is littered with bleeding winds and lightning, the serenity of the lagoon calls louder than the thunderheads  after all, what can quiet love?"
"i'm like a fox; unlike most people, the longer i wait, the surer i am about something "
"waiting!    probably all i'm gonna do this weekend  ah well, at least the week ends on a happy note  playful "
i    just had the best dream ever about the most beautiful person ever  i just hope it all comes true 
i've found something     brighter than the sun  smile 
"tomorrow's a beautiful new day  i opened a 41 oz  bag of skittles after dinner  i'm getting eight hours of sleep tonight, twice more than yesterday's four  i may have failed that ap test by not studying, but i also might not have  laugh  for once in literally an entire year, i feel optimism, and it feels wonderful  as of today, i strike down any cynicism that dares enter my path!!!"
"now hopefully, i can finally do it before next week  i refuse to wait another weekend  laugh "
"you have to take the initiative! the things you want done most    they're not going to do themselves! go not where life takes you, but where you take your life  seize what can be taken, because the regret of not doing something is far worse than the pain of failure  how will you know you didn't succeed until you try?  laugh "
oh wow    that's the last time i taste the rainbow for a while   
"well, i played some video games last night for the first time in probably a month, and it just wasn't as fun as it used to be  guess i've found better things to do "
"pumped for superbowl sunday! even though all i'm gonna do is watch the commercials and stuff my face with food, at least it will make up for the terrible weather from yesterday  i mean seriously, why does the good weather have to be when we're inside all day   "
green bay! takin' care of business!  laugh 
the green bay packers    have won the super bowl! boo-yah!

"i think i might stay home tomorrow  i may have caught something, the likes of which my immune system has not yet seen  if i really am sick, this will be the first time in a couple years "
"my antibodies    they're like little ninjas: they killed off whatever i had overnight  however, they can't do squat about this massive headache from getting my braces repositioned  seriously, people i don't know are being payed thousands of dollars to put metal in my mouth; can't they at least make it hurt a little less?"

"e playful lain to me this happiness, this amazing feeling,\so unfounded by reason, but perfect in meaning \why it messes with my head and plays with my mind,\why it teases my soul and makes me blind \itâ€™s cold like the <propfemale>, and lighter than none,\yet brighter than the stars and warmer than the sun \the greatest thing iâ€™ve ever felt, this wonderful mysteryâ€¦\what is this beautiful thing, glowing inside of me?"
   it's amazing how quickly things can just completely turn on their heads  yesterday i was the happiest and most hopeful guy in the world  right now you can't possibly bring me lower  why is a single sentence allowed to have this much power   
went to bed at 7 yesterday and got up at 10 today  got a bunch of new clothes and bought a $400 watch  shadowed with awesome people at an awesome restaurant and stuffed my face with great food all day    today could have been awesome if yesterday never happened

"   this weekend's more ruined than the last one  the weather tomorrow is going to be amazing, but i've talked to probably six people and everybody seems to be busy, so i will be spending it alone  on top of that, i left my culinary arts uniform in 4th block today so i can't go to the chef's feast on sunday! i wish i could just go to sleep right now, and wake up monday morning and go to school   "
my weekend is salvaged!!! i got my uniform! see you guys at the chef's feast!!
"   why  why are my most personal secrets, the things i've done that are most important to me    why is something that only a few people should know about floating around like dust in the wind, like anybody's business?"
"dude  possibly the best night ive ever had  sullivan mcelveen,elisabeth gevers,chandler hulsey,brittney jamison,daniel comen and <propfirst> reilly  if i didnt tag you, its not because i forgot, its because i dont care ate the best food, <propmale> with the coolest peeps, and cruised down the highway at 80 blasting tunes  oh yeah!!"

ugh    bite me 
"it's midnight  it's pitch black outside, and the light still burns  i can hear through the walls  it can't get any quieter; it's still too loud  i've thought all these same thoughts over in my head a thousand times, and i never get anywhere; i can't make sense of it  it hurts  i hate this   "
"it's always with me  that fatal, damning piece of paper    i don't need it to remind myself how, not for the first time, my life was turned completely on its head  it must be my fault, then  after all, it's not the first time i've aimed higher than i can reach, like a kid with a slingshot trying to hit the stars  after a month with nothing to move on to, what the hell am i supposed to be doing?"
"let's go back  i want to start over, all the way from the beginning  if i could remember just one thing, it would be all the mistakes i've made  that way i would make sure i never messed up  of course that's not possible, though  if i can't solve my problems and i can't erase them from happening, what should i do?"
don't know when or who with: just know i'm showing up at iop tomorrow and walking around  i'm sick of si  nobody comes there 
on iop!
"what a unique e playful erience, and an almost complete waste of 6 hours  the only things i got out of that was some sun, $14, and some foot pain  walking from iop all the way to my house sure was different "
"it's not like i don't know you anymore, it's like i never knew you in the first place  i just can't make the tiniest bit of sense out of you  there are so many questions i have that start with 'why'  i thought and thought until it finally dawned on me that it's no use trying to answer them by myself  who    are you?"
"ok, either my phone is retarded, or something else is up  i'm hoping it's the former, but i don't know for sure and it's really ticking me off "
"fleeing from something i can't escape, chasing something i'll never reach    forwards, backwards, no matter which direction i take, i can't make it \end it  i can't take it anymore  that goofy kid you used to know died  my mask is broken "
"if i could run, i would make it\if i could fly, iâ€™d never come back\i aimed for those white, white clouds\if i break through, i know iâ€™ll make it,\break through to that blue, blue skyâ€¦"
"i'm confused  the weather in charleston has turned to crap  i don't care how cold it gets, i am not wearing pants  i thought i was gonna take it easy next year, but i guess not  mr  crosswell hunted me down today in class and found out i was taking prob and stats next year  he made me sign up for honors pre cal    this is dumb  i wanted to try all cp but i guess it's all honors next year instead   "
"what kind of messed up world do we live in    i look around me and see a pothead in front of me, a cokehead beside me, and a drunk behind me  we are all self-deluded that because we want something, we will get it  not the case  and when we don't get it    look what we do to ourselves  i wonder everyday how i'm not one of those people "
"nothing's changed  after all that's happened, everything still feels the same  i hate this   "
