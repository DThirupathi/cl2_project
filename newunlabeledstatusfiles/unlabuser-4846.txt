"the menagerie\ e playful ands "
relived i can only seem to e playful erience so much turmoil in a day 
going to mow a lawn  ?

"(unliked) that see who views you profile wants you to do surveys, which need your cell # to text you the results   even if you play the game and ignore the spamware the installer throws in, it takes you to a <propfemale> where you have to sing up and put this thing on your fb profile and it tells you who clicks that how often   junk "
"if i could, you know i would\if i could, i would\let it go\\this desperation\\dislocation\\separation\\condemnation\\revelation\\in temptation\\isolation\\desolation\\let it go\and so fade away\to let it go\and so fade away\to let it go\and so fade away\i'm wide awake\i'm wide awake\wide awake\i'm not sleeping\oh no"
so i caught a very interesting fish today

"i guess this is a good opportunity to attempt this in a positive light  a fine present from everyone would be to finally begin addressing me normally  caveman served its purpose 3 years ago when i went to dishs as a good handle, but is now catalyzing my social alienation  actually i've despised its abuse for many months  i don't e playful ect perfect results, but i'd rather not resort to the opposite of my 1st sentence "
i love this time of year when it gets cool and the flavor of fall is in the air 
"i'll have to get some more, this is the last one i have right now "
"is again caught up with bleach, the anime at least "
"i'm beginning to hate facebook   it's sadly the best way to communicate \casually with people who aren't close enough (physically or \relationally) for you you to see in person   it collects information \from everyone and advertisers can use this to their advantage "
"sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   all of a sudden    \\ffr is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

makin stavin snow forts with <propfirst> and <propfemale>
i now communicate with more caution where i used to interact with more awesome   my awesome must have burnt out over time   but i still have a grasp   along with this my thoughts veer to the conclusion that not feeling judged is probably the healthiest thing for this 
"there is the truth the truth, trust me, there is  perhaps one of us knows it better than all the others, perhaps none of us is even close  but it's there  i am trying to search for it  not the entirety, that's too ambitious, but one piece at a time  always keep open the possibility that what you take as true may not be  keeping all possibilities open but knowing only one is actually true, that is critical thinking "
goodbye 2010
i'm not quite leaving for good tomorrow like i thought   i'm only leaving for a couple days then in a few more days i'll leave for a long time

"ethics reading seems enjoyable enough  though the sociology book is big and fat, it's not even close to the osha book of general industry regulations, that book promises to be the most boring by far   the english book is small, not so much as ethics, but it is   english seems like the most homework though, and is far from my favorite subject "
