"let's see who truly reads my status: you and i wake up in a small, purple volkswagen <propfemale> together  we're wearing stormtrooper costumes and have a <propfirst> o'lantern, a digital camera, five 10-sided die, and a large jar of peanut butter  using three words          what would you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this to your status       so i may comment on yours as well  be a good egg and play along  (3 words is harder than you think!)"
ok well its time to shower then head out to give my bunnies away then go to davids bridal and hope they take pitty and either give me my 100 deposit back or some store credit  then its off to <propfemale> <propfemale> faircloth house to make a checklist of things that i need to do for this move we are about to go through  wish me luck
