"i'm lost like gorilla <propfemale>, but i know imma find my way!"
every ghost has his day
thinking   
looking before i leap   
"feelings are like energy, they cannot be lost nor gained, they simply change form "
"time, love, and money; at one point in my life i was struggling to understand the concepts of these, now i have so much of them, the struggle is to figure out who to give what to "
"work like you have never had money, run like you have never tripped, love like you have never been hurt, live life like you will die at midnight  i am tired of postponing things and watching procrastinators, when i wake up tommorrow, i am finally going to do something that i should have done along time ago   "
"they say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes are wide open because a dream is kin to my last breath   "
