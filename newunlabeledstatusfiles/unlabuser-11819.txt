"can <propmale> truly separate you from friends    if you want to be with someone you love, aren't you already there?"
"you say you'd be here when i fall\now i'm falling 100 stories\but you don't see me at all\you just turn away and ignore me\\and did you even think of all\of this pain that you're putting on me?\and i    i can't stop myself from falling"
"all i ever wanted was a \one life stand\"" with you"""
what appears to be the end may really be a new beginning 
giving up doesn't always mean you are weak; sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go

â€œbeing happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect  it means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections â€�

"i turned & left, told myself, i could be as bad as someone else  but i found it hard, when an angel's on my right     but you held my hand, and took me right back down to hell  i have an angel on my shoulder, but a devil in my head "
a best friend wont ask questions      they will already know 
weave in faith and god will find the thread
"when you are in love and you get hurt, itâ€™s like a cut    it will heal, but there will always be a scar"
"just sittin here laughin at what you said that \i'm mean\"" hahahaha naw nigga i was just being honest but if you want i show you mean """

"i love you not only for what you are, but for what i am when i am with you  i love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me  i love you for the part of me that you bring out "
the show goes on!
