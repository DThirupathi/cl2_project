"sometimes we e playful ect more from others, because we would be willing to do that much for them "
off to maxfund had alot of fun at the races last night  will post some pics later!
"got mood poisoning, must be something i hate"
this is going to be a long day
"up until now i had sworn to myself that im content with loneliness, because none of it was ever worth the risk  you are the only exception "
"god <propmale> me the courage not to give up what i think is right, even though i think it is hopeless\ "
"` just when you thought you had it all, it all falls apart "
"you ever have one of those days where no matter how many times you turn left or right, you keep slamming into an 'effin wall?"
food  sleep  work  repeat   sad 
getting my hair done at snip snip!!!
"that part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today  the old me's dead and gone today "
the quiet scares me cause it screams the truth  annoyed \
"ive got a bulletbroof heart, youve got a holowpoint smile"
"i will let you down\i will make you hurt"
"no i didn't just run into the pole, it just looked like it needed a hug"
"men have always said \why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\"" updated info for you men on why women don't want to get married  \""why buy the entire pig just to get a little sausage?\"""""
"honestly, you dont want to know what im thinking      "
"somtimes good things fall apart, so better things can fall together  \never give up hope  smile "
and the soup of the day: cream of bullshit                   i hate liars
"love, hate, fear, passion  its all the same, either way you get hurt     annoyed "
"some people should cross bridges, some should burn them and then theres some who need to jump off them  need a push?"
"although we pray for serenity to accept the things we cannot change, i continually strive for strength and courage to change the things i cannot accept   "
is trying to hold herself together when in all reality has already fallen apart
"i walk around with a smile on my face, but underneath are the lonely tears that only come out at night after everyone goes to sleep   "
"tomorrow is assumed by all of us, but promised to none of us"
that was pretty amazing   
dammit
sometimes we e playful ect more from others because we would be willing to do that much for them 
"change only happens when the pain of holding on, is greater than the fear of letting go "
any second could be the second that changes your life
