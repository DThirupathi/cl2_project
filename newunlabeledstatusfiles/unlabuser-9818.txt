i'm such an idiot sometimes   
why do i question myself? i'm split down the center and i can't stitch it back together   
life sucks   and i just want to be away from it all   forever 
inbox me something you have always wanted to tell me or ask me  make this your status and see what you get  > > ;
can someone shoot me?
"hine mauger , i feel like i've either hurt you or our friendship   maybe it's\ just me over thinking   i just want to let you know i'm sorry for \anything and everything i have or may have done  *bow*"
it's fine  (woohoo inside joke    thingy)
i'm confused   how can you be melancholic and somewhat happy at the same time?
it's good to hear the rain again   it brings back a feeling that i haven't felt in a while 
i can't take it anymore   it hurts too much   i'm tired of being ignored   tired of noone caring  tired of life   i have no reason to live   so why should i   
"i'm okay, back to school on monday @ @"
had an amazing night day c:
"for some odd reason i feel empty   or brainless  either way, it's not good  annoyed "
"i've got a headache as usual, can't think straight, can't focus on anything, can't do much   and i don't know why  is it because i miss her   or is it something else? who knows "
"should i live or die   i see pointlessness in both aspects, but there are few things that sway me to living, and those people know who they are  thanks to everyone who's making life worth living, especially one person in particular   love "
"had an awesome day with friends (thanks to <propfirst> g-man colobong, <propmale> lonas-demps, keichi '<propfirst>' hiru, & <propfirst> rashod hodges)  , ice shooting wars will began again next time   hopefully "
well everything is fucked     just fine and dandy    
so life   when will you not take every <propmale> to reach into my chest and rip out the contents?
so    aside from my world crashing down and falling apart around me   is there anything to look forward to? cause i don't really see anything in the future   that can kick me out of this drag 
"so   anyone have an idea when the world will stop fucking me over? when will it stop taking my hopes, my wishes, my feelings, my everything   dump it on the ground and then proceed to set it ablaze?"
"i have a message \please refrain from talking to me, i'm not stable \-miserable, hurt, betrayed, lonely-\welcome to my life   "
"you're killing me slowly   and you don't even know it \i have this feeling in my heart, and just sometimes i don't want to submit \but i can hope, i can dream, that maybe one day   feelings will return to me \but i guess   i'll just have to wait and see \i just have to believe \(yeah i suck at poetry and stuff  but eh   it was just thought up on the spur of the moment)"
is bored out of his mind   and wants to try and meet new people   maybe then i'll find someone 
who agrees? life    sucks   
i need to die   anyone willing to help or do the deed?
"text me  laugh \706-536-9285"
had an amazing night thanks to someone~!
why do i destroy everything good that happened to me? why can't i be happy with what i got?    i just ruin everything 
doesn't know what to think anymore   
doesn't know what to do   
i can't trust anyone   
my life sucks    how about yours?
"sometimes   i want to be more outgoing  but why do i feel so empty, when i do sometimes?\so   maybe i need to talk more   if you want to talk feel free to message me for my # \   i feel like being more talkative to people today "
"heart full of woes, forever   dwindling   gone \one by one they take it apart, pick   scratch   crush \the endless cracks surface,blurred   existing   visible \forever is the pain,ache   pulsating   chronic \maybe there is hope for me,wishes   dreams   nothing \for the shadows of the heart,lurk   grow   and    destroy \\yup    "
"every\ person has 1000 wishes, a cancer patient only has one: to get better  i\ know, that 97% will not post this as their status, or even acknowledge \it  be one of the 3% to like it, and put this as your status, at least \for an hour, and show your support for those who died because of cancer,\ suffered because of cancer or are still fighting it"
it's official   i don't believe in love   unless someone can prove to me otherwise  we are all too selfish to love one another  and the few that aren't are plagued with turmoil   and pain 
is suicide the answer? you tell me   
"do i dare live another day?\plagued by all these pains   \i don't want to stay\let the blood drop and maintain stains\in this world so cruel,\i see nothing there for me \i'll just take the path of the fool \i'm too blind to see   \the good, the worthwhile, and the love \so i bid thee farewell, my friends, family, and 'love' "
"someone text me or something  sad \i'm bored, lol \if you need my # feel free to send me a message \i need to be more social anyway   "
shoot me now  please?
who would think forgetting to take a pill would have this dire of consequences on my general psyche 
life sucks   
damn parents   why can't they just let me die   
tis depressing staying in a movie theatre lobby   the endless amounts of people having fun   and me? sitting alone in a corner 
i don't know what to do anymore 
i'm so confused   
"i find myself enjoying things, just to fall in a downward spiral over and over  why do i bother sometimes?"
"so in the end it's nothing but a self-imposed sentencing, a self-inflicted pain  perhaps it means nothing to you, but everyday i feel pain, turmoil and crippling sadness  is this my own doing   perhaps so, but i can't get past my thoughts of you  so, what is the solution to this eternal problem that plagues me?"
"i can't see my future  i feel like i'm slowly fading away, only to be forgotten as time goes on  i have no one to anchor my placement in this world  maybe one day i'll just fade into oblivion "
i'm getting tired of everything   and does anyone want to do something?   i'm bored out of my mind    
i hate my life  no questions   i hate it 
anyone willing to talk to me?
"this week could not get any worse   oh wait it has  \also new phone so i need some <propfirst> again   "

uber happy to uber sad in 10 sec  is that a new record?
i feel like doing the whole q&a thing so feel free to message me questions and i'll truthfully answer them 
"feel free to text me, just message me on here and i'll give you the#"
and there i go losing another best bud   just like that 
some one ask me some questions? q&a please? all askers will be anonymous 
"i'm striving to change myself for better or for worse \hopefully at the end of this tunnel, 'll like whom i've become \if not, well it's back to the drawing board  annoyed "
q&a feel free to message note me questions  i'll be glad to answer them  your name will not be disclosed when i post them up 
"so, anyone else starting to feel like utter shit?  laugh "
you know what? fuck life!!! what has it done for me? bring me nothing but pain and heartbreak 
feeling better   have a new outlook on life  i must push foward 
anyone want to talk or hangout sometime this week? i'd really like to  annoyed 
"anyone want to hangout this week, i need to try and get more social  annoyed \working bloody hard to > 3<\so if anyone wants to, please feel free to inform me "
\what's faster? the bullet, \c8c0e34420e46041a2356aaf827196f1,why do i feel happy   or good   yet empty?

"i need something to do, somebody to <propfemale> with   any takers?"

"gawd why!??!\i have five pages barely   and not the five \full\"" pages mrs  <propfirst> is looking for   fml\",c8c0e34420e46041a2356aaf827196f1,"no school fuck yeah!!!!\!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"i've no idea where i'm heading  i feel like i'm forever stuck in this rut  maybe, i'm just supposed to be forever alone never to find someone but it's my fault "
"thanks everyone who wished me a happy birthday, i'm sorry to those whom i did not reply to "
how come everytime i feel better   something has to go and bite my ass and bring me down again  im getting tired of this cycle 
you would think finding 20 quotes that you like would be easy   it isn't  annoyed 
i've lost all my faith and trust with people  it would be easier if people wouldn't beat around the bush and give you direct answers when you ask for them 
"i'm sick and tired of this, i call quits  say goodbye people, i'm going away for a while   annoyed  \text me if you want to talk, i'm going silent, no need to talk   "
"you know what, i hate my life, i really do  it's just getting worse and worse as i move along "
"bored, lonely   some moments \another day in the life of "
"another shitty, boring saturday     annoyed  \a beautiful day is wasted "

\start again, these days i pretend   \c8c0e34420e46041a2356aaf827196f1,i feel like i'm going to e playful lode in one way or another 
i hope it keeps raining   nothing better then to sleep to the sound of rain pouring 
\i couldn't spill my heart\,c8c0e34420e46041a2356aaf827196f1, annoyed  sometimes i really hate girls 
"i hate you and in that i hate myself, you've made me a mess, you told me one thing, yet you did it  it hurts so much, it does, i just want to die  problem is, you have no idea what chaos you are causing, so maybe this will get to you  i've got one question,    why? why didn't you just crush all my hopes  instead of fueling them, then crush them in this most inhumane and hurtful way?"
\how deep is this soul i feel i'm in?\,c8c0e34420e46041a2356aaf827196f1,i really hope the black keys get most if not all the grammys they were nominated for!
