life is very challenging right now   
bored on  the couch     
i'm soooo busy right now   not really    
i need some motivation   
hanging out with <propfirst> and <propfirst> at their work and <propfirst> is threatening to charge me for using the internet and fax machine   lol!!!!!
excited that the weekend is finally here   yay!!!
waiting for <propfirst> to wake up so i have someone to play with   lol!
"   at home sick, trying to cook and clean inbetween energy spurts   now i need a nap!"
so now i'm better after being sick for a couple days and now <propfirst> comes home sick    my poor baby!
had a blast this past weekend and so far i am keeping busy this week to keep from going crazy!!!
another good day     was nice to catch up with an old friend  hope to see more of her soon! love you <propfemale> smile 
"my baby loves me, he bought me a gps!!!"
going to visit my baby at work and have lunch! hopefully i will be bringing a friend with me!!!
time to wake <propfirst> up   he's been sleeping forever!!!
hanging around the house and enjoying doing nothing for now!
bored   bored   bored   
so glad the weekend is here   finally get some family and friends time!
does anyone have a cure for stress?
this baby can come out any day now   i am so ready!!!
people should be warned of what's to come during their last month's worth of doctors visits    can we say painful!!!
"went to the hospital today, thought i was in labor and turns out i am just sick and had a fever    i hate waiting sad "
"so now it's monday afternoon and the water still isnt fixed, going on 2 days now and i can add possible kidney stones to the list    this is not a good week so far!"
still hopeful that i go into labor this weekend! lol
   still pregnant    lol    
went to the dr  today   looks like i may be having this baby later than i thought!
my baby is finally here  <propfemale> <propmale> was born on 1 24 10 at 11 surprise 9 am  she weighed 4 lbs 12 oz  she was a c-section baby and is perfectly healthy  so glad to be home with my new family member!
having a relaxing weekend while trying to recooperate and bonding with my little one  yay!
newborn = no sleep    but she is definitley worth it!
thanks everyone for the birthday wishes yesterday smile 
trying to relax and enjoy the day   
making the most of every day from now on and learning not to take people or anything else for granted   
"everytime i see <propfemale> smile, it makes me feel all warm and squishy inside!"
i'm pretty sure i broke my freakin' toe today             so much for cleaning!
<propfemale> and me were bored so i uploaded goofy pictures of us!
went to take <propfemale> for a walk and its crazy <propfemale> outside!
   wishes i could go back to bed!
has the worst headache!
more marriages might survive if the partners realized that sometimes the better comes after the worse 
"everything has been said before, but since nobody listens we have to keep going back and beginning all over again "
"love is patient, love is kind  it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud  it is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs  love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth  it always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres  love never fails  1 corinthians 13:4"
love is blind -- marriage is the eye-opener   
"love - a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain, causes eyes to <propfemale>, cheeks to glow, blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker "
<propfemale> went to get her first set of shots yesterday and was fine     until we got home!
"rain, rain go away   because we have no power!"
   nevermind its fixed already!
so annoyed right now because i cant do an easy thing like open a stroller to take <propfemale> for a walk!!!!!!
been a busy and productive day so far    and yes i was able to take <propfemale> for a walk because i got lessons on how to unlock the stroller from my hubby!
it's disappointing to know that your parents aren't good grandparents   but its even worse when you knew it all along   
â€œwe must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment â€�
sooo  i lost my ring 2 days ago and you won't believe where i found it    in the cheese    don't ask! lol
"yeah, i'm bored    if you can't tell!"
hopefully today will be more interesting then yesterday    
semi-productive today   but missing my better half sad 
"  ok so now i lost my car keys    whats next, my mind???"
soooo     i'm not losing my mind because it took 5 days to figure out that <propfirst> accidentally took my keys instead of his when he took his truck to the shop to get fixed!
                                                                                                                                                                    
i have a new philosophy  i'm only going to dread one day at a time 
love: a temporary insanity curable by marriage 
at home sick     
feeling better already=-)
<propfemale> ate a small bite of banana today     yay!
just when you think your better    the sickness comes back and slaps you in the face!
"still sick, <propfirst> had to take me to urgent care yesterday and found out i have a sinus and ear infection   on antibiotics for 10 days    "
"had a great day yesterday cleaning and being productive, and hopefully by the end of this week i will be fully recovered!"
when a wife has a good husband it is easily seen in her face=-)
yay its friday!!! not like it matters since i'm home everyday anyways   lol
"went to the beach today with friends, had a great time and now 80% of my body is burned   lmao!!!"
