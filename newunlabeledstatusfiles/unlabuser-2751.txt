"i swear to god, this social network is absolutely horrible    glitches out the wazoo  if it weren't for the games that i enjoy so much, i'd delete my facebook profile altogether  i hardly ever use it anymore except to play the games and talk to the few people who actually have a conversation with me  and that list is so small, it's sad  and those of you who actually will respond back to me, you know who you are "
dooo doo <propfirst> doo    just sitting in my non-subterranean bat-cave aka my room 
"woo!! i got a 92 on my math test!!!  laugh  since the outcome of the math test will determine whether or not i'll be able to tutor at <propmale>  so getting an \a\"" on the math test will surely be enough to tutor math! another big ass smiley face """
"so i got the letter of recommendation from my math instructor, now all that is left is to fill out the rest of the paper work so i can tutor math at <propmale>! i'm so frickin excited, i just can't hide it  lol  laugh "
"who would have thought that being a math tutor at college would be this exciting? and doing something i love to do and getting paid to do it, it just blows my mind "
"i wear makeup so i'm fake  i like to dress up so i love myself  i say what i think so i'm a bitch  i cry sometimes so i'm an attention seeker  i talk to men so i'm a slut  i stand up for myself so i'm mouthy  i like food so im fat! seems like u can't do anything these days without being labeled, so label me cuz i don't give a shit!!!! post this as your status if you're proud of who you are!"
now the games on facebook are mocking me with their heart-shaped patterns  why do i always feel like i'm the one that is always on the outside of everything? like a child staring into a <propfemale> store wanting so much to satisfy that longing inside  it seems like i have to keep reminding myself that i'm a good person just to get through this lousy month with all the lovers walking around me everywhere i go 
"where's my fricking rum? oh, yea  i drank it all   annoyed  time to go get some more "
"you know how i am spending v-day? in college taking exams and when i get home, probably gonna sleep  yesterday was pretty fun, watched the third season of the big bang theory with my uncle and dj  but i did get some v-day <propfemale>, which made my day "
"i'm loving the warm weather today, but i'm still getting those light headaches   annoyed  i can't win, can i? either i'm freezing my ass off or it feels like my skull is imploding "
what do you call the people that you tutor? i think i'm just gonna refer to them as my clients   playful 
"-shakes head - what is my problem? i know this stuff so why was i tripping all over myself when i was tutoring? maybe since it's been so long since i've actually sat down and worked those kinds of problems  good thing i still remember how to work algebra problems, since my class has advanced algebra in it "
"good to see that the computers at the college operational once again, now i can amuse myself while waiting for my classes to begin "
epic weather fail! just as i was growing accustomed to the ground finally being free of snow     boom    more snow   annoyed 
"we all know that life is full of its ups and downs, and today is a prime example of one of the ups "
is anyone out there as bored as i am right now?
"just finished my midterm lab pratical, did some double-checking and i so ruled it!! who knew anatomy and physiology would be so easy "
omg! the battle of the bands so totally rocked!  laugh 
"since i have no idea if exams are going to stay spaced apart like this, i'm enjoying the time i have to relax and catch my breath(metaphorically )"
"i think the soda companies are lying to us! diet <propfemale> pepsi is supposed to be sugar free, then why do i feel like i could run a marathon? either way diet pepsi just tastes better than regular pepsi, and the reverse for coke products  am i the only one who thinks that?"
"sometimes i feel like the classes that i am taking are too easy  it doesn't take much effort to maintain an a in each class  i knew that math was gonna be a walk in the park for me, but psychology and anatomy are becoming as easy and natural as breathing "
"dude, i only have one tutoring appointment tonight  i need more clients, lol "
"my agenda for today: sit down with some dr pepper, chex mix and the <propfemale> trek that i never finished( courtesy of delaware tech)"
is probably gonna spend the rest of her weekend going over anatomy notes and listening to music 
facebook is duplicating my friends again  lol
"you know, maybe i have fell off the edge of the planet, metaphorically  i've been so out of touch with people i used to be very close to  hopefully, things will change and i will have more time for the people that are important in my life "
it's almost 3 smile 0 and i'm wide awake and ready for school  is there something wrong with this picture? since i don't have to leave for another 3 hours 
"just as i predicted, i fell asleep in class   annoyed  functions of e playful onents, and it wasn't hard really  just the power of my exhaustion was over-whelming "
"well, thanks to not having to take my math midterm, i have a free day on friday  woo! the question remains: what am i gonna do with the free time?"
" annoyed  i surprise myself sometimes  i know that soda and mint don't mix, and yet i still do it! lol"
meow!  laugh 
waahhh! i was hoping that my anatomy exam would have been graded by now 
ick  my feet are all squishy and squeaky when i walk  i can never sneak up on anyone this way 
"it never dawned on me how truly weird it is to be a state of delaware employee  most of the time, state employees just get by with the bare minimum work for the same amount of pay e playful ected from everyone who are working their butts off  that doesn't mean i'm gonna turn out like that, regardless of how much i get paid, i will perform my job with optimum quality"
"i have a feeling that this will be a great weekend  it usually is when the family comes up for a visit, and it's nice having better relationships with the family "
"i feel so blah  not sure why  the weekend was good, and tomorrow is gonna be an interesting day in lab  so why do i feel so    ick?"
"my hands smell like a couple of balloons, and no matter what i do, it won't go away!  annoyed "
"it is so nice outside, even got me out of me hoodie  lol"
"today's psychology class was another good, but no shocker there  we're in the chapter dealing with personality and what makes us who we are  our desires and our conscience  'course my group had to be the superego, which was a lot of fun "
"please put this on your status if you\know someone, are related to, and\adore someone who has asd, pdd,\adhd, add, odd, autism or aspergers  \these misunderstood, so called\   \trouble maker\"" kids just want to be\",383d3081deb0427af4a98934e5628bef,-loves logarithms - sooooooo easy 
i need to get out of the house and do something  -sighs -
"i found myself lost in my head today, not really thinking about anything in particular, just a random assortment of different ideas and whatnot "
"because my grades are     excellent, i have been invited to join the phi theta kappa honor society, the <propfemale> zeta kappa chapter!  joyful  just made my day! probably cause it feels great to be recognized for my hard work "
-snores - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
"it's my turn to fly\i'm proving ground tonight\try to be the best that i can\grown to be a man\only human can understand\i fill my lungs with fear and i exhale!\the urge - my turn to fly"
"i've said this before and i'll say it again, i love my psych class! after going over the psychological stages of development and realizing my father left( which is what i'm gonna call it because i lived with my mom for the majority of my life ) during my phallic stage of development "
"do you ever get the feeling that whenever you try to say something, you can never get it out quite right? and when you can finally get everything out, no one is there to listen , save for a certain few that you'd classify as true friends  sometimes i wonder who those people truly are "
bored!
i'm so ready to kick this math exam's ass! bwhahahahaha!!  laugh 
"someone please e playful lain to me why this is     i go to bed at 9 or 10, and feel like i haven't gotten any sleep  but when i go to bed at 12 smile 0 or 1, i feel energeized like i can take on the world "
"even though some of the videos we watched in psychology caused me to question the ethics of the e playful eriments, it made me realize how faulty we are as humans  sometimes i question our right to survive as a species, when we can be so cruel and vindictive  though, at the same time there are some people who would be more than willing to shoulder another person's pain "
hmm    bobble heads sitting in a pimped out car with hydraulics  sweet!
"whatever happened yesterday, i need to do it again! i actually woke up at noonish instead of 7, meaning much needed sleep!  laugh "
"dear winter, just let it go, your time is over! kthanks "

"you just woke up naked in my bed next to me     using only 3 words  what would you say to me? note: if you comment you must copy and paste this as your status, so i may comment on yours as well  be a good sport  play along "
brrrrr     so cold 
"as much as i love sitting in the college library and playing tetris, sitting in those chairs too long makes my ass hurt!  annoyed "
"i highly recommend that anyone listen to music in the shower, since it enhances the already invigorating soothing power of hot water   laugh "
can't sleep  what else is new?
"all of us have a thousand wishes  to be thinner, to be bigger, have more money,have a cool car, a day off, a new phone, to date the person of your dreams  a cancer patient only has one wish, to kick cancer's ass  i know that 97% of you won't post this as your status, but my friends will be the 3% that do  in honor of someone who died, or is fighting cancer, or even had cancer, post this for at least one hour "
