"â€œlife is full of beauty  notice it  notice the bumble <propfemale>, the small child, and the smiling faces  smell the rain, and feel the wind  live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams â€�"
"â€œonly\ a life lived for others is a life worth while â€�"
"â€œi've\ learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what \you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel â€�"
"â€œsometimes we\ must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that \is waiting for us â€�"
"â€œthe\ hardest thing in life is to know which bridge to cross and which to \burn"
"sometimes in life our actions and thoughts can alter the way others feel, react toward, or even care for us  more often than we think we need to think of the long term effects of our decisions, think before you act or you may regret what you have done, for there is no turning back!"
