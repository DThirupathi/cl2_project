i wish the world was flat like the old days and i could travel just by folding the map   so this is the new year 
"alright, alright "

going on a mission   
taking a step out of my comfort zone and trusting someone different just gets me fucked over   thought you were different   
i don't know what to have on my mind anymore   time will tell   
hmmm interesting night 
got super tan from the river yesterday   another mission accomplished 
starting now i'm starting over 
my judgement's getting kinda hazy
maybe i don't have to be good but i can try to be at least a little better than i've been so far 
you never fail to suprise me    keep me on my toes
"with a touch of redemption, a hint of elation; a recipe for disaster "
thought this was different   shoulda known better i guess   
don't fill up your head with trivial things   life's too beautiful for you to leave

"you've made a lasting impression, and if it doesn't feel right, then i just can't go wrong "

"i got a gnome in the backyard, i put him right on the x <propfirst>   heâ€™s supposed to show me where the money is "
i just wanna stay up and watch the rain with someone special
