"seven times seven, and angels speak, of darkness to come, and love to seek  o o wierd crap comes into my head sometimes   "
*yawns* boredness   
"darkness leads my heart astray, nobody cares for me, so hear me now as i say, i won't see another day  i was left here all alone, sorrow bound my heart to stone, nobody came so here it shown, in the ground my drying blood is sewn "
*jumps off a <propmale>*

"wow, did i mess up that bad?"
"been thinking about rain for the last few days, dunno why, but i wish it would do so soon "
so tired of never knowing what i'm doing with my life   
"they say freak,  when you're singled out,  the red, well it filters through   so lay down, the threat is real,  when his sight goes red again "
"dunno what's going on, i do know that i want to sleep, but i don't know what's going on still "
"gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around and i'll keep this world from draggin' me down gonna stand my ground and i won't back down"

i cannot feel my arms  seriously  i just spent three hours digging a 4x3 6 foot hole in the ground  - -
"shadows wander 'cross my mind, often answers are so hard to find  but i must not give in, i must move on, i cannot falter, must move towards the sun  so please don't surrender, i'll be there soon, i'll be there with you by the light of the <propfemale> "
"eternity weighs down on me,  life lost in bittersweet sorrow,  and evermore dominion weeps,  the miseries of tomorrow  but happiness it must exist, for why else are we here? no god's so cruel as that, to let us live in naught but fear "
"it's the blood that ties, it's the hurt that heals  it's the face you hide, hide's the pain you feel  so hold me up now, yeah, i'm afraid to breathe, and i'm lost to you  ~ believe in angels"
