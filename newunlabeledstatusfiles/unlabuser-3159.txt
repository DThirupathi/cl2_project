"in super <propfirst> brothers 3, <propfemale> toadstool has once again been kidnapped by <propmale> koopa  so if she's a prisoner, how come she has the freedom to mail items to <propfirst> to help him find her? and if she's going to send mail, why not a direct map to her location or a magic flute that will bring him to her so he can avoid all the obstacles?"
out   happy new year!!!
"so long, 2010  you won't be missed "

does anyone want a kitten? a stray cat made itself at home in our garage and gave birth to five 
i've learned three things recently: 1: sometimes the people you trust the most are the most likely to let you down  2: my hatred of <propfemale> streep has only grown stronger with time  3: it's harder to find homes for stray kittens than i thought 
the woman at the table next to me while i was waiting to pick up dinner was talking to her friend about how she needed to go pick up some monistat  ew 
"5 17 1912 - 9 19 2003  seven years  i miss you, granny   sad "

"a travesty has occurred today -- well sometime since last christmas: in preparation for the holidays i was looking through my christmas movies, and my copy of home alone is missing! anyone with information is asked to come forward    "
thinking about stuff      annoyed 
it's funny when people fall over 
i've come to a conclusion: i wish i could go back in time 10 years and cut some people out of my life and make sure i stayed closer to others 
   
i give up 
it's officially time to begin my nonstop holiday enthusiasm  happy thanksgiving!
about time for the annual thanksgiving viewing of home alone
