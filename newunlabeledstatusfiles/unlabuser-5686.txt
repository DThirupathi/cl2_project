you did it to yourself now you're all by yourself acting like you hate me  left because you made me you played me to the left now there's nobody left to hear your complaining i'm gone and all you're hearing is your own <propfemale> 
"you think youâ€™ve heard this before well, iâ€™ll try and say it differently as long as it comes naturally to me itâ€™s been makinâ€™ me sad cuz i canâ€™t find a better way to speak the words i wanna say to you oh, how i love you oh, how i need you that i want you to know wonâ€™t let you down no, i canâ€™t let go and i want you to see everyday i wear my heart on my sleeve "
