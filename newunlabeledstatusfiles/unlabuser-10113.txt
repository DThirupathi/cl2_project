bestest night ever bitches!!!! love you all!!!
it's a war in your bedroom baby  cut off my tongue for just a taste    of a piece of your flesh my darling  we got no time to hestitate 
"call it in the air, \heads or tails, \heads we go to london, \and try to save the <propfemale>, \tails we go to <propfirst>, \and try our hand at romance"
"i went to heaven, but couldn't get in, for what i have done  i said please take me, they said you're crazy you had too much fun     you can't save me, you can't blame me, well i'm waiting here to take a fall, and everything, everything's my fault "
"now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug and throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs  i'm double fisted and if you're empty you can grab a cup  boy stop, i'm just playing  let me dap you up  baby baby you're in my system  baby baby tell me your listening "
"you wanna play it safe, don't wanna step out  you gotta pretend so no one finds out  you gotta break free, you gotta break out, so everybody knows what you're all about \don't be afraid to be the one to start it up, it's a party, once you turn it on it's hard to turn it off  listen to the music, turn it up, let it go  take it in until you feel it take control "
"iâ€™m gonna live my life from day to night with no hesitation\make the best of every situation that i find myself placed in\decidin right from wrong, choosing my final destination\cause when itâ€™s said and done, itâ€™s just yourself that you are facinâ€™"
"i had some nightmares clawing at my skin and bones  i nearly did e playful lode  you smoke the demons, gave me back my feelings  now i'm good to go     i said from the start you can take it or leave it  prefer that you keep it, don't let go "
"when i picked you up for our first date baby\well, your pretty blue eyes, they were drivin' me crazy\and the <propfemale> little thought that was so amazing\is they were lookin at me "
"kill the lights,\these children learn from cigarette burns, fast cars, fast women, and cheap drinks,\it feels right,\all these asphyxiated, self-medicated; take the white pill, you'll feel alright"
"when i was younger, so much younger than today, i never needed anybody's help in any way  but now these days are gone, i'm not so self assured, now i find i've changed my mind and opened up the doors "
"so i just    \sit right here and have another beer in mexico\do my best to waste another day\sit right here and have another beer in mexico\let the warm air melt these blues away"
"'cause i've got friends in low places \where the whiskey drowns \and the beer chases my blues away \and i'll be okay \i'm not big on social graces \think i'll slip on down to the oasis \oh i've got friends in low places"
"you like misery, now you wishin me back and listening\echoes whispering haunt your nightmares\you used to call me, and i'd be right there\the feelings did change, but that was your choice\but now you're left with the sound of your own voice,\can you hear me?"

"now i'm lying on the table with everything you said, it will all catch up eventually  well, it caught up and honestly the weight of my decisions were impossible to hold, but they were never yours  they were never yours "
"look like nothing's gonna change  everything still remains the same  i can't do what ten people tell me to do  so i guess i'll remain the same, yes  sittin' here restin' my bones and this loneliness won't leave me alone  it's 2thousand <propmale> i roamed just to make this dock my home!!!"
"i'm sorry that i hurt you \it's something i must live with everyday \and all the pain i put you through\i wish that i could take it all away, and be the one who catches all your tears \that's why i need you to hear       i've found a reason for me to change who i used to be "
