"you might feel a little gloomy today, libra, and perhaps have no idea why  it might be a good idea to retrace your steps for the past day or so  look within to find out if anything you may have seen could have awakened unconscious memories from the past  what a relief if this is the case  release the traumas from the past and you'll feel like a heavy weight has come off your shoulders "
