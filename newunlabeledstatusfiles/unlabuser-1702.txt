*sighs* stardock failed to start the external <propfemale> of elemental this past week   i hope i get picked for the <propfemale> when they do start it    oh yeah - sitting still while getting your hair cut can be quite painful when you have a herniated disc 
"bypassing twitter character limit (grrr)   attempted to cut down the jungle in the back yard   hoping that doesn't result in a week of back pain   i've been reading a few books from the saga of recluce   hopefully within 2 weeks the elemental beta will start   will most likely play heroes of newerth on friday again and, most likely, lose a few games "
"elemental beta - not fun - interesting to mess with, but not fun   of course, they don't want it to be fun - yet    majesty 2 - i hope i don't go through all of the missions this weekend "
"been doing a lot of reading lately - re-reading the wheel of time series, while waiting for the next part of the last book to be released   wonder why i haven't finished majesty 2 yet   "
"i need to know what system (ps3, xbox, or pc) people are planning to get dragon age for   i've read the pc version may have a feature or two the others don't (top view) - but i might get a copy for the ps3 instead (maybe as well) if enough other people are getting it for that system "
"i've been thinking of attempting to run a mini-dnd game   which i blame on <propfemale> arcade's dnd podcasts starring will weaton   i think gencon was a bad thing   i keep of thinking of the prototype games i've played there, that don't exist in the market "
"hmmm, 5 hours to kill before game night starts - all caught up on books, and none of the dvds are calling to me   maybe i'll try playing one of those nifty pc games - like trying to kill the dragon on majesty 2 "
"pc overheating again - removed a bit of dust from the rear fan, and re-applied thermal paste to cpu heatsink - we'll see if it buys me another 3 months or not "
wonder if sleep will avoid me for a 3rd night in a row - lets find out 
"i am tired   which is a good thing at this time   but being tired most of the day was annoying   i've been researching with my free time lately (when i'm not watching dvd's)   thinking of building a new pc (current one is a whole 2 years old) and trying to learn some graphic api's (ogre) to do some game programming   i typed up a boring event that happened earlier today, but went over the fb 420 char limit (grrr) "
*sighs* think i might have to research insomnia soon 
wishes he could make a wildcard filter for facebook (block wants to win a  wink    i had other random thoughts but they ran away from me 
first heavy snowfall in md - i'll probably have to shovel today before the ground freezes 
i think the twice weekly walking + cold weather has helped my back some   been spending my free time watching dvd's (mostly anime) and reading   maybe i'll play a pc or ps3 game sometime this weekend   oh yeah:  new tires = better control of vehicle   what game have you played recently?
"work has been draining this week - spent most of it thinking about 1 problem - still haven't solved it (arrgg)   i've been trying to engage my third brain cell, but they just aren't working well enough yet   i wonder if work is going to slow down for me the next 2 weeks as everyone else enjoys time away from the office "
"the snow   it wouldn't go away    it   covered things    it chilled things    it drenched my clothes, it frosted my hair - i had no idea, it was everywhere !"
"tired    so tired   not sure why, i slept enough last night, but the tired just wouldn't go away   i wonder if i'll play any pc games this weekend  i don't suppose anyone would be willing to renew my drivers license for me early next week ?  i can give you a recent photo of me, and my eye exam results   they shouldn't need me there personally "
"so tired   12 5 hours of driving is a lot for one day (that is only travel time, not including breaks + lunch + fuel)   had a nice 1 5 weeks in k-town, unfortunately got sick for my b-day - least i was mostly better for the drive back   may post more details later "
"i wonder how much time over this long weekend i'll spend in my cave (basement w  pc)   i have a new pc game, and a few old ones to brush the dust off of   but then, i have some new games for the consoles to play upstairs, and <propfemale> and i have a few dvd's to watch   choices   all of which will distract me from adding order to the house "
"stupid cold is draining me of the energy i need to fully enjoy the end of my vacation (or be productive in the fight against chaos)   when i was in k-town, i tried to pick up the game key harvest (sp?) -  but the rockheads owner claimed the game was already out of print   didn't realize the game was that old, and that board games go out of print so fast "
"bah   yes bah   what else would i say?  i still have my cold, although it is so minor, it is just an annoying reminder that i was, indeed, sick   my back acks, but not that much - no need for pain killers this day   so \bah\"" is all i have to say for today """
<propmale> dunham was fun   was able to sit through the whole show confortably   i probably could have done without the guitar guy - which wouldn't have been as bad if i had my earplugs with me   now i get to stay up for another hour while waiting for laundry to finish   back to re-reading the saga of recluce 
"seems like my back is still doing better this month   able to sit (although slightly reclined) through a 2 hour meeting today, no pain killers   still need to be more productive at home   hopefully i can motivate myself to do some game programming this weekend "
work has picked up a little this week   my back has been doing fine   i've been getting to the gym about 2 times a week(need 3+)   starcraft 2 beta started and supreme commander 2 demo is out - leaves little time left to clean house 
i think i'm damaged - i'd rather research own new games then play the ones i currently own   elemental beta does not currently play on my pc and starcraft 2 and supreme commander 2 are both calling me   
"rpg gamers - fyi, white knight chronicles is out, final fantasy xiii should be out next tuesday, and resonance of  fate the tuesday after that (2 weeks)  rts gamers - supreme commander 2 is out today  sorry if this is a double post, but i can't find my previous post from last night - i think the share button failed "
"getting over a cold   setting up a pc - don't have aim setup yet   pc doesn't seem to overheat from playing games - i'm happy     and tired    well, mostly tired "
"ahh, a day of gaming   i wonder if i enjoyed the day a little more than usual having won all but 1 game (out of 4 board games + 2 fooseball games)   sceptor of zavandor was interesting - the only reason i won was because another player really messed up the person in the lead "
3 hours of sleep plus a 12 mile bike ride = one exausted mr hucker   i'm still glad i did the bike ride though - hopefully there will be many more 
finally hooked up <propfemale> (yahoo messenger) on my new pc - i can chat again using a real chat tool !!
"calling all pc gamers (i might be the only one i know) - any of you try the new settlers 7 game ?  i have it, and i've played it a few times   i really can't see playing this against other people though - not sure why   just seems slow i guess compaired to other rts games   but i like the resource management style of game for a single player game "
i think i picked up a bug - most likely from the concert   i just hope it dies quick 
"hrm    games    civ v     great, another one i'll have to purchase when it is released   for now i'm trying to listen for the call of sleep "
another patch for elemental (still in beta) - game seems to run now (not sure if it was the patch or new pc)   i'll have to invest some time in it this weekend and see if i like where the game is going    but at least it has a magic system in the game now 
i messed up - evidently carrying a box of  paper is too much for my back - been in pain every day since monday   i  hope i get back to 'normal' sometime soon 
"well, i just scrubbed my old disc drives - hopefully i don't need any information from them "
"hopefully today will be half productive   although i'm not sure what i\m going to do for the half fun   hope most of you can get some relaxation in this weekend """
i got invited to the starcraft 2 beta     wonder if i'll get around to using it (haven't been using pc much lately) 
"picked up dominion and key harvest - wonder if i'll learn a strategy to either one   caylus is a tough game, still haven't figured out a winning strategy for that one "
needs a shot of motivation   just finished a project for work thats been keeping me busy for last week and this week   not sure what i want to do for fun this weekend 
"i usually do not enjoy concerts   i did, however, enjoy the weird <propmale> concert we saw tonight   he was entertaining, and played a lot of songs that i liked   some of the enjoyment might have been from the pain killers though   i just hope my back doesn't complain all day tomorrow for sitting for 2 hours today "
omnibus ! http annoyed  www youtube com watch?v=kspjkl69wpg&feature=related
"i must have annoyed the water plumber gods   had a friend fix a water leak in a bathroom, and now i have water under the water heater "
let's see - fix toilet - check   fix evidence of water under water heater - ongoing   fix new sound the car makes - ongoing   this may be a very e playful ensive month for me   on the bright side - my back has been doing better lately 
"stuff !! - the things we need   stuff, it's where your money goes "
i bet timm sinnen would like this : http annoyed  feastinginphoenix com ?p=49
i was tempted to get a tank-less water heater - until i heard an approximate install price of $3-$4k  *sighs* - i'm sure there was a reason i bought this place to begin with 
"back to playing elemental beta again    hit a crash or 2, awaiting the next patch with, hopefully, crash fixes   didn't get a lot done this weekend   everyone ready for monday ?  i know i could do with another day or two before monday starts   "
"i forgot how much i liked my pc desk   i also didn't realize how much dust collected on it, under the boxes books   it's odd sitting down, playing on the pc, but i hope i get the <propmale> to get used to it again   it seems i can now sit for about 4 hours at a time with a small break   not sure what made my back happy, but i'm going to take advantage of it "
"another off friday - not sure what i'm going to do today   tried a game of elemental - but my <propmale> was killed early - reloaded and it crashed    that's beta for you   one month, elemental, 2 months, civ 5   somewhere within the next 3, patrician 4   lots of 'e playful loring' type games this fall "
i am really glad i got out of magic the gathering   out of curiosity i checked on ebay - and it seems people are still paying $15 or more for specific (rare) cards   the whole 'rare' thing annoys me with collectible card games   they don't have to be rare - the company can print more of them !!!
"concert last night - barenaked ladies   was okay - they had some interesting stuff that i haven't heard before - a few songs that were a little slow for me, but okay   unfortunately i was awake till 3 smile 0 am and didn't know about the 7 am construction (neighbor roof)   took the day off, so i could     be tired ? (avoid driving while tired)"
"poker night     hope i win    but then, doesn't everyone ?"
"just a reminder - back up your data!! if you haven't done so in the past year or so, do it now   i now know 2 people who's computers (one desktop, one laptop) died recently   if you don't have a backup device - you should be able to find one at best buy or  walmart k-mart for about $60 for a 340gb external drive - (not sure which would work for macs though, read the boxes)    how much is your data worth to you ?"
back from atlantic city - lost $3 at the poker tables (2 4 lhe) - guess i can chop that up as a $3 learning e playful erience   had fun - horrible weather (it was warm and <propfemale> all 3 days!!) - spent most of the time at the showboat   time to rest now 
"minecraft (pc game), league of legends (free pc game), and a new 'lifestyle' (diet)   fun fun   the last is more time consuming then anything else - trying to get a balance for all the meals of the day takes effort   now that you have an update on my boring life, you can go stalk someone else  smile "
"favorite snack food - nachos and cheese   current 'lifestyle plan' - limit fat, especially from cheese   the two just don't mix    however, my plan does allow me to eat low fat cream cheese (in very limited quantities)   solution - cream cheese + death sauce + low fat low sodium crackers   success !!"
blah - civ 5 is using steamworks   i may no longer want that game  *sighs*
"well, the stress of planning for the trip for the ibm conference is over   now i just have to survive the air trips   6 hours (3 and 3) on a crowded plane sounds like hell to me "
"i wonder if i'll make progress on my list of things need be done this weekend   anyone else plan to sleep in sunday this weekend ?  (and no, that's not my list of things need be done, but it should be)"
league of legends   fun free game    requires teamwork   and mumble is a decent chat program 
home    tired     was a short visit - didn't get to visit with people as much as i would have liked too - but didn't have much choice either   hopefully in 2 years we will have enough vacation for a 2 week visit 
i've decided to update my photo today 
getting windows installed   i think the sales guy pulled a fast one me - told me they would work on one (or few?) windows at a time and not take out the rest until they finished the ones they started   oh well - just have to wear a jacket in my house for today   also - i might have messed up my back with all of the late minute cleaning moving of furniture   hopefully it is a small thing and i recover by tomorrow 
yeah - windows are installed    i'z tired   still have to put the blinds back up 
went to the casino friday night   i won   wonder if i'll win the next time i go   i'z still tired 
i don't think i'm meant to wake up before 10 am anymore   i heard there may be some snow in the midwest - hope everyone is doing okay 
"i went to the casino fri night   i lost 2 3 of what i won   i plan to take a break from there for a while   still haven't reset my sleep schedule since friday - at least, i still wake up tired even after 8 hours of sleep   been playing rift beta - i have a key if anyone else wants an invite to the next beta event   don't think i'll buy rift "
"i found out this morning that i wasn't awake enough to go down stairs, ended up on the first floor just a few moments sooner than planned   isn't stuff that like supposed to happen on mondays and not fridays ?"
"bah - i think my house doesn't like me   maybe it doesn't like my neighbor, i'm not sure   today it dropped 2 pieces of siding on my neighbors house, and the 6 or so strips above are are swaying in the wind, just waiting for its <propmale> to pounce on someone   i hope i can get someone out tomorrow to fix it, not sure what it is going to cost me   oh great, a wind advisory until 1 am "
"oh game update - if you play rift, i was just notified today that the next (possibly last?) beta starts tomorrow (the 15'th) and lasts until monday   if anyone is interested in rift and needs a vip beta invite, let me know   rift is a mmorpg similar to wow, everquest, or the like   i still have no plans to buy the game once it is out, but that is mostly because it has monthly fees "
wonder how much is it going to cost to get the 5 siding panels put back up there   hopefully no more fall off 
"bought rift    although don't have all that much time to play it   btw - anyone want to help me put up blinds for the kitchen ?  i put one up in the living room, think it took me about 2 5 hours "
bah - thought i was done with that silly cold bug     ended up dizzy after 30 minutes of light activity   *sighs*  what to do with the next 7 hours of the day   maybe play rift or league of legends   
"sometimes - i hate computers   helped a neighbor improve the performance of his pc, and have another pc to repair that i built almost 3 years ago   i think the cure for the first problem is to force everyone i know to change to linux    of course, i'd be the last to step up because i need to play my pc games   "
