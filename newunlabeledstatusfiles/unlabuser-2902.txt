"put <propfemale> to bed in <propfirst>'s bed last night (he was sleeping with <propfemale>)  i slept in an extra half hour this morning and when i did wake up i didn't hear <propfemale> crying    immediately went into <propfirst>s room to check on her and she was laying in the bed wide awake    and <propfirst> was sitting next to her on the bed   he said \good morning mommy i was just reading to <propfemale> and cuddling with her until you woke up\"""""
