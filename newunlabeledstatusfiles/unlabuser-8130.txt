of course you would do that  that's awesome! now what would be even cooler is if it still worked 
homework! it seems like homework is always on my mind  apparently i don't have a life 
is analyzing a sonnet for class 
"man, yesterday was fun!"
"felt earthquake tremors! that was a different e playful erience (6 9 magnitude in baja, calafornia) "
castles and coasters!
guitar hero rocks!
"i'm finally home  it's been a long weekend, but it's been fun  congratulations to the wedded couple; i wish them a very happy future together  it's nice to be home "

finishing homework early feels weird
