"urbandictionary com   <propmale>-the coolest guy in the world, but can be an asshole from time to time and is carefree when it comes to just about anything  basically he just doesn't give a shit   a <propmale> or nick   enjoys chonga and the finer things in life   he is a drifter and a daydream believer   some might speculate that the <propmale> is a conceited, hopeless romantic, and is most likely a loner "
"so, <propfirst> <propmale> is getting his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for a 9th time, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods are screwing everything, yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage?? really??   \ feel free to copy and paste if you agree!"""
