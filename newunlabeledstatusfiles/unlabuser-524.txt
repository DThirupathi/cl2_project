there are times i wonder why i keep on going   but then i remember how strong i am   the will i have   i'm better than failure 
i'm never working an overnight shift again   and when i say never i mean neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-eeeeeeever ever     a-gain!
finally beat psychonauts today   totally worth the time and effort to track it down 
"gah, why does this stupid thing keep logging me out?  i shall not be kept away!"
days off are really boring   never thought i'd actually be looking forward to going to work 
"you know it's said that giving up is always the easiest way to deal with something   that the harder, and more rewarding thing to do is persist and stick with something no matter what   well sometimes maybe easy wins out despite it being the bad thing   maybe easy will just have to win this final round "
oh my dear lord i love <propmale> and cheese!
oh my god     metal gear! blarahharagahaghagagarah!
i'm too fat    i must change this 
the 28th cannot get here fast enough   time to let out all those bottled up feelings in one night 
over night shift with night crew + sudden change in my work schedule to work a four hour shift the same day = zombie
"right now is one of those times where i just want to give up   i try to put on a strong face for everyone around me, but inside i'm breaking apart so badly   i still don't know what went wrong, what i did or didn't do   i miss it though   not what it was at the end of everything, but what it used to be   when i knew they actually still cared   i'm not going to find that again "
"i know you'll probably never see this, and i don't care if you do   you ruined me   you took the last little bit of real hope i had and destroyed it   i hope you're pleased with yourself   you've done worse to me than anyone ever has, and over what?  nothing that's what   i hope you're fucking happy   i didn't deserve this "
the breath of life  the breath we must all take in the beginning  when first taken cannot be taken away  to exist  to be  cannot be denied  waste something as precious as time  the stars will all fall  i wouldn't mind  through all the lies  i see you   i will survive 
"blarg, i am headcrab zombie   that is all "
"blarg, overnight shift+walking home in the cold = ow "
"infest was fucking amazing   loved 2 cents, but of course five finger death punch took the show   only bad news is that my camera died   oh and i almost got my leg broken, kicked in the face, and had someone land on my chest that was almost as big as i was   so all and all (except the camera thing) a damn good show "
"bwahahaha! sickness cannot keep the headcrab zombie down!  only guns, and fire, and sawblades can     i just scared myself "
sometimes i really have to wonder   are the things i believe to be true just that?  or are they just illusions i've put up to comfort myself?
"one day, i'm going to buy a cat   a maine coon to be exact   and i'm going to name them shanks, because of my rogue on morrowind   then i'll slap the taste out of anyone's mouth that asks if i named them based on <propmale> potter "
"no one listens    because i'm somewhere in between my love and my agony you see, i'm somewhere in between my life is falling to pieces somebody put me together ~ faith no more"
cab that dropped me off got stuck in the snow   i moved it to the side single handedly to help him get unstuck  i am a god! >>  ego moment  lol
so i guess me being possessed sounds like a mumbly british person   who knew?
"i actually managed to get my hands on a copy of <propfemale> megami tensei: devil summoner 2!  freaking <propfirst> frost plushie, yay!"
"that's it, i'm old now   break out the metamucil and prune juice   i'll get the wheelchair and the stick i'll use to poke all the young'ns with "
grabbin' pills   laugh 
caedite eos  novit enim dominus qui sunt eius 
"remember what i said about women in scrubs?  well i came to realize today, women in fatigues = omgwtf hot!"
"due to a bit of stupidity at work, i will soon be getting a $400 gift card from the corperation that i can trade in for other gift cards in the store   this means i will get to keep about $300 of it plus almost my entire next check   gamestop here i come   soon to have 360 and i too will be grabbin' peelz!"
"thursday must come   must get paycheck, must not snow   i have the gift cards, the 360 is so close i can almost taste it "
i am now the proud owner of a christmas story on dvd  my life is now complete 
"i know    it's just a game   but damn it, i'm starting to get paranoid when i go outside "
i think i'm going to start carrying a guitar with me at all times   maybe a firearm if i can afford it   possibly a bottle of pain killers as well    
i think i don't update this thing enough   either that or i don't have enough of a life to constantly update about it   great    now i'm depressed 
might i just reiterate from my last post    fuck snow! fuck it all to hell!
okay   i believe i'm sick of living again   can i get off the ride anytime soon?
i have new purpose   i am unbroken   this is my absolution 
"it's funny   i almost feel depressed   but at the same time i'm laughing and joking and generally enjoying life   it just feels like there's a hole   a gap   a dark cloud that constantly looms over my <propfemale> days   i don't know how to get rid of it   and everyone around me seems so happy   and it's not like i'm not, it's just not always genuine "
"feh, i'm sick of being single "
"recently, i've grown very fond of the word \bumblefuck\"" """
"oh how i wish i was set free, of burdens in life, plentifully  but <propfemale> this weight i must, and pray my back it does not bust "
bah! being lonely sucks   someone come and comfort keep my company   please?
"there are times i worry that i don't have a heart left to break   that's when it seems to hurt the most, as if only just to remind me that it's still there "
"part of me, wants to give up   wants to believe that there can be no good in humanity   become a bitter, broken husk of a human being and resent everything and everyone to my grave   but i can't, my heart won't allow it   i don't know why either   it seems incapable of actually giving up hope   i don't know if it's a gift or a curse   but whatever it is, it makes me who i am   who am i to deny it?"
buh   that is all 
pancakes 
"i just love being called an \incompetent asshole\"" by some random jackhole on xbox live   i didn't see them doing much better and yet they were the one doing the most bitching """
"on this night, i close my eyes   i drift away to a place where i cannot be hurt   safe from everything   sheltered   until that damned intruding bastard the sun pulls me away   to dream   to dream a dream that never ends   where all is in my grasp, all is in my control   the world bends to my whims   free   free of it all   now i just close my eyes   and dream "
my service manager told me that 'an early shift is wasted on me' today because i wasn't running straight home to watch the super bowl   this is one of many things that she's done lately to make herself slightly less attractive to me   i think she knows that i like her a bit too much and might be doing it on purpose   or i'm just paranoid   yeah    paranoid  <<
basically   fuck this month   that is all 
"addendum to previous post: also, very much fuck this entire day "
"also, that last my was supposed to be a me   so there "
can it be march already?  please?
"very very much, i do not like the snow   it can go away and not come back   so there "
"let me tell you, there's no greater feeling in l4d2 than joining a quick match versus game and finding a team that you instantly click with   sure you're all a bit iffy as the survivors, but when it comes time to play as the infected you can read and respond to each others moves perfectly   domination, it's a team effort "
"heh, i'm starting to pounce like a pro with the <propmale>   also my rep is up to four and a half stars   the people on l4d2 on xbl are starting to take note of me   yay! lol"
"oh goodie, my hdmi cable has crapped out on me   now i have to wait til thursday to get and xbl gaming or tv watching done   fuck "
"so i've pushed my body to a breaking point   i've torn pulled at least three muscles in the last week   last night i felt like i couldn't even stand up anymore   but i did   in the words of <propfirst> from the original left 4 dead, \it's a good thing i'm indestructible\"" """
puh   shit sucks   just    i hate everything 
also facebook needs to update my xbox live gamecard!  i'm up to 3400 and it's stuck on 3110 
"i don't know what i ate, but i believe i could power a small country   let's just leave it at that "
"why does no one ever play hard rain on versus mode?  for christ sake people, the witches aren't that scary, are they?"
"stupid dream + random bout of depression + moron customers + rainy day = not so happy <propmale>   but don't worry, i can fake happy   i've done it before, i can do it now   just plaster that stupid complacent smile on my face, say nice words to people who might get worried and everything will be okay   at least that's how it usually goes "
"not to mention i believe i freaked out some co-workers by headbutting punching more things that i usually do in front of them   but it's not like i did any actual damage (to the property), so why should they give a flying fuck?"
"buh, i can't decide if i'm feeling good or depressed   it's weird because i'm happy and all that but i can feel a dark cloud looming   where's a weather machine when i need one!?"
"and what ever may come, it slowly disappears   to somewhere in the back of my mind   it will remain there, until i wish to retrieve it   this mode is incredible, it's out of this world   too bad that i must always leave it   but that's life "
you can't see me for i hide within the umbra 
jumpin' jehosaphat! clowns!?
"so, just got odst the other day   gotta say i love the feeling of actually feeling moral in a halo game   most the time when playing as <propfirst> you tend to feel a bit too invincible when rushing in head long against the covenant   this one you really feel like you need to use cover and a touch of stealth   oh plus i loved seeing the story unfold from so many different angles "
"ah, new bank account, now it's off to work to go play management for the day "
"not entirely sure why, but i've been absolutly obsessed with lamb of god and metallica lately   there's just something about some good old fashioned metal that puts a calm in my soul "
"sometimes, when i'm feeling really bad about the way i look or how my body is   i take a trip to my local walmart, and suddenly walk out feeling much better about myself   love "
there's just something about waking up and finding a text from someone very special to you telling you that they 'love you so flipping much'   it tells you that today is going to be a really good day   love 
"gah, i have to resort to walmart of all places to get my ps3   i'm sorry gamestop   but at least i'll be buying god of war 3 from you today "
"nothing is true, everything is permitted "
off to the bank to make a deposit   probably going to stop by 7-11 on the way back   yay for lunch from a 7-11!
last second change of plans on the way back   slurpee from 7-11 and an italian bmt from subway   can you say perfect lunch?
"also, holy freaking crap   got an e-mail today saying that my local rock metal station kbpi is counting the mayhem festival this year as their birthday bash concert   goodbye $50+ tickets, hello tickets for $10 67   just freaking awesome "
"okay, track and comfirm says that my warbeast is at least in my neighborhood post office   so if it doesn't show up today, heads will roll    or at least i'll be angry about it "
"okay, warbeast just showed up   it's an amazing little piece of equipment   it'll just take a little getting used to   my arm is a bit tired already "
buh  my left arm    wants to fall off   someone make it better!
"well   i've had the best week and a half so far  but for some reason i've also been more depressed lately than i have been in a while   don't understand it, don't think i want to   i just want everything to stop for a bit "
"shoot light, get detected   kill guard, get detected   don't kill guard, get detected   use gadget, get detected   sneak around, get detected   bump into traffic cone, get detected   what do you want from me <propmale> clancy!?"
"our service desk got robbed last night not twenty minutes after my shift ended   i was told someone came in, demanded money, then ran out   security did nothing from what i heard, but then again we had one of the non-regulars there   i can't help but feel things would have been different if i had been there   no instead they go after my female co-worker tunisha   this is going to eat at me for days "
"guh, okay    i'd like to stop existing for about a week or so   just for a week   though hopefully i can still get paid for that week   some sort of loophole clause about a metaphysical anomaly forcing me out of existence constitutes a paid leave of absence  lol"
my god did today suck   tomorrow better be better or else    uhhmmmm   or else    it just better be better! lol
"yeah, right now i'm pretty much done   i'm sick of worrying my head off about everything   i'm sick of being so damned conflicted, i'm just sick of all of this   hell i'm half tempted to just delete this and only emerge from my damned house when it's time to work "
another night gone by   i don't even care anymore 
"maybe i'm just not meant to have a simple, happy life   maybe every time i start to get everything going my way something is supposed to screw it all up   maybe i'm just lifes little whipping boy to be pushed and shoved til i break   but hey, if that's my role in life, who am i to go against it? smile and take it til i break   that's what i'll do "
"i'd say what i want to right now, but i'm afraid i'd alienate myself   i'll just say this, i'm not too happy "
"just got done watching ponyo before i head into work   best redbox rental, ever   i'm going to have to go out and buy it here sometime "
"in all honesty, i'm starting to think i should just delete this thing   i hardly ever update it, it's almost useless to me "
"guh, how about i just start sleeping all the time when i'm not at work?  then maybe i won't have time to get all bored and depressed and what not   then again that wouldn't leave time for gaming   crap   time for a new plan "
"shit kind of sucks   glasses broke, probably gonna be out on my own in the next few months, car starting to act broken   on the plus side, work isn't too far to walk, i'm head clerking all next week, and if i keep getting good hours, contact lenses will be next   not sure how to feel about all this, but it could really be worse "
i just found out that <propfemale> pie ice cream is just about the greatest damn thing to ever grace this entire existence   my taste buds have transcended into an age of flavor enlightenment 
woo! i gots me a pay raise! i'm up to a whole $11 03 an hour   yay monies! lol
"just got done eating a drumstick   haven't had one in a while and used my tongue to scoop out the last little bit of ice cream before biting into it   i feel rather skilled, yet oddly some how very dirty "
<propfemale> fistmas 
"okay, so this is awesome   i ordered some powerthirst from canada about a week ago or so   now come to find out, it's been stopped in washington by customs to be checked over   so now i'm probably going to owe ups even more than i already paid for it when it does show up  is wanting to be uncomfortably energetic really that much of a crime?"
"okay so i've decided that i'm going to find some way to destroy the sun   then i can go down in history as the person that single handedly brought about the extinction of the human race   but first, i finish my cocoa puffs "
"okay, time to see if i can resist my urge to spend every cent that i get from work and actually save up   i have til september   knowning me i'll be lucky to have maybe $200 by then, if that "
"fuh, management today   going to be dead by the end of the day   goooooooo having a retail job! kill me  lol"
"just got done watching diary of a wimpy kid, definetly worth the $4 99 rental price from comcast "
"though i may not always act like it, and may not always be the most positive person   i want to say and let it be known, i love my friends   every last one of them   be them the people i've known almost my whole life, or the people i've just gotten to know through work   you will all always have a special place in what's left of my heart   love "
"so right now i'm phoneless, over worked, sore all over, generally disliking work   in fact, sometime it almost pushes me to the point of wanting to do terrible things to the customers, or even myself   but things are also looking up, just sent an e-mail to my tribe, so hopefully monetary situations will improve   yay silver-ish lining "
it's good to see my friend <propmale> back to work already   a seven-on-one beating isn't something easy to come back from   glad to see he's taking it in stride 
"sometime, in the somewhat near future, once i can decide upon a subject matter   also, when i get my ass to drawing again   i shall make a shitty little webcomic, called    stronger than cheese!  e playful ect it "
"honestly close to giving up   name tag i've had for over two years, eaten by a lawnmower  finger, damn near destroyed   customers are    mostly fuck heads   and to top it all off, $960 mysteriously disappears from the till when <propmale> and i aren't there for all about a few minutes   life is just so wonderful "
"okay! friggin <propfirst> pulled the money last night and didn't bother to tell me   that's one heart attack i didn't need   but now i find out that we're not only losing our assistant manager, but our service manager <propfemale> too   fucking hell the tragedies just don't stop this week do they?"
"last day!  all i have to do is make it through one more eight hour shift and then i don't have to come in for nine days straight   shame my financial situation isn't a bit better or those nine days might be a bit different   but at least it's a management shift today, those always go by super fast "
"welp, looks like i don't get my vacation this year   <propmale> requested his this week and because of seniority he bumps me   plus the rest of the year is pretty well full booked, so i'm screwed   yay me "
"the time now nears four \i sit here awake still why?\sleep i cannot find "
"instead i post here \nothing gained from what i type \i slip to madness "
"this is my last post \now i shall give it a rest \frying pan aids sleep "
"honestly, it's amazing what a little reflection on your past will do to you   the people you've loved and lost, hurt and been hurt by   there are so many things i'd love to go back and change, so many people i'd wish i hadn't lost   a whole different lifetime i wish i could go back and recapture   i have to wonder just who i've become sometimes   i'm not the person i was even two years ago "
"i can't even say i'll be the same person just two months from now honestly   but it really makes me think about how i've changed and grown as a person   and not everyone in my life is always happy with the changes that happen within me   but really, shouldn't it be my thoughts on my changes that matter?  but really, i never come to a clear, concise decision on how i feel about myself a good 80% of the time "
"i guess what this multi-page rant is about is really not knowing what my life is doing right now   i miss my old carefree life where nothing could hurt me or phase me   but now i dwell on things   i don't know who to trust half the time anymore with anything i say   i just don't know anymore   a good life, love, happiness   isn't that what anyone would want?"
"then why is it that everytime i think i have at least one of those things, someone or something has to come along and take it from me?  or am i just constantly fooling myself into thinking i've found what i want   but i really don't have it and maybe never will?  all i know right now is, it's me against the world, and if you aren't with me, you'll damn sure be against me "
just another obstacle that i have to take down to get what i want   and may god help whomever may choose to stand against me   i'm playing for keeps this time   ready?  set  go 
gah! why must i have to sleep and go to work!?  i just got halo: reach and i can't keep playing   stupid actually having a life!
this is the most active i've been on here in a while   it scares me 
the good pig made wee wee for you 
"just got done watching my first anime movie since ponyo   'the girl who leapt through time', so worth the watch if you ever get the <propmale>   had me laughing, on the brink of tears, and enjoying the heck out of it "
my wall is being written upon quite a bit   but not by me    someone help me    
"well this sucks  of all the days i had to be completely broke, it had to be the day that the new l4d dlc comes out "
"so it locks me out of my account, then all of a sudden i get back in from an e-mail they sent me with a log-in button on it   that makes all the sense in the world! *facepalm*"
"just stayed up til 5 smile 0am watching the karate kid (the new one)   either i need sleep or it was just that good a movie, i'm sitting here on the brink of tears   then again it's been a while since i let myself just up and cry   every time i feel the need to i fight back the tears with some sense of foolish pride   i don't know anymore   troubled sleep, here i come "
"so i think i finally got this thing set for my phone  or at least it isn't trying to ban me for logging in from it  also hotmail is being stupid  bad hotmail, no treat for you "
"okay, i know i have to be productive today   but damn it all, i don't want to be   it's my day off!"
aw screw it   i don't wanna clean my room right now   shower time ho!
well i just got done watching toy story 3   i can definitely see why it had lots and lots of people around my age bawling their eyes out in the theaters   not that they'd admit to it  lol
"me - \so basically you're say that there's absolutely no positive in the world \""\",0aec128528cf58557abcc8efcee587e7,"just got done playing the demo version of <propfirst> pilgrim vs the world   so going to download it once i get paid, am also in the process of downloading the movie   question here is, why haven't i made the effort to watch this sooner?"
"okay, so totally just got done watching <propfirst> pilgrim vs the world   very much worth staying up til 3 smile 0 to watch and only getting five hours of sleep before work   also i believe i shall use google chrome from now on for most of my internetting   it's working rather nicely for me so far "
"also as an interesting side note, my windows live messenger actually defaulted to google chrome when i went to check my e-mail through it   okay, now is time for sleep   right now    well    potty time first   not that you all needed to know that   okay, stopping typing now   "
i swear sometimes i wonder if half these customers have even  half a brain cell between them 
"i feel old now   i was looking at some chat rooms, things i used to go into no problem   now i just can't imagine going into one   what's happened to me?"
"of course it's funny   i used to spend all day in the old msn chat rooms   heck, i met some of my best friends ever there   like <propfemale> and <propfemale>   wasted lots of time in those, almost miss it "
"have you ever wronged someone?  now don't lie   we all have at one point or another   now have you ever carried that guilt with you for years, about five or so years now to be exact?  now the only thing you can think about is trying to find that person and say that you're sorry for what you did to them   well, try as i may, and despite my incredible internetting powers   i simply cannot find this person "
"i'm not even sure they'd want to hear from me ever again, but i've always just wanted to say, i'm sorry   i doubt i'll ever find a way that i can contact them either   not if they don't want me to   but it was wrong to let someone come between our friendship the way that they did   maybe one day i'll get to actually say it to them, but they were one of my best friends   i'll always <propfemale> this guilt "
"interestingly enough, i may have to eat my own words   i think i may have found a way to contact them   question now is, do i?  i want to, but they seem to be doing well for themselves, and the last thing i want to do is remind them of a hurt from the past   oh bother "
"i think what it comes down to is, i'm afraid to be myself   i'm so scared that i won't accomplish what i want, that i won't surround myself with the people that i'd like to   that i rarely let me be me   i always have some front up or some act going   but not always, there are a few that have had the <propmale> to see the real me   honestly i'm surprised they're still around "
"though i guess what i'm really getting at here is, i don't want to be 25   my life isn't what i thought it would be by this age, and i hate myself for it   i hate myself for living at home still, for not having enough money to support myself, for not having someone by my side to share in this life with me   really, i'm scared i'll never have these things   i'm scared, that i'll be a failure "
"you know, i'm really starting to hate how absolutely unphotogenic i am "
"last fm has been my best friend lately   also it's been a horridly emotionally draining day   had a dream that i'm guessing meant my <propfemale> hunkle finally passed away   he just showed up at random, we played, we ate, we laughed   then just before i woke up he got this really sad look on his face   he curled up on my bed and just started purring   i laid down with him, and that was it   i woke up "
"even if that means what i thought it meant, i'll never forget him   my little hunkle <propfemale>, my little brother, my best little friend   my first <propfemale> ever   you'll stay with me forever, no matter what   i love you   love "
"so i'm getting a bit sick of life in general again   i'm thinking of making <propmale> changes   one of those is getting motivated to possibly join up with either the military or the <propmale> police department   but for now, we'll just have to see, won't we?"
can i just say that i really wish i would have been forewarned that i was working at another store today   assholes 
"you know, sometimes it feels like i'm constantly on the outside of life looking in   like that's just how my existence is supposed to go "
"i am currently at work, and currently ready to kill someone  i wonder if there's a connection "
"still sick, throat not exactly being nice   someone kill me!"
"if i've learned anything in my 25 years in this existence, it's always e playful ect to be betrayed   no matter who it is, how you know them, or how much you've come to trust them   but at the same time, always be ready to return their stab to your back, with a dagger in their heart   love "
now is coward killing time!
