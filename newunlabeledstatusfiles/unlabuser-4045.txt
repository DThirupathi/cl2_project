just watched a monkey build a fire 
couldn't be happier that she's been married for a year (and 4 days)!
is gonna name him    hand banana 
has been watching you while you sleep 
remembers some things    she's just not too clear on how she got to be so old and black    why is she black? and why is she wearing this suit? it's ridiculous 
can't wait til tomorrow nighttttt!
"is slightly horrified, but also partially excited, that the semester commences on the morrow "
is salient  but it is not entirely clear what salience is or why it is supposed to be epistemically crucial 
is going to run towards the nearest living thing and kill it
"just laid a thousand of her eggs inside your esophagus  you know, she needs to propagate her species and    you're being a baby about it "
"is not gonna lie, she's pretty goddam excited "
"has hockey hair, yes she does!"
dayquil
is gonna strike low just like her mama taught her 
hates it when you do that!
thinks she's ready 
is so excited she's practically going to throw up
is ready to slit her wrists to see some color 
has a hungry
is    oh look! shiny stuff!
dry mother fuckin mouth
is pretty sure it's cancer 
is being overtaken by visions of being overlooked 
makes the most of her thumbs by becoming a hitchhiker 
"is always up or down, never down and out "
isn't dead yet  come back next week 
wants to crap down your neck 
just wants it dead 
has a great idea  she's gonna wait right here 
wants to lay naked in a truck full of oranges 
"craved, she ate hearts of sharks "
is that voice you're hearing in the hall 
is someone you met who makes you feel sea sick 
knows how it feels to be your age and feel like the world is caving in 
may or maynot be royally fucked
is smarter than the average bear 
knitted you a scarf from the belly of a whale 
would like to thank r  l  stine   this night wouldn't have been possible without him 
is a contamination of reality by dream 
is sick that she's happy but happy that she's sick 
has got a long walk from her house to 309 
wants to take a walk along the perimeter of your heart 
is the <propfemale> to end all nights 
is a twinky cowboy!
is a crooked french canadian 
is the fortress around your heart 
just knocked a giant stack of books over with her butt    dammit 
"bumps into things, she spins around in circles, and she's singing   "
"tried to do handstands for you, but every time she fell on you, and now she's permanently black and blue"
had and lost the one thing she kept in a safe place   
"is locked up like a trophy, forgetting all the things she's done "
never met a tent spike she wouldn't like to put in your stomach 
wants to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart 
will have scars in remembrance of you 
fills up her sails with your wasted breath; each one's more wasted than the others you can bet   
is the last <propmale> standing up against the wall
frak!
woke and she found the voice from her sleep 
"will take you to the top of this building and push you off, then run down the stairs so she can see your face when you hit the street"
is sitting in the bathtub sucking her thumb 
is standing pretty in the dust that was a city 
will be your whatever you want
was thinking about you; there was something she forgot to say   
"just watched the 2006 remake of the cabinet of dr  caligari, while watching the 1919 silent film version at the same time    awesome!"
"bathtub full of glitter and i've got my moose ears on\fisheye front row seat of the field\shake shake that hair out\shake shake that magic doubt\take off trajectory at the tragic factory\eyelet sweaters for everyone\and the black cat too\long face, long sky\spin around, maniac galaxy"
ain't no goddam sonovabitch   
is that funny looking creature who you always <propfemale> around in your heart
watched the plumes paint the sky grey as she laughed and danced through the field of graves   
feels cold and blue and lifeless
the booger that just came out of my nose resembled the embryo of an alien creature
stands in the haze of a lighthouse   
archery
