"long day!!!! emotional roller coaster!!! tired and cant sleep   too much self analysis, would make psych teacher proud!!!"
"oh       tis the season for stupid!!!!! people get mean and dumb this time of year    including me, unfortunately   bad stuff happens to me this time of year  and i hate it!  cant wait for it to be over       "
"wish i had a time machine to go back and undo some of the things i've said and done recently      made some not so smart choices lately, and cant stop feeling like a fool   honesty is not always the best policy!!!!  it can relieve the burden or make it worse       "
tossing and turning with thoughts of broken hearts        and the everlasting damage         
"if you sell your soul to satan, can you get a refund??????????"
