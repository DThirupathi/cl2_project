not a good day 
i'm spending the evening sketching
"my soul is painted like the wings of butterflies,\<propfemale> tales of yesterday, will grow but never die,\i can fly, my friends!"
"some people call me the space cowboy yeah\some call me the gangster of love\some people call me maurice\cause' i speak of the pompetous of love"
another saturday night with just me and my sketchpad   
"my quarterback and ur quarterback r sittin by the fire, my quarterback told ur quarterback i'm gunna make ur a$$ retire, talkn bout who dat who dat!"
