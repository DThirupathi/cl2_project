can't wait til my squish wakes up so we can start packing our summer clothes for florida!
"had a super-fun sleepover with <propfirst> and <propfemale>, complete with cartoons, arting, and living room camping! i need to get a photo of our tent before taking it down    if i even decide to take it down  it's so cozy  smile   love "
"thus far, today has been spent cleaning the kitchen, packing, cleaning & feeding pets, dusting, organizing and more packing  yay productivity! *sneezing my head off, though* 8("
"finished three commissions today, now having some hot chai tea and looking up houses for rent!"
"root canal times 3 tomorrow  i have a horrible phobia of the dentist, so this isn't easy  the only thing keeping me sane is the move to florida by april  hopefully will be sitting in my favorite spot in palm bay with my family and friends for my birthday    i want that more than anything else "
"urgh    root canal is over with    wasn't able to get more done because they sent me home for mangling my own lip  it looks like raw hamburger  i was half conscious and my lip was completely numb, so i didn't have a clue what i was doing  now, the only question is should i take pics to gross people out with "
"i think my lip is infected  i feel very, very weird, weak and awful  "
"feeling much better and excited to spend the next two days packing, cleaning, playing with ratties & watching horror movies with my squish  surprise )"
"want my squish to hurry up and come home so we can have some homnemade garden vegetable soup, then some hot tea, and watch <propmale>'s home whilst snuggled up away from the horrible snow "
would love to plan a big camping trip this april if we've not moved by then  i crave one last camp trip in the mountains 
"my rattie dip may be gone by morning  being  evicted  i don't know what's next  something good, i hope???"
"spent a good 5 hours cleaning my cockroaches' tanks and putting them into smaller containers for the move  i have 20 species, mind you    50+ individuals in each colony  there's gotta be some kind of career for this stuff; i could play with bugs all day long and die a happy clown "
"every day, i hope for good news  the suspense, stress, fear and worry is killing me    i have no idea where i'm going to live in 5 days  i just want my little family to have a happy, sturdy life together  after all this    we deserve it "
"i think i've lost the ability to get excited, but it looks like we might actually be out of here in just a few more days    *crosses fingers, toes, and all 3 eyes*"
"next few days are going to be insane    so much to do before the 15th, after which point we'll be having our power shut off & will be internet-less for several days, possibly a week or more  if anyone wants to send me some nice long messages to come back to once we're all moved and settled in our new home, that would be awesome  surprise )  love "
"stressing out because i told everyone to come over sometime in the afternoon, and i only just woke up at 1 pm! i'm not even close to prepared yet! *rushes around getting everything ready for a 10-person cook-out!* hopefully photos later (o:"
"ahh yesterday went awesomely  made tons of food, played yard games and watched a creepy movie in a pile of stuffed animals   playful  my idea of an awesome party!"
"talked to <propmale> for several hours tonight about a lot of important things that i avoid conversing with anyone about because no one ever takes them seriously  i think it would be a good idea to give a therapist a <propmale> at helping me, as soon as i'm able to afford it "
hello internet  just letting you know i have eaten an entire bag of peanut butter chips in a mere 2 days 
"i now have three white's tree frogs! the first one was named fats, but he is now ironically the least fat  naming the new ones ortin (named after the purple fungus, cortinarius archeri, as he was deep bluish-purple when i got him) and egon  because    egon  x) hopefully at least one of them is female   !"
"can't decide whether i want to go to bed, or make some hot tea, sit on the porch in my new socks, draw, and enjoy the morning  desperately want to take a trip to the beach one more time before the oil spill gets to us and kills everything   surprise ("
i could really use a distraction from my shitty mood today  i feel like i've been couped up in this house too long doing nothing but working on commissions to save up for a car i'll never have   woe
slept good  feel better  it feels weird to wake up in the morning instead of right as the sun is going down  so nervous excited about getting jax today! he'll likely be on his way to me in the next few hours 
"i cleaned my first iguana poop  we bonded  i petted him under his <propfemale> and his eyes went closed  he really wants out of his cage now, but he needs a few more days to adjust and relax, then i'll take him out lots   love "
"concerned for jax  he had a thick callus on his front leg which came off and now there's a smooth fleshy area with a bit of dried blood  sad  he won't let me touch it, and he seems more lethargic than usual, so i'm thinking it's time for a potentially e playful ensive vet visit  i've only had him a few days and i already feel like a bad iggy mommy  sad "
jax keeps tearing open his wound  vet imminent  i seem to be the only person who sees it as an emergency 
"i am so relieved that the vet visit went so well  smile  jax was a sensation at the office; everyone was fawning over him and taking photos  apparently his wound isn't as bad as i thought and it should heal nicely  the vet seemed impressed that i knew as much as i did about iguanas    though i'm not sure if that says something about me, or the other people who come in with pets and don't know their shit!  playful "
"went to see <propfemale> in wonderland again at the dollar theater with <propfirst>, <propmale>, <propmale>, <propfemale>, <propfemale> and my squish, then <propmale> around <propmale>'s house a bit and played with their awesome cats and the frabjous pup! tuckered out  all in all a great day (o:"
"so who wants to come to my birthday party??? my b-day is the 21st (summer solstice)   come hungry, & bring an extra set of clothes  water balloon fights & other kiddy water games imminent!!! also, it's likely to be an outdoor sleep-over party for those who aren't wussies; complete with tent, spooky stories & burnt marshmallows  i'm hoping this will be a birthday filled with all the childish things that i love  surprise )"
