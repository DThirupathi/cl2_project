"if life ended tomorrow, how would you spend ur last days"
its the weekend and i dont have anything to do   what a boring place to be 
is missing home right now
no more mr  nice guy hes gone for good
back in texas
can't wait till the next time i can climb a tower
wondering why every girl i get with is pshco
is tired of people disrespecting the military   if you dont like us putting our lives on the line so you can sleep in peace at nite   then you are in the wrong country 
ask not what ur country can do for u but what  u can do for ur country
