happy new years!! ^^
needing a makeover
business or culinary   that is the question 
~ loving his night vision pic ~
i am mad as hell > sad 
"\hearts are beating faster and nothing could be hotter\"""""
what am i gonna do now   
"there's nothing else i can do, than fall for you "
my nerves are so shot   v_v
way too much drama  - -
"~smile, it makes people wonder what you're thinking "
~a balanced diet is a cookie in each hand 
shin: a device for finding furniture in the dark 
~laughter is when a smile has an orgasm 
"i can feel the invisible connection between us  i know you can <propfemale>derstand me like no other, and i can see past your skin into your soul  even though we have never met, i know you better then i know myself  i can feel your pain from worlds apart, and you can see my <propfemale> shed tears  each day without you is an eternity, endless are my nights  living, i am in a dream yet to be realized, barely holding on to it "
"blooming roses, crimson petals stained with transparent memories  thorns caress the skin of my palm, rain cascades as a waterfall  reflections of you and me, mirrored as if by the ocean  roses decorate the garden of my dreams  you waltz to me with your dream flower, petals adorned with tears and love  rain cascades as a waterfall, embrace me now and never let go "
~never wanted to dance with nobody but you 
"~give me one firm spot on which to stand, and i will move the earth "
"why have i suffered, almost the same blows such countless times? but even so, i'll probably fight again, for that is one of lifes mysteries  i want to overcome the ceaseless pain in my chest and become closer to you  i have wandered about once and returned  falling in love, saying goodbye    with a vow that this is the last heartbreak "
kremlings  love 
"\reaching as i fall  \"""""
"we can fight our desires, but when we start making fires we get ever so hot whether we like it or not  they say we can love who we trust, but what is love without lust? two hearts with accurate devotions, and what are feelings without emotions?"
"the heart dies a slow death, shedding each hope like leaves  until one  day there are none "
i just love rumors!! i always learn new stuff i didn't know about  myself   laugh 
after monday and tuesday even the calendar says w t f 
"i wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be, a little gambling is fun when you're with me, i love it  russian roulette is not the same without a gun, and baby when it's love if its not rough it isn't fun "
"i get off on you getting off on me,\give you what you want\but nothing is for free \it's all give and take the kinda life we make,\when your line is crossed\i get off "
"there is no <propmale>, only zuul "
"if it is written in the stars, then it can be read\for this is prophecy\the future\a thousand million possibilities\is it my <propfemale>?"
"i want to thank everyone for the happy birthday, it means a lot to me  love ya all!  love "
"the sudden summer rain, \passed by my tears in a quiet stream \a scene so like one from my memories \a summer re-run of a fall drama "
"much unlike a mortal\who hurts the ones they love\a dragon's love is forever\and as pure as a peaceful dove"
"think i'm here for all the wrong reasons, can't do it wrong when you don't do a thing  once in love, it's more like a habit  guess that's what i need, to feel like me "
i look in the mirror everyday  i see the past and memories  i want it to end  i want to be different and leave my old self behind  i want to change   *wonders if he should dye his hair*
*wishing someone would love him*
