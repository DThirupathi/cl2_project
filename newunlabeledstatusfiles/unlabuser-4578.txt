i don't pretend to know what love is for everyone but i can tell you what it is for me love is knowing all about someone and still wanting to be with them more than any other person love is trusting them enough to tell them everything about yourself including the things you might be ashamed of love is feeling comfortable and safe with someone but still getting weak knees when they walk into a room and smile at you
