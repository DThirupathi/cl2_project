"going to read some hp and then take a nap before going to the gym  feel like i've gotten no sleep today, never again will i schedule appointments that i have to be up at 10 a m  when i don't get to bed til 7 a m "
thinking that having wine after a 12 hour shift yesterday and not getting to bed until 9 smile 0am kind of hindered me switching over to being awake during the day  but it was worth it!
