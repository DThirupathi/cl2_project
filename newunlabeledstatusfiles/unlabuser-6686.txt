"over 23,000 teachers were given pink slips in ca, 14,000 in ny & 17,000 in il  nj & florida are cutting teacher jobs & reducing salaries  we need to get our priorities in order  athletes get paid millions, but teachers who we trust to help raise & educate our kids get no respect! in honor of all teachers, copy & paste"
