"so like omg i' waiting to get picked up to go to the dentist \bah, it takes forever there, so my impatience goes off the walls!"
"yup, just got back from the dentist, and bing, i have no cavities! they just said to floss more often  heh, they misspelled my name tag as \mtichell becker\"""""

"hahah, i took a 5-hour energy drink during the middle of my first class today  \ it was awful and bitter, but it worked great! however, i got tired again at the middle of my last class, gym  that, or it could be because i raced the whole class and made sure i stayed ahead of everyone  my chest stung after that   "

"yay, i have proactive now! i hope it works  smile "
"i got my work doneeeeee! well, at least everything due tomorrow  i still have some stuff that's due at a later time, but whatever! and wtf is so cool about morphsuits? it's a popular thing, especially on facebook apparently, but i think they're pointless"
"well, today was a pleasant day, and my friends were awesome and i felt so clear minded  i feel like i'm making progress in life of some sort, i dunno  regardless, i have to return to homework now though  bye bye!"
"i'm about to play <propfemale> ocean till the end of time    but not till the end of time, cause' i have school tomorrow "
"well, today has been a mixture of satisfaction, uniqueness with a balance between calm and energetic "
let's all make this a spring break of productivity and self-attentiveness!
"oh yeah, and it's my mom's birthday today  smile "
"i feel very calm and content right now  i got to <propfemale> out with davaughn (who most of you don't know) for the first time, which was really nice  spring break has been amazing so far   "
"ah, it's the first day of my favorite month of the year in my favorite season    april 1st!"
"meh, i feel so blank today and my micro sd card stopped working so i can't play my ds games or draw with \colors!\"" and it's cold and i feel blank-minded today  sad \",254b9220d1e0487ece50ff6095469b25,"storms make me tired, ergo, i am a bit tired  howeverrrr, school starts back up again tomorrow and it feels like it has been forever! i'm in the mood to see my friends again "
"yeah, i just got home from working at my grandpa <propfirst>'s house   i basically moved from the weight room at school to raking his big yard, so i'm pretty exausted and i have blisters on my hand form not wearing gloves  sad "
"okay, i have 2 blisters on my hand, i'm a <propmale> bit sunburnt, my proactive is working slower than i want it to, i pulled my arm shoulder muscle in gym, and i got kicked in the chest  i'm just gettin' all kinds of hurt x< i'm wondering who i can <propfemale> out with this weekend, i'd prefer either davaughn, <propfemale>, <propfirst>, or <propfemale> "
