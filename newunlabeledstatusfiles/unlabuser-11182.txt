"that's what real love amounts to - letting a person be \what he really is  most people love you for who you pretend to be  to \keep their love, you keep pretending, performing  you get to love your \pretence  it's true, we're locked in an image, an act "

never hurtin' and that's for certain 
why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door? with a thousand million questions about hate and death and war  'cause when we stop and look around there is nothing that we need in a world of persecution that is burning in its greed 
"i do my thing, and you do your thing  i am not in this world to live up to your e playful ectations, and you are not in this world to live up to mine  you are you, and i am i, and if by <propmale> we find each other, it's beautiful "
"school sucks, man  annoyed  but when i get home today, i'm gonna make a bunch of popcorn and watch all the episodes of planet earth  laugh "
"we've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant  you can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself  you've got to keep watering it  you've got to really look after it and nurture it "
"from dehumanization to arms production to hasten this nation towards its destruction  power is power, the law of the land  those living for death will die by their own hand  life's no ordeal if you come to terms, reject the system dictating the norms  from dehumanization to arms production to hasten this nation towards its destruction  it's your choice: peace or annihilation "
"a few minutes ago every tree was excited, bowing to \the roaring storm, waving, swirling, tossing their branches in glorious \enthusiasm like worship  but though to the outer ear these trees are now\ silent, their songs never cease "

"i will never be afraid again  i will keep on fighting till the end  i can walk on water, i can fly  i will keep on fighting till i die "
i like how i always wake up at 5 in the morning and can't go back to sleep  annoyed 
"okay, either i'm going insane or i hear someone playing bagpipes?"
we don't deserve this planet    we're destroying everything and most people couldn't care less  i just do not understand

"all that we are is the result of what we have thought  if a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him  if a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him  ~buddha"
"had a wonderful day alll day with my baby  love  thanksgiving tomorrow, gonna get superrrr baked all day & get my grub on, fuck yessss!  laugh "
i need about tree fiddy 
i wish everyone has a delicious & delightful thanksgiving  smile 
holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned 
"there is no fire like passion, no crime like hatred, no sorrow like separation, no sickness like hunger, and no joy like the joy of freedom "
"it's unfortunate how many people stay in relationships that they are truly not happy with    some people need to realize they are not going to find their fucking soul mate when they are so young, others need to realize that they are strong, wonderful individuals who would be so much happier without the everyday stress and everyday pain they have to deal with "
"if you don't drink or drugs, what do you do for fun?"
bitches love smiley faces     smile

"if you wanna do this number thing, send me a number quick because i'm not gonna be doing it for long !!!!"
"#3 - even though we haven't really <propmale> out yet, i can tell we're going to become good friends  we already have so much to talk about and you seem so incredibly friendly  i'm glad we started talking and i can't wait until we get to <propfemale> out, and i hope we get to soon!  smile  you are beautiful!"
"#420 (first) - we've known each other since i was in elementary school and you've c<propfemale>ed so much since then, but i think it's definitely for the best  you're an amazing person and you seem to try to do everything you can for friends you truly care about - i really like that about you  i enjoy whenever we <propfemale> out and i think we need to <propfemale> out much more often  love "
"13 - you have been in my life from before i can remember  we used to do the stupidest things but we would always have so much fun  you were the first person i ever e playful erienced crazy shit with and i will never forget all that we went through  i wish we were still as close as we used to be, you were one of the few girls who was actually a true friend  i love you so much, always have & always will  love  i can't deny it!"
"420 (second) - ever since the second i saw you i thought you were absolutely gorgeous, and you can speak a sexy foreign language  i'm lucky to know you and have you in my life because you're absolutely amazing! you're so fun to be around and i'm always there for you whenever you need some cheering up or some smoking out  wink  i love you!"
"251 - i honestly didn't think you would message me for this, but we used to be much closer than we are now and i don't know why that is  you're a great person and a lot of fun to be around! you really know how to get the party going when needed, but you also have your feet on the ground and are a successful person  i'm glad to have met you, even if we hardly ever talk "
"718 - i wanted to meet you since the first time i saw you on facebook  you are absolutely gorgeous! i was so happy to meet you when i did and i like hanging out with you but i'm still kinda shy around you  i wanna get to know you better because you seem like an amazing person! we should get drunk together sometime, it seems like the easiest and best way  wink  stay awesome, stay beautiful  love "
"8 - you are so much fun to be around and i knew you would be from the second i saw you! you seem to always have an optimistic outlook and i like that because not many people do  i don't think you should take shit from your mom like you do, but i probably don't know the full situation so i probably have no room to talk  anyway, you seem fuckin' awesome & i'd like to get to know you better and party with you sometime "
"354 - you are an amazing person  i remember we used to be the closest of friends and i don't know what happened but we stopped talking  sad  i know we'll always have each other's back though and i hope we can have a <propmale> to become the great friends we used to be again, because i miss talking to you & having you in my life  your son is beautiful, i know you're an excellent mommy  smile  i miss you so much  love "
"12 - you're a pretty awesome guy  i wouldn't have my ipod if it weren't for you  we haven't <propmale> out or talked in a really long time but i still think you're a pretty cool guy  i hope everything in life is going just swell for you; <propfemale> may be out to get you, but i know you're a good person so i hope everything works out for the best "
"69 - you're a cool guy  we don't talk as much as we used to since i'm no longer at buchanan and that kinda saddens me  you were always a great person to <propfemale> out with at lunch and just talk about music and random shit  you were also always there in the mornings when i was way too baked to talk, hahah  i miss seeing you at school everyday  i hope everything's going well for you "
1414 - we were never very close but you were never an asshole to me so we're cool  we don't talk at alllllll since i'm not at buchanan anymore and i think we should change that because i like having lots of friends  smile 
"14 - you are such a beautiful person, inside and out  i hear a lot of people talk shit about you and it disappoints me because i know they don't even really know you  you're really fun to <propfemale> out with and i miss you a lot  we should talk more, because we could be good friends again  i love you! i hope you're happier than you were the last time we spoke  love "
"okay done with the stupid number shit, i've showed enough love  love "

"let us be grateful to people who make us happy, they are the charming gardeners who make our souls <propfemale>  love  enjoying an unbelievably delicious omlette before getting ready for my day  although it's grey and cloudy outside, the sun is constantly shining in my mind  life is good!"
"each morning i open my eyes and say to myself: i, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today  i can choose which it shall be  yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn't arrived yet  i have just one day, today, and i'm going to be happy in it "
"happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn, or consumed  happiness is the spiritual e playful erience of living every moment with love, grace, and gratitude "
those who can laugh without cause have either found the true meaning of happiness or have gone stark raving mad    i think i'm somewhere in between  playful 
"if there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have a paradise in a few years "
happy christmas to everyone  love  i hope everyone's day is filled with joy 
"and every time the <propfemale> shines, i become alive "
oh today should be a wonderful day  laugh  !!!
"you need to learn to be happy by nature, because you'll seldom have the <propmale> to be happy by circumstance "
"fuck mainstream, fuck the norm, and fuck conformity "
don't rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth  only you can be responsible for that  if you can't love and respect yourself - no one else will be able to make that happen  accept who you are - completely; the good and the bad - and make changes as you see fit - not because you think someone else wants you to be different 
"it's time like these i need relief  please show me how, please show me how to get by "
"the reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was, the present worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will be   "
"strawberrry weeeeeed cupcakes, mmmm  smile "
"don't wait until everything is just right  it will never be perfect  there will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions  so what  get started now  with each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled, more and more self-confident and more and more successful "
"new zodiac sign dates? trippin' me the fuck out  i'm staying a virgo, i don't give a fuck "
bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
"happiness comes from spiritual wealth, not material wealth    happiness comes from giving, not getting  if we try hard to bring happiness to others, we cannot stop it from coming to us also  to get joy, we must give it, and to keep joy, we must scatter it "
"i was thinking to myself, \this could be heaven or this could be hell \"""""
"far away in the sunshine are my highest aspirations  i may not reach them, but i can look up and see their beauty, believe in them, and try to follow where they lead "
i hate <propfirst> shackelford > sad 
there are some days when i think i'm going to die from an overdose of satisfaction!
"optimist: person who travels on nothing from nowhere to happiness    aka <propfemale> hamner  wink  people need to realize that americans don't have real problems so they make up shit to be upset about so they have something to bitch about and i'm fucking sick of it! goddamn, just be fucking happy, it's seriously not that hard!"
"people should have more important things to say rather than documenting every single thought you have  get a life, kids!"
"you have brains in your head \you have feet in your shoes \you can steer yourself in any direction you choose \you're own your own \and you know what you know \you are the guy who'll choose where to go "
"in response to those who say to stop dreaming and face reality, i say keep dreaming and make reality "
"you've got a lot of choices  if getting out of bed in the morning is a chore and you're not smiling on a regular basis, try another choice "
success isn't a result of spontaneous combustion    you must set yourself on fire!
"don't take my kindness as a weakness, you fake ass bitches can't fuck with me "
as long as i'm alive i'ma live illegal 
"i missss my boyfriend already! this big bed of mine gets so lonely without him to cuddle with    oh well, at least i have mr  marley here by my side all the time  smile  goodnight, fb! it's been a wonderful friday "
i'm cooler than that cheetah from the commercials 
"donâ€™t do drugs because if you do drugs youâ€™ll go to prison, and drugs are really e playful ensive in prison    time to take a toke or two and watch <propfirst> & silent <propmale> strike back! by the way, my boyfriend is amazing  smile  goodnight!"
it really puzzles me to see marijuana connected with narcotics dope and all that stuff   it is a thousand times better than whiskey; it is an assistant and a friend 
"if you want your dreams to come true, the first thing you must do is wake up!"
the road of life is <propmale> and you may stumble too   so why are you pointing fingers when someone els is judging you? could you be loved?
hangovers suck!!!  sad  why am i awake? going back to sleep    after getting medicated!

reggae music puts my soul at ease  love  thank goodness for this beautiful weather; i was going to go insane if there was another 24-hour period of rain!
"rainbow country - a country where all races can live together in unity as one, forming the most beautiful country in existence    i hope one day rainbow country will be earth "
love songs from the 60s bring me sunshine even on gloomy days like this  smile 
you have to deal with the thunderstorm to see the rainbow  love 
love is my religion!
so i've decided that i like blunts    but only when they're the size of a cigar  smile 
"life is one big road with lots of signs    so when you're riding through the ruts, don't complicate your mind  flee from hate, mischief, and jealousy  don't bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality  wake up and live!"
hoping for the best     annoyed 
"cause all my life i've been waiting for, i've been praying for the people to say that we don't wanna fight no more, there will be no more wars and our children will play    one day!"
i'm seriously convinced i belong in a different generation  people my age these days are so dumb!
"it doesn't matter if you're black or white, the only color that really matters is green  wink "
"i wish my boyfriend was here to cuddle    my cat just isn't cutting it as a cuddle <propmale> anymore, he's too much of a damn flea bag!  sad  they're eating me aliveeee!"
"my agenda for the day: most importantly foood, shower, cleaning a bit, laundry, gym? i really wanna do something i've never done before, but i don't think that's happening today  life is way too short to keep the \same shit - different day\"" routine! i need to wake up & live!"""
but i ain't too pretty to slap a hoe so all you girls acting shitty bettaaa hit the back door!
