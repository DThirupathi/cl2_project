happy new year everyone! hope this year is better than last year
god <propmale> me the serenity  to accept the things i cannot change;  courage to change the things i can; and wisdom to know the difference 
sometimes i wish i was a little girl because bruised knees heal faster than broken hearts
"i believe that everything happens for a reason  people change so that you can learn to let go  things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right  you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together  <propfemale> <propmale>"
let it snow let it snow let it snow! well off to <propfemale>'s for ufc party!
can't wait for the snow let it snow! let it snow! let it snow!
