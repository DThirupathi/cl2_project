"where do we go from here?\how do we <propfemale> on?\i can't get beyond the questions \clambering for the scraps\in the shatter of us collapsed \it cuts me with every could-have-been \\pain on pain on play, repeating\with the backup makeshift life in waiting "
"u make me hard when i'm all soft inside \i see the truth when i'm all stupid-eyed \the arrow goes straight throught my heart"
"here i lay\still and breathless\just like always\still i want some more\mirrors sideways"
"you will be the death of me\you will be the death of me\\bury it\i won't let you bury it\i won't let you smother it\i won't let you murder it\\our time is running out\our time is running out\you can't push it underground"
"thereâ€™s a possibility\thereâ€™s a possibility\all that i had was all iâ€™m gonâ€™ get \thereâ€™s a possibility\thereâ€™s a possibility\all i gonâ€™ get is gonâ€™ be yours then\all i gonâ€™ get is gonâ€™ be yours still \so tell me when you hear my heart stop"
"sometimes\i wish i was brave\i wish i was stronger\i wish i could feel no pain"
"ok then, guess that is that and i am done   wow   so many breaks   time to move on   so much love to people in the past   but it's over i guess   gotta get ready for the future   future love, future friends   please come find me soon!  sad "
