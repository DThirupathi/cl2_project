"dear ib gods, if my computer just types up my world lit one just out of nowhere, then i will be very happy and will get to sleep  i will take it as proof of your dominance of the universe and worship you for the rest of my life  i will start a church and make sacrafices of exemplary english papers and physics labs if only my wli would finish itself  please oh great ib, please   \\your humble servant, tate"
"i really wish the lightning would stike my house  if it did, my computer would be fried so i would not have to work on my history ia or world lit one  then i would be able to go to sleep "
likes how there are a bunch of <propmale> kids on  how are your wli's coming?
"dear district 20, to be honest i never really liked you  you've always done all the horrible things to our class  but having school this late is absolutely rediculous  i'm tired, stressed, and losing my sanity  haven't you tortured us enough? i mean seriously, what you're doing is just inhumane  but i would be willing to forgive that if school just ended tomorow, so please, just let it end "
i just had my last class with gc! salvation at last!!!
"i'm feeling it in my bones, this could definitely turn into an all nighter "
two days left!!!!!! only two more days  and not even full days!!!!!
just went running for the first time in a few months (thank you ib for that i hope you go die in a hole) and it reminded me exactly how long its been  ouch 
i seem to have made it a habit to go running in the hottest part of the day 
the <propmale> of flyin glies in the ability to throw yourself at the ground and miss
god's final message to his creation: we are sorry for the inconvenience
"oh  that's right  ib scores are out       i want to check them, but i don't want to know      "

i wonder what would happen if i went all of band camp without showering        
yes!!!!! my sock tan line is officially as bad or worse than my dad's sock tan line!!!!
with each day of band camp i am less tired and less sore afterward         i don't understand it
if pain is weakness leaving the body then what's getting stronger when sunburns start hurting?
i just realized how bad people are at driving here 
i'm begining to think that the roofers are trying to bring our house down  they seem to be dropping multiple heavy objects on our roof and the house shakes every time that they do 
my trigger finger is still sore from last night
done with fountainhead and first draft of extended essay  that means tomorrow gets to be my first carefree day of summer 
hey in twelve hours we'll all be in school  joyousness
why couldn't you have stabbed me in the heart with a dagger? it would have hurt less 
never ending pasta bowl is the best idea anybody ever had 
"i hate my life  i found the list of possible fountainhead essay topics that i so desperately wanted for inspiration, after i was finished writing my thesis and making it look pretty"
the check in desk had just got fundamentally fed up with being where it was
i have no clue what to do with myself today without marching band
i love spicy foods  but i draw the line when its so spicy that your taste buds are burned away and you can no longer taste the food 
gotta love procrastination
my dog is becoming part of our sofa
"you know, i actually really like my extended essay "
yes i get my car back tomorrow!!!!
i would like another kiva juice
i'm considering growing my beard out
i hate my life  and my family isn't helping
"why do i hate gold days so much? i mean i have physics, my favorite class, and history which has mr  e who is a beast  it makes no sense but i still hate them"
soooooo i got accepted into mines  things have been going well for me lately 
ok why do we never have any good snacks?
i'm done with my second draft for ee!
it just kinda hit me now that this is my last year in high school and i have so many friends that i'm really going to miss next year
"ah what an amazing night, of course that was too be e playful ected"
ok so i really don't want to write this commentary  i feel like procrastinating a bit more      
the lack of anything good to eat in my house is astounding 
so i have a sweet lucrative job now that's as good if not better than my old sweet lucrative job  smile 
i'm going to start a band called green wetsuit device
i hate snow  why can't it just die 
so today sucked and it only managed to get worse 
i love colorado
lack of sleep is making me quite lightheaded right now 
my sister is such a spoiled brat 
hooly crap towers of midnight has been out for almost a month!!! and i haven't bought it and read it!!!! how did this happen?????????
so i just turned the alarm on my phone on  that was about the most painful thing ever 
can school be over yet?
coffee number 2 of many tonight
my calculator is mia
"there is something seriously wrong in my life\\i have no coffee in front of me  this must be fixed immediately "
"type your name: tate krejci\with your elbow:tate krfejcji\with your nose: tate krejci\with your eyes closed:tate krejci\now post it as your status and don't erase your mistakes!!!"
only 15 and 1 2 hours and we'll be on break
you know you're bored when you play yourself at axis and allies    
goodmorning world on the last day of 2010
if you want to make a pie from scratch you need to create a universe first 
so i thought the most painful moment of my life was when i had to turn my alarm back on after thanksgiving break         at least until i turned it on today
time to start counting the days until spring break
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! facebook has forced the new profile on me and there was a very good reason that i didn't switch on my own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
"lair you're killing me  honestly i'm going to forget all of this poetry stuff as soon as the test is over tomorrow, not because i'm dissing poetry, but because the differense between an ottava <propfemale> and a spenserian stanza have no bearing on my life whatsoever and i find it impossible to make myself care even in the slightest "
"if the population of the earth continued to increase at its present rate indefinitely, by 3530 a d  the total mass of human flesh and blood would equal the mass of the earth  by 6826 a d  it would equal the mass of the known universe "
i've sucessfully analyzed the hell out of this poem and i actually enjoyed it
