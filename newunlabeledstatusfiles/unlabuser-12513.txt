"â€œthere comes a time when you have to stand up and shout:this is me damn it! i look the way i look, think the way i think, feel the way i feel, love the way i love! i am a whole complex package  take me or leave me accept me - or walk away! do not try to make me feel like less of a person, just because i don't fit your idea of who i should be and don't try to change me to fit your mold "
"â€œall our young lives we search for someone to love  we choose partners, change partners    all the while wondering if there's someone, somewhere, searching for us â€�"
"â€œif i never met you, i wouldn't like you  if i didn't like you, i wouldn't love you  if i didn't love you, i wouldn't miss you  but i did, i do, and i will â€�"
"â€œi'm not supposed to love you? i'm not supposed to care? i'm not supposed to live my life wishing you were here? i'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you do?   i'm sorry i can't help myself, i'm in love with you â€�"
"distance never separates two hearts that really care, for our memories span the <propmale> and in seconds we are there  but whenever i start feeling sad, because i miss you, i remind myself how lucky i am to have someone so special to miss "

"sheâ€™s beauty, style, poise and grace,\at least she appears to be \but no one knows the girl who hides\behind the face they see \\her self-esteem is all but gone,\of her ego thereâ€™s barely a trace \thereâ€™s so much pain behind the mask\she wears upon her face \\depression has controlled her life\with far too many tears,\her smile is fake; sheâ€™s good at it,\sheâ€™s been doing it for years "

"along with trustworthiness, consistency is the thing to look for when you surround yourself with people who can help you on your quest      \       - <propfirst> <propmale>"
you have the power to think what you want  no matter what the circumstance 
"you learn as much from those who have failed as from those who have succeeded \       - <propfirst> <propmale>"
"you owe it to yourself to find your own unorthodox way of succeeding, or sometimes, just surviving "
it is clearly not the journey for everyone  people succeed in as many ways as there are people  some can be completely fulfilled with destinations that are much closer to home and more comfortable to within a whisper of your own personal perfection  to places that are sweeter because you worked so hard to arrive there  to places at the very edge of your dreams 
deficiency motivation doesn't work  it will lead to a life-long pursuit of try to fix me  learn to appreciate what you have and where and who you are 
i have the best family !!! had a great labor day weekend!!! now its time to find my apt!!! hope to find one sooner then soon!!!
one word frees us of all the weight and pain of life  that word is love
"its not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters "
holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one getting burned 
faith is to believe that which you do not yet see ; and the reward of this faith is to see that which you believe 
"my family is weird!!! \ smile "
life is what u make it! i love my family and friends!
