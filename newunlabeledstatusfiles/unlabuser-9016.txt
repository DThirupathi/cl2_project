    reasons why i hate spring break    1  there is free time    too much free time    so much that it really doesn't exist  2  homework     3  work+papers to write+boyfriend= procrastination! 4  everyone else is also on break and demanding i spend time with them 5  everything happens of break    to the point that i can get nothing done!!!! (oh and happy birthday lexi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^)

"while you scream at your woman, there's aman wishing he could whisper softly in her ear    while youhumiliate,offend & insult her, there's a man flirting with her& reminding her how wonderful she is  while you hurt your woman,there's a man wishing he could make love to her  while you make yourwoman cry there's a man stealing smiles from her!! post this on yourwall if you're against domestic abuse "

he who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the lord  proverbs 18:22
really fell sick right now  i'm so not looking forward to tomorrow     crying 
well i go in for my oral surgery at 8 this morning  doubt that i will be back on here today    scared out of my wits and really just wishing this was over   crying 
well i'm awake now  starting to feel the pain  this stupid gauze is driving me crazy i'll be glad when the bleeding stops 
okay  think i'm done with the gauze  on the other hand my mouth hurts and i have another hour till i can take more pain meds    i miss my wisdom already     crying 
well still feeling bad today  nauseas and tired  plus it feels like someone punched me in both jaws  at least i was able to eat a small something today (about half a scrambled egg and 1 4 of a cup of jello)   yesterday i went 25 hours with nothing but water (followed by 1 4 cup of jello)  i will be glad when i can eat reall food again 
i don't feel so good   
"i ate some more scrambled eggs so i'm not quite so shaky now  still in pain (it is an annoying kind of pain, like i got hit in the face) but popping the pills again so that should fade away "
well woke up this morning and the left side felt like my jaw was gonna fall off  got some pain meds in me now so i'm starting to feel better  had <propmale> n' cheese for breakfast and let me tell you it was a nice change from eggs and jello 
"feeling a bit better, mostly just tired from the pain meds and upset tummy  at least the pain meds are keeping my mouth pain to a minimum "
everything is feeling better now except that one side  just a little longer and i can take more pain meds   
went back to the oral surgeon this morning  he says everything looks fine and that the pain i'm having is normal  so now i just need to eat something  i've lost 7lbs since the procedure of monday   
"okay  i'm so tired  it is amazing how much energy your body uses when it is healing    mom is trying to remind me to eat more    i keep getting upset stomach and she claims its from not eating enough with my meds  she is probably right, but i still don't enjoy eating right now "
wish i was on the top of someones list instead of second or third like it appears i have been  so ready for life to get better 
"peppermint hot chocolate  now that is comfort food \~over looked~"
"starbucks plus a good friend equals a very content me \~over looked~"

"going to walmart to do some shopping  ^^\~tired~"
well did most of my shopping today  i have a few things left to get but i'm almost done  not looking forward to monday but that is life   
"should not have take that pain pill before church  cant keep my eyes open   \~tired~"
"waiting on people can get old after about 5 hours  ^^\~tired~"
feeling like crap right now  physically and emotionally exhausted  trying to eat some comfort food even tho it is killing my mouth to do so    if i don't i'm gonna break   
its sad but i'm already ready for classes to start back up again  i don't know why but this year christmas just isn't going very well   
"ok  here we go  out with the stitches   \~tired~"
about to finish present wrapping  all that is left is <propfemale>'s gifts and buying stocking stuffers and a gift for <propfemale>   
emptiness    what more can i say?
starting to think i'm suffering from depression    i'm feel so empty 
well i have been informed that the pain meds i took for my oral surgery are also narcotics that cause depression  so while i now know why i feel this way i can't un-feel it 
actually looking forward to work tonight  it will give me a <propmale> to not think  starting to rethink everything  its amazing how invisible i can be until something goes wrong   
   
"having a rough night, really tired of people  really thankful to <propfemale> for her support today (its nice to know i'm not the only one that goes through this stuff)  still not happy with quite a few people but you know what i really don't care about it anymore  we will just see what happens tomorrow   "
"i hate it when my mind is so busy i cant sleep  im soooo tired   sad \~tired~"

"really not happy right now  i'm calmer now, but still pissed off  i will be glad when friday gets here, i won't be so stressed once i get my books (not having them is driving me crazy)"
well got up without feeling tired  did a little yoga and practice some bollywood dance moves  feeling much better this morning and actually feel like i'm ready for work  going in a lil early to eat breakfast and hopefully i'll get off by about 5  whoot whoot! and then i will visit my sis since she is sick (tonsillitis)
alright a total of 8lbs lost  i know not that great but that means i only have 12 more to meet my goal for the next 6 months (as long as i can keep it off) so i guess some good came out of my teeth being removed    it jump started the fact that i don't need to eat like i used to 
today has been the most productive this week it feels like  going to get my books tomorrow!!! it will be so nice to have that out of the way  i hope i feel this good tomorrow too  ^ ^

5 deadly terms used by a woman: 1) fine-this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are right and you need to shut up  2) nothing-means something and u need to be weary  3) go ahead-this is a dare not permission do not do it  4) whatever-is a woman's way of saying forget you! 5) that's ok-she is thinking long and hard on how and when you will pay for your mistake  **re-post if u agree**
