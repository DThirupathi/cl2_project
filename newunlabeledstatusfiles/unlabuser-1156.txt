my father just had a massive heart attack this evening   i just found out   not looking really good right now   he is back in surgery   trying to think positive but i'm really worried  
"my dad finally made it out of the icu and onto a telemetry floor   hoping for a discharge later this week   honestly   i just want this awful week to be over   brief synopsis    me- bronchitis, dad- heart attack, jenny ally puking, us afraid we will puke or make dad puke, mom mri on brain, mom's dog dying (getting put to sleep tomorrow)   sorry friends and fam, christmas cards aren't happening this year  "
dad was finally discharged today thank goodness   i'm holding him hostage at my house for awhile   trying to convince someone with a strong personality that they are not invincible isn't always easy   getting over the denial that one is not invincible isn't easy either   baby steps  
"lego building, kitchen cleaning, turkey cooking, dad is sleeping    its a low key christmas for the first time in my house   and for the first time, i'm fine with that   <propfemale> christmas to all my friends and family, and thanks to all of you that have been so wonderful during this challenging time   it really means a lot to me  smile "
"at last   a day off tomorrow  bringing dad to scranton for blood work, then hopefully a relaxing evening at home   everybody and every <propfemale> needs some love "
