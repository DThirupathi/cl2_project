for all of you who think that i've become more mean since basic training or i've gotten bold since basic     well you clearly didn't know me before  my real friends can attest to the fact that i was more likely to say or do something hurtful than i am now  so if anything i've learned restraint but i will still always keep it real! so go complain to someone who cares  <propfemale> on fb

this old man can't boil water but in here yelling at me trying to tell me how to cook  thank god for <propfemale> and restraint  lmbo!
sometimes when you take advice from your friends they are only helping you miss out on your happiness  that's why you have to know who you are calling a friend and know when their advice is from the heart and when it is spiteful 
"i hope all of you conscious, down for the cause, fight the power negros went out to vote today   if you didn't and i find out i will put your perpetrating behinds on blast  mmhmm  i'm talking to you "
sometimes when you really love someone the hardest thing to do is tell them that they're screwing up their life  especially when they are so happy doing it  so do i just sit back and watch a friend permanently damage themselves for temporary pleasures?
is screaming like publisher's clearing house just showed up to my door! yippey!

i was dormant but you awakened something inside me

"#2 well let's say i think you are crazy, sometimes selfish, and an attention whore; however you are also fun, and easier to get along with than when i first met you (bc everyone included you knows i couldn't stand you) and for some odd reason i have grown to love and respect you and always will (even though i hate to admit it    ewww  mushiness  yuck) "
#15 i thought you were so weird and quirky and perky when i first met you  and i met you when i was at a very emotionless point in my life  but you soften me a little and you made me smile  i think you are the sweetest free spirited person i know  and i have a feeling that we will be friends even when we get old and gray  and a whole lot of other stuff i can't really put it all my wall   but you know how i feel fool

#54 i think you are a very genuine person who is constantly searching for himself and you just want to be loved and love everyone 
#911 i feel like you are like a little brother to me (a distant little brother bc i don't ever see you anymore) bc i met you when you were in the upward bound program and i thought you were a bad little boy and now you have little babies of your own and you have grown to be such a responsible young man  awwwww     tear
"#0123 i had a big crush on you when i stayed with your brother the one yr during spring break but then you farted around me the whole wk i was there so i just figured you were trying to get me to not like you (bc what guy farts around girls they don't know that well) anyway after that you just became like a big bro to me and i always feel respected, and safe and comfortable around you  and you are a sweetheart!"
"536 such a sweet guy, pretty eyes, giving, the kind of guy a woman should settle down with when she's ready  the kind of guy a woman doesn't want to mess up with bc she's not ready    wink "

"well #2043 you were like such a high school jock and i was just socially detached and mean in high school so we never really crossed paths (socially) but i remembered you and you never had an ill word to say to me then and you are such a cool guy now i wish i had more time to <propfemale> with you bc i'm sure we'd have a blast and i will kick your a$$ in pool anytime, any place!  playful "
"#1919 such a cutie pie and a real cool guy, no lie i wouldn't have mind if we spent some quality time    no for real though     you aight"
#7 i know you love me and you mean well and you try so hard to do the right things despite what your peers are doing and you strive so hard to be a good christian and i admire and respect that about you and i love that you are saving yourself for marriage and i wish i had the courage that you have to challenge the pressures of this sex driven world  you can be so awesome bc only pc ppl are awesome anyway 
"i am off to work early this morning! i don't think i will be working both jobs today  so when the other one calls i will say heck no, be i absolutely must do something to my hair for drill this wknd  i wish i knew somebody who would braid my hair for free bc i am temporarily broke right now  (deep sigh)"

"her hair was up in a pony tail, her favorite dress tied with a bow  today was daddy's day at school, and she couldn't wait to go  but her mummy tried to tell her, that she probably should stay home  why the kids might not understand, if she went to school alone  but she was not afraid; she knew just what to say  what to tell her classmates of why he wasn't there today  but still her mother worried, for her to face this day alone  and that was why once again, she tried to keep her daughter home  but the little girl went to school eager to tell them all  about a dad she never sees  a dad who never calls  there were daddies along the wall in back, for everyone to meet  children squirming impatiently, anxious in their seats  one by one the teacher called a student from the class  to introduce their daddy, as seconds slowly passed  at last the teacher called her name, every child turned to <propfemale>e  each of them was searching, a man who wasn't there  'where's her daddy at?' she heard a boy call out  'she probably doesn't have one,' another student dared to shout  and from somewhere near the back, she heard a daddy say, 'looks like another deadbeat dad, too busy to waste his day ' the words did not offend her, as she smiled up at her mom, and looked back at her teacher, who told her to go on  and with hands behind her back, slowly she began to speak  and out from the mouth of a child, came words incredibly unique  'my daddy couldn't be here, because he lives so far away  but i know he wishes he could be, since this is such a special day  and though you cannot meet him, i wanted you to know all about my daddy, and how much he loves me so  he loved to tell me stories he taught me to ride my bike  he surprised me with pink <propfemale>s, and taught me to fly a kite  we used to share fudge sundaes, and ice cream in a cone though you cannot see him  i'm not standing here alone  'cause my daddy's always with me, even though we are apart i know because he told me, he'll forever be in my heart' with that, her little hand reached up, and lay across her chest, feeling her own heartbeat, beneath her favorite dress  and from somewhere here in the crowd of dads, her mother stood in tears  proudly watching her daughter, who was wise beyond her years! for she stood up for the love of a man not in her life, doing what was best for her, doing what was right  and when she dropped her hand back down, <propfemale>ing straight into the crowd  she finished with a voice so soft, but its message clear and loud  'i love my daddy very much, he's my shining <propfemale>  and if he could, he'd be here, but heaven's just too far  you see he is a soldier and died just this past year when a roadside bomb hit his convoy and taught us all to fear  but sometimes when i close my eyes, it's like he never went away ' and then she closed her eyes, and saw him there that day  and to her motherâ€™s amazement, she witnessed with surprise  a room full of daddies and children, all <propfemale>ting to close their eyes  who knows what they saw before them, who knows what they felt inside  perhaps for merely a second, they saw him at her side  'i know you're with me daddy,' to the silence she called out  and what happened next, made believers, of those once filled with doubt  not one in that room could e playful lain it, for each of their eyes had been closed  but there on the desk beside her, was a fragrant long-stemmed <propfemale>  and a child was blessed, if only for a moment, by the love of her shining <propfemale> and given the gift of believing, that heaven is never too far  post this to let everyone know that our soldiers will never be forgotten if you don't send it to anyone, it means you're in a hurry and that you've forgotten your friends  take the time   to live and love  until eternity  ?"
