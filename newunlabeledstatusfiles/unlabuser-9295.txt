"last night was a little rough, but the more i work, the easier things become! and yes, i do love being a nurse!!"
feeling masochistic today- watching movies that make me cry  maybe while i get ready for dinner with my friends i will put on a good comedy!
"somewhere right now, a nurse is getting yelled @ for being late with meds, holding their bladder cause they can't pee, starving cause they missed lunch, being puked on, pooped on, bled on, peed on, yelled at and is missing their family while taking care of yours  in the minute it took you to read this, nurses all over the world are saving lives  repost if you are a nurse, love a nurse, or appreciate one"

"working my tail off this weekend  but thank god for the people i work with who guide me, help me, and support me!"
i have to grow up and admit to myself that i can't have it all and do it all  i just can't afford to emotionally or financially  so    would anyone like to adopt a <propfemale> pin?
"so happy to have the next two days off! after spending my last 5 days at work, i need it!!!"

yay for date nights!
"naturally on my first day at work, i spill coffee and forget my lunch!"
"one thing i have to remember about evening shift: caffeine in moderation or else i will be up all night, annoy <propmale> by being so damned hyper, and will most likely be tired the next day   "
it's going to be a long day    but a decent one!
leaving work to spend the first night in our new apartment!!! yay!!!!
"having an ok day off    i want to cook something for <propmale> for dinner, but i just realized that we don't have knives yet     so i guess spaghetti it is!"
