"after reviewing my wall, i realized that a lot of people wished me a happy birthday without knowing what exactly i did on my birthday  on my 21st b-day (aug 4th) i spent it in afghanistain (which im still here btw) fighting a war that probubly all of you have been watching on the news during this summer sometime "
"my unit is 2 8 <propfemale> if any of you want to look up some pictures, because i am told i was caught in a couple of them (hope they got my good side  playful   ) maybe if some of you are interested, i will share the memorable story that happened on the 4th of august  im almost back in the states so hit me up anytime        "
