"\live like there is a tomorrow \"" love """
"im finding that if i just go with the flow, things will go a lot smoother    life is too short   why live trying to make everything perfect  things are the way they are and if things progress and get better    wonderful  other than that i really dont give a shit at the moment   smile "

"i love it when the weather is like this, because even though my mouth hurts from wisdom teeth, i am in a really good mood  sun and rainbows are so magical!  smile "

i figure just not thinking about it would be best but i'm finding it very hard not to think about it    
my tummy attacked me today! not good  other than that my day wasn't bad

"just watched karla    very disturbing movie but it was a good movie to watch  based on a true story about a couple that kidnapped, raped, and murdered girls  sad but i recommend watching it if you haven't, its insight to how easily some people can be deceiving, heartless, and just plain wrong "
"took some pamperin (so now my cramps are pretty much gone), ate some pizza rolls and worked out   i really need more to do    i'm bored again   waiting for <propmale> to get here   "

<propfirst> zerjav made me feel a lot better last night!  smile  i'm lucky i met him   love 
off to apply to jobs  i hate this process but it must be done 
it would be a very bad idea for me to drive with a gun in the car  (reasoning   if i did   little old black man in the pacifica wouldve be shot up!) old people shouldn't have the right to drive   unless tested and are capable of not being a complete freakin moron!
so ready for this weekend!  smile 
had a great weekend with <propfirst> zerjav!  love 
even tho i am in pain (wisdom teeth again!) i am very happy    thanks to <propfirst> zerjav!  love

"yay   i finally get to pack up so i can spend the weekend with my gorgeousness, <propfirst> zerjav! love "
it's such a bummer when you're horny and your partner is not  *thumbs down *
"i\ will be myself   no matter what  this is who i am  it fills me with joy\ that it's me that makes you happy  i am enough for you  as you are \enough for me  love "
is sad   sad 
"my goodness, i need a job so very badly "
i can't help it   i miss him 
all i want to do is sleep next to <propfirst> zerjav   but boys need their boy time  all i can hope is that he is staying out of trouble but having fun 
i don't even know how to e playful lain the amount of disappointment i feel right  i wish someone would actually give me a chance   they would be pleasantly surprised  i'm not out to hurt no one  i'm a gently authentic soul 
i'm done  i give up  i shouldn't have to work so hard to keep a relationship going  peace 
sad   even though i shouldn't be   i still am   sad 
friends are a great help  i'm so lucky to have a few that are great  good night  love 
made for better and bigger things 
"there are unfortunate events that must fall into place to make your life better  when one door closes another opens  leave the past, absorb the present, and embrace the future  life is what you make it  live it, love it, and hold on (it's a bumpy ride)   smile "
"well, i got work friday and all next week, filling in at the dry cleaner  hopefully after that i'll have a new job  maybe i'm finally gonna be able to get back to normalcy "
