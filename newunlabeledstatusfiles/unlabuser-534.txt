cant believe the schedule is made for the fall  bleh 
i can't wait to spend one day in my bed past 630 in the morning  that would be fabulous 
clinical paperwork forever & then it's tee shirt time  smile 
had a great time tonight with my girls  smile 
can't wait to get out of work & spend time with my family  smile 
people are so classy 
i've learned that making a living is not the same thing as making a life     love 
its not having what you want but wanting what you've got 
what a gorgeous morning
reluctantly setting my clock an hour ahead 
you can only become truly accomplished at something you love  donâ€™t make money your goal  instead pursue the things you love doing and then do them so well that people canâ€™t take their eyes off of you 
i want to go on vacation  sad 
finishing touches on the med-surg paper and i've decided i am going to get tj's for dinner  smile 
writing a paper twice sucks 
text me numbers  new phone 
studying with the bestiess    love 
can't wait to sleep in tomorrow  smile 
the top gets higher the more that i climb    
layed in bed all day  guess i should get ready for school now
life's like an hourglass glued to the table
