"the facebook trick: press up,up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, enter key, then right click then press up and down, then scroll the <propfemale> and magic crcles will appear  the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the <propfemale>   it will work! put this as your status if it works   weird! it definitely worked though "

"the downside of living in a building with a keypad entry is that a ups delivery man with a low iq doesn't know how to get the code from the main office to complete a delivery! then we get to find a sticker slapped on the outside door saying we were unable to accept the delivery, even though we were home! i would think the problem resides with us, if we haven't already gotten ups deliveries since we moved here "
