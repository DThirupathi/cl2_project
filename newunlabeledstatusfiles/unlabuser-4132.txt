 love  what if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared and the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
theres no one that comes close to you  cause only you can love me this way 
thinks love is for idiots!!
i wouldn't know the right path in front of me even if it had its own sign 
 sad 
"feels like i've always known u and i swear i dreamt about u all those endless nights i was alone  its like i've spent forever searching now i know that it was worth it, with u it feels like i am finally home  fallin head over heels!"
i think after the day i've had i deserve a bad massage  any takers??
after the day i've had i deserve a back massage! any takers?
wow!! mmkay  
my nose is stuffed but i can still spell b s  coming out your mouth 
<propfemale> neg a wey pri??
thx mom for bringing me down some medicine  i really needed more! three different kinds just wasnt enough haha  laugh 
its like i've seen it all before  but i can't turn around and walk out the door  walk away from everything we've been through   
the world may end one day but my love will go on forever!  love

ugh im bothered!!! my cell phone is off     and the house phone i am on now keeps beeping in my ear because its dying! seriously !
work was <propfemale> good today i got $100 for a tip  damn im good    smile  lol
" love  i pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep, but thoughts of us kept keeping me awake     smile  miss you "
"just hold me close to you, let me listen to your heart beat  love   love   love "
"sometimes i sit and i wonder and i just can't seem to believe what a blessing it's been to be loved  you're an angel sent to me, you're the <propfemale> who lights up my sky, you're the one who made me see that you don't need wings to fly  your love has set me free cause you are the one who makes me whole in my heart and in my soul and just like the sun you showed me the light i'm amazed and you're the reason why"
 love  love  love  i remember trying not to stare the night that i first met you    you had me mesmerized and three weeks later in the front porch light taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight i hadnt told u yet but i thought i loved u then   love  love  love 
i got my son a hair cut finally and now im missing his old hair that i could run my fingers through  his little tail is gone    sad  lol
i hate teenagers!!!! omg <propmale> is telling my two year old son peyton that he is going to have monsters come downstairs while he is sleeping and tear off his toes and legs and fingers and lips so in the morning they will be all gone   someone please come deal with this idiot who is standing in my room making pretend farting noises    please before i strangle him  lol
 love  love doesn't come with a contract you give me this i gave you that   it's scary business your heart and soul is on the line  why else would i be standing round here so tongue-tied for   if i knew what i was doing i'd be doing it right now my words might not be magic but they cut straight to the truth so if you need a lover and a friend   i'm in!!
my mind is flustered right now  i dont know what to do     ! one way could be great and the other could as well just with a few bumps in the road   ugh my heart is telling me one thing and my brain is telling me another i just want to break down right now    sad   this sucks!!!!
f you   f you    f you and you and you  !  laugh  hahahahahahaahahahaha
ready to ripe this damn tooth out of my head   sad  im dyin here!
you mean so much to me but im better off with out you   yet your the only one i want and the only one who means anything anymore  !
" love   love  so where do we go from here with all this fear in our eyes  and where can love take us now we've been so far down  we can still touch the sky   if we crawl til we walk again then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump then we'll fly until there is no wind  so lets crawl, crawl, crawl, back to love  love   love "
"started off the day feeling like crap, but gradually it seems to just keep getting better and better!  love "
 love  broken 
tonight is the night where i may just punch somebody just because  
i woke up early this morning around 4am with the <propfemale> shining bright as headlights on the interstate i pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep but thoughts of us kept keeping me awake ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms i've been tryin' my best to get along  
what am i suppose to do when the best part of me was always you what am i suppose to say when i'm all choked up and your ok    i'm falling to pieces  they say bad things happen for a reason but not wise words gonna stop the bleeding i'm still grieving  cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven love 
sometimes we dont learn from our mistakes sometimes weve no choice but to walk away tried to break my heart well its broke tried to <propfemale> me high well im choked wanted rain on me well im soaked soaked to the skin  its the end where i begin now im alive and my ghosts are gone ive shed all the pain ive been holding on the cure for a heart is to move along  move along what dont kill a heart only makes it stronger 
my phone sucks everytime i try to text someone i push one letter and it types a completely different letter    this might be the night me and my phone go at it! come morning time it could possibly be shattered on my floor!!!! daahhhhh!
when i step on the scene ya'll know me cause i walk a limp like an old school pimp like a real o j  im rockin vans im in the sand i got a redbull n vodka up in my hand  hey! this what i wanna do  drink all day play all night lets get it poppin bitch   i gotta plan whats ur cell we playin naked twista back in my hotel  get your hands up !!
whisper what you said one more time   i could have sworn i heard u say that u are mine  i will be the only one if u say you'll never go  i'll be screaming out your name from the back row  you will be my only one   two lovers in the night waiting for the sun to rise 
today kinda just uhhmmm really sucks !!!! whoever came up with v-day should be slapped
all i have to say is fuck you! you can lie to everyone and keep on telling your lies but im not stupid and sure as hell not blind i wish you could get hit by a bus so i would never have to hear your voice or see your face you disgust me  please go away forever   laugh 
 sad 
i know that the bridges that i've burned along the way have left me with these walls and these scars that won't go away and opening up has always been the hardest thing until you came along  so lay here beside me just hold me and don't let go this feelin' i'm feelin' is somethin' i've never known and i just can't take my eyes off you   love 
"love me without fear, trust me without wondering, love me without restrictions, want me without demand, accept me how i am "
my heart is blind but i don't care 'cuz when i'm with you everything has disappeared and every time i hold you near i never wanna let you go    love 
i use to dream about the life im living now i know theres no doubt  i made it  money be fallin' from the sky-y-y-y-y-y  see i dont live for fame just the love of the game  i look up to the sky i know the world is mine 
if i had a weapon    somebody might be hurt! my brother was suspended from school today and he is as bad if not more than my 2 yr old son  i need a drink a big big big big bigggggggggg drink!!!!!!!! please 
butt nugget!!?!?
trying to look at the brighter side of things     hmm   this is kinda difficult 
i dont think ive ever laughed this hard in a long time my stomach hurts <propfemale> bad and im crying       wow i can barely catch my breathe    hahahahahahaha i love this !!
so     this could be the beginning of an amazing thing  
i will not leave a letter   nothing at all im sure you wont even notice im even gone  why did i stay here for so long when were <propfemale> far gone  i feel so stupid for taking this fall i should have seen it   known all along   what could u possibly want from me      annoyed 
sometimes i lay under the <propfemale> and thank god i'm breathing then i pray don't take me soon cause i'm here for a reason sometimes in my tears i drown but i never let it get me down so when negativity surrounds i know some day it'll all turn around
should we say go? should we say stay? do we stand tall? or do we fade away? do we keep on? or do we fall down? i won't say goodbye i won't say that now!
"say what you mean, mean what you say! i  love  him!"
"you are the one, who makes it worth getting up in the morning  i'd trade the sun, for the <propmale> to show you i'm all in  we could be like <propfirst> and beyonce, <propfemale> and <propfirst> us like a movie, take that <propmale> on love yeah  now i can't predict what the future holds, but i'll fight forever to keep you close   love   love   love "
does anyone know where a really really really tall bridge is? i need to jump off it! uuuuggggghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i miss those blue eyes   how you kissed me at night   i miss the way we see like there's no sunrise   like the taste of your smile   i miss the way we breathe but i never told you   what i should have said   no i never told you   i just held it in and now i miss everything about you!!
so im standing in the kitchen and all the lights are off    i hear this scary noise that makes me jump and actually stop what im doing and look around me to see what it was    i walk in the the tv room and find to my surprise     my son snoring!! hahahaha scared the crap out of me  but i love him ooooh so much! now he just needs to get better fast!
today was almost a great day  smile  haaaaaaaaaaaaaa fyi <propfirst>    i'm still hyper
when i close my eyes all i see is you  every song i hear all i think of is you  it hasnt been that long and i cant stop thinking about you  i miss you
way to tired for today    can't it be over already
 love   love   love  every road that i've been down  the only truth that i have found there's only one thing i can't live without    you  i was searching for something i thought i would never find then came you  i thought i knew what the real thing was but nothing shakes me like your love does  i've been hypnotized  now i realize   love   love   love 
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars i could really use a wish right now   wish right now   wish right now  laugh 
sometimes i wonder      if i was just put on this earth to fail   if so im doin great
i wish for           
 love  i really need you tonight    our love is going to start tonight   once upon a time i was fallin in love now im only fallin apart 
i just want to screaammmmmmmmmmmmm!
"each new day i'm moving forward, i push the fear away and i let go  i'm so through with barely hanging on leaving what's in the past behind  i come closer to crossing over the line and i won't stop until i get what i've been fighting for  you've said it all before  tell me again i am strong, tell me again i won't fall, take me beyond what i can see break me, make me believe  you have made me all i need to be  love   love   love "
if u could see me yesterday who i used to be before the change u'd see a broken heart u'd see battle scars  it's funny how words can't e playful lain how good it feels to break the chains  i'm not what i have done i'm what i've overcome  i know i'll stumble i know i'll still face defeat these second chances will define me  so i'm moving forward  i'll make mistakes and i might fall but i won't break 
just gonna stand there and watch me burn   yeah that's alright cause i love the way it hurts      just gonna stand there and watch me cry   yeah that's alright cause i love the way you lie  
great birthday  being drunk is great ugly people turn pretty  it's amazing
you make me laugh!!  laugh  hahaha
moving forward  forgetting the ones that dont matter  and remembering the ones who do  my life couldnt be better right now!!!
"i'm not your lover, i'm not your friend     goodbye slc  "
"with a word, with a line\with a smile that says goodbye\baby goodbye\\it's raining now on <propmale> street \and i'd walk to you if i could trust my feet  annoyed "
"i keep on running, keep on running and nothing works  i can't get away from you, no\\i keep on ducking, keep on ducking and nothing helps  i can't stop missing you yeah\\it's like i'm his new nightmare he ain't escaping  it makes me feel a bit complete yeah\\knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya   memories, they soon delete   hmmmmmmm"
"and when i thought it couldnt get any worse   \it turned around and became great!!  smile  \\ps  kid cudi is amazing"
