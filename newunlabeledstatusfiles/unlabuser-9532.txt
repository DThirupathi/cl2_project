i'm tired of being sick  sad 
"pray for me, stand by me but don't cry for me            i just got handed a big ole box of lemons, who's got sum sugar?  wink  once the fire is not but ambers and ashes this bird will take flight           i always do, just a lil bit slower this time"
"ok so i'm sittin here thinkin how havein liam for <propfemale> was a blessin for me or i would have not known till it was to late but not everyone can and will have the same twist of fate as i did so i wanna share signs i got so u can b more aware as my family cause it can b past on but can also go unnoticed or missed,again"
"<propfemale> i learned we were havin a liam for sure i started fellin tired very easy, short of breath and <propfemale> i would simply stand up my heart would race makin me feel sick dizzy and weak, i figured it was cause i was carryin another boy which i told <propfemale> he was from the beginin cause i had felt the same way with <propfirst> but liam was worse(now i wonder if that was warnin signs of ph and not of a boy)either way i was"
"certain <propfemale> was finaly gettin that bounin baby boy  as i got bigger with liam the feelin got worse but i assumed it was due to all the extra weight, after he was born and i was back in louisiana i was up late makin my boy a cup of milk <propfemale> i blacked out and was awoken by sumone in the house, twice this happen in one night       sumthing"
"was not right  i was still feelin all the other signs but had guessed my body was simply tired from the 6 kids i have carried(don't assume about ur health)but i wanted a doctor to tell me i was ok(that and <propfemale> wouldn't shut up, lol)after many test ran by a new doctor we found the pulimenary hypertention, ph, which e playful lained all i felt, but"
"then one of the other test came back not so good, young red blood count of a normal woman my age is around 20,000, mine is sittin at 7,000, which calls for a very uncomfortable test, bone marrow removed from hip and bone itself  sad  now we r waitin to see which culprit is causin this low count and goin from there"
"                  in a way its nice to know what is goin on cause i knew i simply didn't feel nor look like me anymore, but didn't know why, <propmale> <propfemale> and liam, now with answers and treatment maybe i'll get to see me"
"prognosis: the prognosis depends on the specific disease  some cases may stop progressing or improve, particularly if the cause can be identified and treated  others may develop quickly or slowly into end-stage lung disease  the course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is very difficult to predict; however, average survival is approximately five to seven years          well that just sucks"
