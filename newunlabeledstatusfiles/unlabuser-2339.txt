finally got all the water sucked up did as much as we could  it will still take awhile until everything is cleaned up though  apparently the welders set off a fire in a circuit that then caught some stuff in the bookstore basement  storage on fire  then it took forever to find the right mane in order to shut the sprinklers off  we are so going to be here late
