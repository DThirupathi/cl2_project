"enjoying a drink in bangor, maine  i never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers to servicemembers "
"djibouti   well, it doesn't exactly suck, but it is like walking around in an oven, and my sleep schedule is jacked  on the upside, i have my bike, i will have plenty of time to go to the gym, and i will never be late for work  on the down side, they made"
"well, i didn't make chief, and i am no longer the lpo (apparently i'm arrogant, among other things), but at least i got the orders i wanted  8th & i, here i come   now i just have to get through living the next 8 months in what feels like the left armpit of the world "
"so   it rained tonight  that was wierd  i was under the impression that rain was, like, impossible in djibouti this time of year; it just never gets cool enough for the water to condense   el nino, i'm tellin ya "
"is reading the case for mars by <propfirst> zubrin  in case you've never heard of him, he's the guy who figured out how to send people to mars, on a legitimate scientific mission, not just flags and footprints, back in the late eighties and early ninties, using 1960's <propfemale> technology, for 11% the cost of the plan that was originally put forth by nasa during the same time frame  genius "
"just had a great time with my daughter at her school on her birthday  moes for dinner, then busch gardens tomorrow    when will i find time to finish my homework? ah, the trials of r&r, neither restful nor relaxing, but still good "

"fatboy slim's \weapon of choice\""    arguably the best music video ever made """

"you know what? thanksgiving loses a bit of its luster when you're getting a divorce, stuck in the left armpit of the world, and you have given up meat    and whats the deal with no pumpkin pie? it's a conspiracy, i tell ya!"
so    yeh    25 <propmale> may have been a bit much for my first time back on the bike in <propmale> in a few months  i am gonna have to invest in a case of powergels 
"tdy kicks arse    2 days in germany, long layover in london   all on the government dime  my only question is how come kid rock and <propfirst> mencia come to do a show for the troops in germany, but in djibouti we get someone's kid brother's garage band? i'm just sayin "
"does it make me a dirtbag sailor that, if they would take me, and give me guaranteed orders to bolling afb, i would switch to the air force in a heartbeat?"
"so, yeah   aparently the air force thinks that the navy equivalent to their independent duty medical technician is not an independent duty corpsman, but rather, a hemodialysis technician  right "
"i just realized, i am about to get on a plane with 4point leather restrains in my luggage  in germany  this could be interesting "
"oh yeah, and 7 months worth of nuvaring    ha!"

so   back in djibouti  say hello to dysthymia 
"if you are annoyed by the fact that it has been 40 years since we made the space travel equivalent of going to the corner 7-11, and stopped doing even that less than 10 years later   sign the petition found here    www humanstomars org"
<propfemale> christmas (although it should be in september)  i miss you all  at least i don't have to deal with sickies today 
"delaying finishing my homework    odd, i love being in school, but i hate doing the homework "

"3 6175; not good enough to graduate with honors, but then again, neither was my level of effort  it will suffice for just about any masters program in the country, though "
"three and a half years ago, i couldn't even spell graduwat, now i are one   "
"wow, and here i thought no one liked me  wait a sec   how many of you do i still owe money too?"
"i don't post much   but this is important:  contact your congressperson at (202) 225-3121, and ask them to vote no on hr 5781, set to be debated on the floor tomorrow  this <propmale> would authorize nasa to spend 5x as much money transporting astronauts onboard russian spacecraft as they would spend developing domestic commercial spaceflight capabilities  if you feel strongly about this, spread the word  thanks!"
so     sleeeeeeeepy  33 days left 
"for all of my friends who don't know   i am in the middle of the process of becoming a very different kind of sailor  please don't get offended if i don't have the time to say much to you at the moment   i barely have time to handle the small stuff right now, like dishes and laundry "
