being happy doesn't maen that everything is perfect  it means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections 
"we tend to forget that happiness doesn't come from getting something we don't have, but rather recognizing and appreciating what we do have"
â€œlove is the condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own â€�
good humor makes all things tolerable
hardships make us strong  problems give birth to wisdom  sorrows cultivate compassion  those who have suffered the most will become the happiest 
you are free to choose what to do in your life  you aren't free to alter the consequences 
"the measure of a person is not how well they prepare for things to go right, but how gracefully they stand and move on when it all goes wrong"
thanks guys
laugh as much as you breathe and love for as long as you live
