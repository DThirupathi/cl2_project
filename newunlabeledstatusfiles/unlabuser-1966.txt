"this a m , 1 1 2 weeks after my respiratory flu retreated into a cold, woke up with congestion & whopper of a headache again   went to work for an hour or so, left because my head was pounding too much to think   tylenol & sinus spray have minimized it to a dull but insistent roar   the same bug staging a surprise uprising?  or battle cry of a brand new virus?  back to large doses of echinacea, vitamin c, zinc   "
"recorded a wheels to work psa for wfhb this evening   ate, ordered some christmas gifts online (thanks to my amazon prime subscription, most will actually arrive by the end of the week!)  now ready to take some more tylenol and collapse "

"back to work tomorrow, so ready to head for bed now     after completely neglecting nearly all of my goals for winter vacation, i finally accomplished some tasks today, so feeling good, despite the fact that the alarm is going to ring awfully early tomorrow "
"the dilemma was between dragging my bone-weary body into the kitchen to make marinara sauce for the fresh pasta in the freezer   or dragging my bone-cold body back out into the gloomy last gasp (hopefully) of winter for pizza   i'm about to call pizza x and commit   i need a personal chef, but <propfemale>'s in nc & <propfirst>'s away for the weekend, and they're the only ones i can afford "
"i tried to convince the guys at pizza x that eller rd  isn't far past their airport rd  delivery boundary, so they could extend their route to bring me pizza, but it was a no go   they said that i didn't want delivery anyhow, because then i wouldn't get to see them & be harassed   mmm   maybe some truth there "
"what's on my mind?  these past couple of hours chatting with my very dear, long-time friend <propfemale> (aka briney storm)  such an enlightening and healing conversation, with sparks of joy lighting up those <propfirst> corners where fear and sorrow lurk   what better way to spend time than supporting and being supported by a beloved friend, creating exciting plans for future endeavors together?"
"two hours of negotiation time left until government shutdown   still not sure if our agency would be affected   but we will be affected by the budget cuts, and the people we serve will suffer   and this wouldn't be happening if republicans hadn't insisted on tax cuts for the wealthy 3 months ago - the $ the government won't be receiving from the wealthy would more than cover the amount republicans want to cut   grrr "
"oops - two hours and 49 minutes   and it looks like they are close to reaching a compromise   but not in time to get it on paper before midnight   so a short-term continuing resolution will need to be agreed upon, as well "
"looks like legislators have come to an agreement, and just passed another continuing resolution to give them time to formally enact it   so i guess the fight is over    until fall   now we get to see just how big csbg cuts are going to be, and what that's going to mean for the agency and our clients "

"traded in our old modem, etc  (circa 2004 or earlier) for new equipment, and our internet is not only back up, but much faster!  what a relief!  i'm amazed at how dependent i've become on the internet   just a couple of days away caused a lot of stress   a far different world than i lived in just 15 or 20 years ago "
"june 16th - one of the very best days of my life: the day <propfemale> was born   love, love, love to my brilliant, talented, quirky, caring - and beautiful - daughter "

"your daughter will hold your hand for only a little while, but will hold your heart for a lifetime  it's daughters week    if you have a daughter who makes your life worth living by just being around her, and love her as much as your own breath & if you're proud of your daughter, copy and paste this to your status!"
