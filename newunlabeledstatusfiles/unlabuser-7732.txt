finally got ahold of the orthopedic doctor  soonest they can get me in is 1pm on monday  and i have to stay off it till they see it   so much for my triumphant comeback this weekend  sad  took off the splint briefly and oh my it looks terrible  sad 
having this broken ankle is giving me one bad case of cabin fever! grrr this is really lame  i'm going mad!
misses everybody   
"has to undergo surgery on the ankle now   sad  apparently the bone segment i broke has shifted so its now out of alignment  they have to open up my foot, reset the bone segment, and put 2 pins in it, then drill 2 other holes in my bone and tie it all together with metal wire  w t f  sad  surgery is wednesday at 10 am *sigh*"
it was good to get out and go to my softball game tonight  didn't play obviously but just getting out there and socializing and joking with my teammates gave me a nice morale boost  and epic win by the way  way to go <propmale> for getting the walk off hit using my bat! pics uploaded soon  now to prepare for surgery on wednesday     
in the hospital waiting to be carted into surgery  oy what a day  will let u all know how it goes 
is recovering  surgery went well  they got it back where its supposed to be and got it pinned into the main part of my fibula and wired all together  they had to keep me in recovery longer than normal because it was taking a good chunk of time to get my pain under control  but the guy taking care of me is a big mariners fan so i was groggily having a good talk with him  your support means more than u know  smile  thanks  
today is proving to be a hard day pain wise   the big 4 inch incision is really stinging today  also really bummed i'm missing celebration 5  missing out on seeing some of you i haven't seen in 5 years  sad  missing out on a lot of things lately it seems   
the heat is making me sweat which causes my surgical incision to sting like hell!!!  sad  i need a hug
not doing well today  nauseus all day and they redressed my ankle at the hospital so it's really sore  sadly can't make it to watch my softball team tonight  sad  good luck team 12!
