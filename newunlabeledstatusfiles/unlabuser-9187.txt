the hardest thing to be confronted with is the realization that the person you fell in love with is not the person your heart had made them up to be 
i feel like a <propfirst> wet turd 
"so, <propfirst> took up the whole bed, and most of the pillow    stole the blanket so i have enough to cover up one of my arms   and then he slowly pushed me up against the wall "
annoyed  that is all    
about to get a tattoo behind muh ear 
i have a shitty time falling asleep without you   
"you're my world, the shelter from the rain  you're the pills that take away my pain  you're the light that helps me find my way  you're the words when i have nothing to say, & in this world where nothing else is true, here i am still tangled up in you  i'm still tangled up in you "
"my dad just told me : \everything looks like a wiener to a wiener lover \"" lmao"""
