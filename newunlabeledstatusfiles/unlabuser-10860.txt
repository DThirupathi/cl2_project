"i looked over at the pale <propfemale>, my eyes wandered for a while when they set down on the clear pool of water  my reflection showed the side of me i wanted to hide  the souless eyes which scared the bravest of men, the stare that could freeze hell in an instant and the invisible scars of wounds from the past  i walked past the place i called home or so i thought "
darling will you please ( please ) take a walk with me     we could count the stars and disappear (i wish you could see) i wish you could see    you're the only girl i've ever dreamed of   
"i'm in pain but i'll live  just sprained my ankle nothin 2 bad but just in case i'm am a o    ow k  ~i no longer fear the sky, no longer believe i will fall, no longer fear my wings  i will spread them and  fly, fly to a place no one will know, a place where i will be safe~"

"among the darkest corridors remains a glimmer, a small light which those of us cling to  a light which all can see  a light we call hope  if we all see it, i must be blind   since the darkness has enveloped my consciousness and covered my eyes for all i see is the shadows of my fears, the dark flames which spread turning all hope to ash "
"if i lose control  who will stop me? if my hands reach out  will anyone be there to take them? if my mask breaks  who will care? if i break the walls around me  will anyone be there? honestly, i think no one "
my ankle is pissing me off  i've missed enough classes!!! grrrr i hate my bad luck
random toothaches suck - -;;
as a phoenix i will rise from the ashes and reclaim my rightful place  where i belong 
its about time we get together  no? we need to in order to see change come forth  so let's do this we need to work together!
time to think is time to figure out if i should strike or hold back 
i is dah tank!!!!
i can never claim my <propmale>  i can never reach out  i can never scream out in defiance  as of now i can only sit by and watch over those who i care about the most  who are they  how bout you tell me?
