"if i collected all the pennies i've seen on the crosswalks up until now in berkeley   i'd probably have a dollar \   then there were the ring of keys, the <propmale> ticket, the calid, and the credit card   it's amazing what u can find at berkeley   should u just look at the ground  playful "
= = even on the 8th floor we can hear the people partying loud n clear   i want my sleep~~~ which is y i've gotten into the habit of listening to my mp3 at night   i'll probably choke myself one day
"   why is it that coming to berkeley i'm suddenly seeing a whole bunch of people who look like a bunch of other people?\i saw a girl who looks like my counselor <propfemale> emmert\i saw a guy who looks looks like detective callahan from rookie blue\and i saw another guy who looks like the boyfriend of my roommate\   such a strange world cal is   "
these last two weeks i feel like i spend most of my time reading   my head hurts  playful 
i'm so lucky i can go back home whenever i want   i've probably made over 5 (long) lists so far for things that i found out i need or that would be really helpful to have

i wish time would just stop and give me a day to collect myself and catch up to everything before it continued to tick away the seconds   too bad reality is a b*tch 
"   shouldn't have sworn   it's not reality's fault it doesn't work that way   \\(   going into repenting mode  troubled )"
