well    sunday <propfirst> will go vote on contract   will they accept or will we all have no jobs?!?!  it has to be excepted by all five bargining units (unions)  will be glad when we know what's going to happen  the stress of the unknown is a killer     
well the vote is in  the rejected the proposal 700 to 300  looks like there moving to mississippi   oh boy    life is about to get really interesting 
the good news is we wont be moving to mississippi  the bad news is it's because the company isnt transfering anyone  only the jobs are moving to mississippi  as far as we know the move will start sometime in mid 2012  the employee's will be offered nothing      so we will still be here in il  just looking for employment
