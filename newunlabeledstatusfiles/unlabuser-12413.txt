"finally made my first flash game   it's crappy, but i finally figured out buttons   it only took me an hour or so \\and i'd like to add     boole taught me nothing!"
"some people are just jerks   i don't mind if people go and hate me for whatever reason   i deal with it, it's not too bad   removing all ties between two people?  so be it   but taking a private matter public?  that's too far   i will not stand for it   i wish he could read this, because it would warn him that his life is ruined "

"i'm warning the rest of you now   never send me a message that is shared with more than 5-10 people   i'm sick of getting text messages every 5 seconds, and i'm not taking my notifications off, because it's the only way some people can reach me   next time someone does it, i will personally kick your face in "
"it's amazing what an hour of sleep can do, when you didn't sleep at all the night before "
"i forgot to say this earlier, but happy pi day!"
"so     i think i found a way to connect my psp to online adhoc play, without a ps3   i just need someone else that knows it works, and a game to test it with   "
