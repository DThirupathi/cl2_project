"i followed a mini <propfirst> out of <propfirst> today with a plate that read \wheeee\"" all the way across      with a tractor sticker next to it  made my day  smile """
"thinks she didn't party enough last night, cuz she got up just fine this morning "
now understands why letters from the bank sometimes show up all wrinkley 
is hoping     hoping to find hope
\it's hard to believe\,256f1ac269fd4f4fa267ff85c8e92be2,"that do chipmunks, hypnotists, and sand volleyball all have in common?"
tears were shed but laughs brought me back
"*beep beep beep* \why is the fire alarm going off?\"" *beep beep beep* \""who burnt the popcorn this time?!?\"""""

found out that eyes have trees the other day   lucy prisco
"so much homework, so little time\   thanks for keeping me alive <propfemale> rushton and <propfemale> prisco!!!"
wishes that someone just knew the pain    
"in my few years on this luminous orb, life has swallowed me whole and spit me back out  i tell tales that stretch one's imagination to their wildest dreams  i come with scars from my past and look with both caution and excitement towards the future  my wounds have blistered and now form a new shape on my imperfectness, and yet i see others and realize that they too have disfigurements "
"put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice  people who are gay are not looking for a cure but acceptance and equal rights  will you make it your status for a least one hour?    promote love & acceptance, not hate "
can't wait for my weekend to start!
should prolly start trying to figure stuff out on her own   but still loves the late nights with <propfemale> prisco  smile 
"\today has been a crappy week\"" <propfemale> prisco  haha  love  u!"""

could really use a good hug right about now  sad 
loves <propfemale> litchfield even though i dont have her as a friend  sad 
you know someone's crazy when they're saying thank you to a printer   lucy prisco  but love it!  love 
"stuck in this place with no way out, tryin' to survive one day at a time "
"i have this strange feeling spreading through my entire back  i look into the mirror and what do i see? why, of course, a knife sticking out between my shoulder blades!"
school during break=silence   heater   silence   heater   silence   singing?!?
waiting   but slowly washing away
sometimes   i don't like time  its like a knife being thrown at my head and i have to react in a split-second 
   never thought id ever feel like this
has to keep telling herself that she can make it through this week  rip  love 
mine has a few worn-out patches and a couple of holes   and it's red!
being shred to pieces as if it didn't matter  being drowned as if no one cared  being left behind as if i weren't real 
about to be devoured by a monster and no one even notices that it is approaching
"but with each step further into the great unknown,\the hope begins to fade and i am left with nothing \i am now completely numb\and my thoughts of turning back have multiplied \i cannot prevent this feeling of sadness\nor can i get rid of it \i feel that complete silence is the only way out,\complete loss seems my only escape in this world "
walking pneumonia   bronchitis   anemia   flu   can i just put you all in a hat and pull one out so i know what you are and get rid of you?
