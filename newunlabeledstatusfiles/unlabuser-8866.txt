a dustland <propfemale> tale beginning
never underestimate the feeling of emotions  false hopes of feeling  like the unpredictable falling of rain they sneak up on you trapping you in a web of unanswerd questions  a split second of silence and your lost in the sea of souls in a black world with black love
oh yea ppla its snowin huge facebook snowball fight!! yayayayayay!!!
drowning in a abyss of emotions when will it stop let me face the fact of reality  now i spiral in my own self pity  a dying fact i live in a world with no sense of compassion  a lost soul in a darkening world unknowing the fear of reality slowly crawling into light it holds me  there i sit there i wait siting in a pool of love with the sent of blood  the saying goes love hurts  but theirs so much more to be said 
weird toiletts               it goes down the hole and never comes back!!!!         ever           happy new year

once it was yellow then i looked up and the never ending horizon was red reaching for the far edges of the earth  never ending she said  never wanting it to end it will spread until every one sees the truth  that u and i are the same no matter what they say i love you and that was the truth the love in the soul that will never die   :rain:
now ur lil sun rises to ur red blue sky  loosing alll self controll  it will slowly die  now purple yellow <propfemale> fall to the earth below such a beautifull <propfemale> to bestow  now look at your dyeing child and kiss the soul now slipping inbetween ur hands  some day we'll all have to learn to let go  just hope we all dont go to the world below :rain:
