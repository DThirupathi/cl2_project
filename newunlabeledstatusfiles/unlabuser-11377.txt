he told me that my curfew was an hour earlier and was yelling and throwing a tantrum  my grandma (who is sick from stress) came out of her room because of the commotion and started yelling at my grandpa  she had just told him earlier to leave my cousin and i alone and he only listened for a couple of hours before this rampage 
"my grandpa wouldn't calm down and my grandma une playful ectedly slapped him in the face  my grandpa got even more crazy and grabbed my grandma by the arms and started to shake her, which caused my cousin and i to get angry and yell at him to stop  my cousin got up and helped my grandma to the room  "
