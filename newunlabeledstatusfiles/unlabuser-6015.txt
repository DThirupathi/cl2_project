had an amazing easter weekend and hopes that the rest of the week follows suit   and people should check out red halo if you haven't heard them yet   very decent band
kinda curious   little aggravated   still very hopeful though   ah the power of optimism
has seen a preview and is  ready for the next chapter to unfold itself  love  anyone wants to <propfemale> out give me a shout and smile   it confuses people
is blissfully oblivious to everything around her because she is entirely too happy for her own good   i absolutely love my life at this moment  love   love   love 
waiting to find out about something tonight   love to everyone 
we set her head on fire   along with half the yard ::walks away whistling::
wonders where the melted head disappeared to   we never found it 
has a fairly busy week ahead   hopefully tomorrow we will have the *crosses fingers* last kinks with the car worked out so i will be able to get everything done 
*strike that*  <propfemale> is curious and wishes to understand   but i'll deal with that later   love   love   love 
"  my great grandma died this morning, but i finally have my car   i guess with the good must come some bad"
hanging out with my awesome little brother <propmale>

"sadly, is preparing to be short one kristpoher tomorrow as he goes to drill   sad weekend for the <propfemale>"

"mkay, i've seen a few people do this so i might as well:  completely\ honest for the next 24 hours, you canask me one question (only in \my inbox)   any question , no matter how crazy  i will answer no \matter what   you have my full honesty ,but i dare you to put this \as your status & see what questions you get asked"
ho hum   
wonders what tomorrow will bring in this crazy mixed up world
"hmm   should i?  no, i shouldn't    or maybe i will!   no    no i won't   but i must!!   no! i cant!!   but i wanna!!  i will one day    maybe sooner than you think     lol!"
thinks that maybe now would be a good time to    go outside
  you remind me of the babe 
loves my friends for being able to complete what i had as my status  smile 
wonders what makes people do the things they do sometimes   
<propfirst> bowie -  god among men? or alien among gods?
"every generation needs a new revolution \\-<propfirst> <propmale>"
"don't refuse to go on an occasional wild goose <propmale> - that's what wild \geese are for "

is about to literally die of boredom   someone help   lol
dancing in the rain sounds fun right now    all i need is some rain 
 love  just remember: any time someone tells you to *believe* them for no reason   there is a lie in the middle of it   (haha   got to love puns that are actually ironically true)  love

"really shouldnt play all these damn apps, but they amuse me in late hours when i can't sleep so oh well"

"you know exactly where im coming from when i say \you know that thing   over there in the drawer   er   cabinet   the umm that  ugh you know what i mean!\"""""

faith leads blindly    do you fall into step?  or do you guide others to this faith?  or do you stand alone?
"and at this point   i'm kinda in shock, but it's all good   no drama tonight lol  love   love "
"is looking at old pictures and being sentimental   maybe i'll put them up later, but maybe not, there are a few people i know that do not want old pictures of themselves seen lol"

"is putting this up so i don't have to repeat it several times:  i lost the baby monday evening, had a dnc surgery thursday, and my grandmother passed away around 6 in the a m  this morning so please keep my family in your thoughts   thank you guys i love you all "
thank you everyone for your prayers and thoughts   they are much needed *hugs*

"\ i'm singing in the rain  -whap-   just singing in the rain -whap-   what a wonderful feeling   i'm happy again\""  *giggle*  love this movie to pieces"""
*deep breath*  one day at a time    stepping blindly into faith and trust    searching for peace 
"one day the world will stop spinning, my friend   and then, you will see   oh how you will see the changes that could have and should have been made if not for human greed "
"children\ with special needs do not have an illness    it is not contagious  they\ only want what we all want: to be accepted  can i make a request of \anyone who is willing to post this and leave it on your status for at \least an hour in honor of special education week "
i welcome sleep   should it so choose to find me again sometime   
"describe me in one word, using the third letter of you're name  this is fun  answer me and then copy as your status and see what people say about you   "
two words   who dat (oh yes i had to do it lol)
"  found an old picture today that made me reminiscent     never say things out of anger, and always be ready to forgive someone you were once close to   your best friend today, could very well be an enemy tomorrow   everyone deserves a second <propmale>   faith is love, and forgiveness is a beautiful thing  love "
broke-ed computer sucks   daltons phone= yay facebook! lol
finally able to get back on facebook    finally not as busy as i have been    so   what have i missed the past month or so? (since alot of people didnt bother to call or anything  playful )
"  is in a bit of a \what- if\"" mood at the moment    but not quite sure what of     hmmn  """
::is sad::
"wonders what tomorrow will bring, if anything at all"
okay everyone who is saying where they like it for no good reason on their status    we know you are a whore   stop announcing it!  laugh 
babushka?     babushka!
cest la vie
sometimes   i really wonder why    lol
"this\ week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but \never met, or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that\ came home but didn't stay  make this your status if you \or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby  the majority wont do \it, because unlike cancer, baby loss       is still a taboo       \subject  break the silence   in memory of all lost angels     love "
  it's definitely time to cause a bit of trouble around these parts      or other parts   anywhere really   just for amusement
time is short and life is shorter    never have any regrets!  smile 
     sad 
you cant burn out if you werent ever on fire    
"memories are curious things     they can brighten your day, or they can destroy it   you can think of them on your own, or they can sneak up on you without warning      smile  anybody got a memory that affects them alot? lol"
is playing on the computers at best buy lol
mkay   i give up now
is thinking its friday and there needs to be mischief
<propfemale> is a virtue that normally i have    not today though  smile 
can't wait to find out what happens next
"and the world keeps spinning, and lives keep depleting, and still there is no way to stop it, because you don't see it happening   you only see it when it's done   wake up    love "
trying to help someone only works if they are willing to accept the help   and otherwise you can only watch them crash and burn   sad 
"feels a touch abandoned   by more than one person   it's kind of depressing but at the same time, i know they will turn around, and they just might be surprised to find me not waiting behind them anymore "
seriously wishes she could actually fall asleep   doesnt seem to be in the cards just yet though  sad 
"tomorrow is just like today   the problems remain and the amusements are the same, only the name changes "
we are better than this   we are more than this world can offer us    love   love 
"*giggle* is it bad that i'm a little entranced by this \new profile\""??  i think i has a new toy for a few hours  joyful """
