"my <propfirst> is acting up again    i thought i had fixed it (replaced a sensor), but apparently not! does anyone know about getting air out of the coolant system (might not be it, but worth a shot)"
k    i went to the part store and had them read the codes for my <propfirst>    p0128 the coolant temperature sensor    this is the sensor i just replaced and its not a faulty part    sooooo now    i probably am either looking at the intake manifold or a head gasket!!! ughhh   unless anyone else has any brilliant ideas of what it could be

"i really need this nice weather to hold out a little while    i just got a new pair of running  shoes and joking would really do my mind some good! plus, if it doesnt stay nice enough to jog, then i might just get frustrated enough to teach myself and elysia how to replace an intake manifold gasket (which could go horribly wrong lol)"
"i swear lol    i got a half mile into my jog, and my brother calls to inform me that he signed me up to be his assistant coach on elysia's tball team, and that i have to be at a coaches meeting tonight at 7  seriously?? thanks <propfirst>!!"

"okay sooo    just got back from the surgeons office    it is definitely another cyst, however it is slightly smaller than the last ones  he wants to avoid surgery as much as possible because if he does have to do surgery again then this time it would mean a hysterectomy  sooo    they are going to try to treat it with hormones for now and see how that goes "
blueberry raspberry  wink 
is dying
heading back to the doctor in the morning    ugh
"back from the doctors    good news is that it hasnt gotten worse, however so far, it hasn't gotten better either  still trying to avoid surgery, so i got even more meds (now im gonna have to get a bigger purse for all these pill bottles lol)  he wants me to just rest this week and just lay around, which means no work or tball coaching  ugh"
