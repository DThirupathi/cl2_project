he signed the divorce papers this morning!! did not try to make us change the custody stuff  now we just wait until the 60 day <propfirst> is up and the divorce is finalized on august 18 
it is amazing how kids will suddenly decide they like something new <propfemale> has decided that apples are great to teeth on and has gone through almost a whole bag of small ones here  they look pretty ragged when she is done chewing on them  and she also has decided she likes mandarin orange as well

ok so i give him another <propmale> since he is getting treatment for depression and alcohol  once again i think things mint have a <propmale> and once again i am so horribly wrong i should be locked up in a padded cell for my own protection 
cute little car show a block down the road we had to take a stroller ride to look at them  it was small but there were some really nice camaro's mustang's and corvette'  devlin loved looking at them he was quite a chatterbox
