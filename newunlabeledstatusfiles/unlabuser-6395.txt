"dream big, and don't ever stop \dream big, and don't ever let it go \shoot for the stars, and if you miss and hit the clouds, it's far better than shooting for the dirt and hitting every time "
i'm seriously disapointed that there wasn't a snow day 
"although i like the <propmale> potter series, one thing always annoyed me: a redneck would have solved all their problems years ago "
"<propmale> and i discovered the auto-recorded videos of the youth group playing reach, and some of our firefights  <propfirst>, your memory is slowly being taken up with awesome screenshots that you weren't present for!!!"
happy thanksgiving y'all!
"i feel sick   but the best thermometer i can find is the one for the turkey, and i really don't want that used on me "
"hm   now either the xbox isn't sending video, or the tv isn't receiving it  great "
"more snow!   and of course almost everyone is out of town, i don't have a car i trust to drive in it, and my mom gave most of our sleds away "
"on the bright side, i found out why <propfirst>'s xbox wasn't transferring video: the stupid cable flicked itself to hd again "
"stupid cat knocked my laptop off my desk, and now the disc drive won't open  great "
"you're the fighter you've got the fire\the spirit of a warrior, the champion's heart\you fight for your life because the fighter never quits\you make the most of the hand you're dealt\because the quitter never wins"
"i have a problem with persuasive speeches: i'm usually right, and i know it, and whether or not they want to admit it a lot of other people know it  it's hard to find something to persuade people of when they're already persuaded "

"happy b-day jesus! <propfemale> christmas, everyone else!"
"take up the sword of truth, and stand against the lies of the world!"
"it didn't seem like it was going to be that hard to go without tv for a week until i realized that there seem to be dvd racks everywhere i go, i unconsciously watched the weather this morning, and my favorite shows had facebook updates   now it seems like torture "
"finally started learning to play electric base! oh yeah, i'm awesome!"
gu was awesome!!! i got sick and it was still incredible!
"yes! got my history paper done and turned in on time (actually, turned in an hour early) and still got to <propfemale> out with <propfirst> for a bit, go to the basketball game (mercadez cossairt did awesome!), and get 7 hours of sleep! \who's the mann? i'm the mann!"
"first day i get to sleep in for at least a week, i stayed up late, and how far do i make it? 9 surprise 0 a m  there was a time i thought that was early   "
"suddenly i don't care so much about being single on valtine's day, because there is a lot more to love than a girlfriend  i love my friends and family  more importantly, god loves us all  how does it go? \for god so loved the world   \"" jesus is my <propfirst> """

"come on, please let biology and history be cancelled tomorrow!"
"crap  just realized i have a huge lab report and a history paper due monday, and i haven't even started on either of them  this could get interesting "
"just slightly electrocuted myself   nothing bad, only an instant blister  good thing i absorb electricity so well \considering that that happened while i was trying to fix my laptop power cord, this might be the last time i'm on facebook for a while  bye y'all!"
getting a new power cord happened much faster than i had suspected 
and now dead week begins   two weeks to spring break  i wish it was already here 
"finally finished my writing paper   just in time to get more bio homework  i love the last week of term \not "

"1 more assignment, a couple finals, and i'm done  thank god!"
three finals today   but then no school for a week and a half  i can't wait!
"my finals are complete! freedom at last!\\i wonder if this is something akin to what you'd feel after breaking out of jail, or the zoo "
"had an 8 hour work day out at kcc moving parts of the labs to one of the new buildings  nothing like realizing that you are standing in a room full of bottles marked flammable, corrosive, poisonous, deadly, or occaisionally just with a skull to keep you on your toes "
put in 28 hours of work this week! i like it 
"well, school's about to start again  are you ready? i'm ready!"
wow   basically nothing worked out as planned today  except getting school books 
"the adapter piece of my power cord vanished at some point today  i really hope i find the stupid thing, otherwise my homework is going to be a little hard to do "
