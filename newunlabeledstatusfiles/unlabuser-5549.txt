i just got back and i am 1cm dilated and 50% effaced  i am scheduled to go in monday morning at 7am our time for induction  the doctor is going to do an ultrasound before hand though because he thinks that she may be breach right now  if she is still in the same position on monday they will try to turn her and if that doesn't work they will do a c-section  so wish me luck everyone looks like i'm ganna need it
<propfirst> arrived at 12:57 pm  she is 8lbs 7 oz and 20 1 2 inches long  i had to have a c-section because she was breech and i'm in a lot of pain but doing well  her blood type is o+ and she has a lot of dark brown hair already  pictures soon to follow  thank you all for the support
