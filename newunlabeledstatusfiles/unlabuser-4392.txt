just making this facebook because everyone keeps saying that they can't find me on here  smile ~
my oldest daughter is not feeling well  sad 
"i really need to get to bed, but i probably won't for another 2 hours ***yawn***"
"wondering who's going to win \america's got talent\"""""
"today's hubby's birthday, so we had quesadillas  smile  sorry to the few of you that i know this will cause disappointment to "
it's definitely getting colder  38 degrees when i got up & closed all the windows this morning  smile ~
"the boys are with friends, hubby's at work so it's just the girls chillin' at home  smile "
"if i don't get sleep soon, i'm gonna snap!"
how much can one person handle? i think god has way too much confidence in me!
still waiting to find out what's going to happen                       
"so bored waiting for hubby to finish fixing his computer, so he'll go to bed with me 'cause it's cold & i wanna snuggle "
a decision has been made  now to ride the rollercoaster of emotions  these are the times i know that god holds me so that i can continue to move forward 
"god <propmale> me the serenity to accept the things i can not change, the courage to change the things i can & the wisdom to know the difference  and the strength of faith to step back & trust you when i feel like giving up "
i hope this is just allergies because i have too much to do to get sick!
"my heart is hurting so much, but i have done all that i know how to do  i give it all to god!"
stuck between a rock & a hard place & both are trying to close in on me 
onto the next chapter in this saga we call life 
took the next step & again we wait   
heading in a different direction & not sure how that is going to go 
"i am amazed that no matter what you do, some people would rather fight for the enemy than for the one person who has always been there for them!"
just going to keep praying & allow god to guide my heart  i can not do this alone 
actually did some christmas shopping yesterday  smile  the older kids are the hardest to buy for!
"in all of her life, i have never lied to her, yet i am the one she doesn't believe "
wishing everyone a wonderful thanksgiving!!!
now to focus on my favorite holiday    christmas!!!
"â€œwhen you have come to the edge of all light that you know and are about to drop off into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing one of two things will happen: there will be something solid to stand on or you will be taught to flyâ€�"
i believe the worst pain in a mother's life is watching her child hurt & be unable to stop the pain 
"my greatest hope is that when my children are grown, i can proudly say \these are my children\"" & they will proudly say \""this is my mom\"" """
"so many thoughts, so many emotions, too many things that can go wrong  please lord, guide me in your ways, so that all i do gives the <propfemale> to you!"
it's a beautiful snowy day  hope that it returns next friday for a beautiful white christmas!
so happy that hubby made it safely to work! it took 7 &1 2 hours to make a 35 minute drive because of snow & shut down roads 
"wishing everyone a very <propfemale> christmas filled with love, laughter & a true joy for this season  god bless each & everyone of you! {{{{{hugs}}}}}"
"â€œwhen you have come to the edge of all light that you know and are about to drop off into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing one of two things will happen: there will be something solid to stand on or you will be taught to flyâ€�"
