"going fishing today, hoping to hook into some trout or salmon with <propfirst>  smile  wish us luck!"
no luck fishing yesterday but i hope today works out  i also hope our spot isn't being over run but a bunch of loud mouth idiots that can't keep a spot secret  grrrr 
blahhhh   yep that's all that's on my mind 
"you can also feed people in need, give books to people, save the rainforest, give free mammograms to patients with breast cancer, and give health care to children in need all for free  you can click each once a day and make a difference  smile "
"i have been seeing a lot of shooting stars this year, i thought they were rare but i have seen at least 20+ in the past year  shooting stars are planets dying so, i hope it's not a bad sign   "
"you know, thank god for pets because you know they will always be your friend, never backstab you, always be there for you, and will always show appreciation for having you in their lives   "
i have an interview today for being a line therapist for autistic children!!! wish me luck!  smile 
"i might be coming down with something, i sure hope i don't since i start work in 2 days   sprite and reese's peanut butter cups will do the trick though  smile "
"my back and neck hurt really bad today, i think it's the high pressure system we've been having lately   "
"the 3 month old we babysat today was a nightmare! she screamed bloody murder for 8 hours straight, not even over exaggerating  there was absolutely nothing you could do to make that baby happy  tonight has officially made my decision that i never want kids! never ever ever ever! i still have a piercing migraine from that kid, ughh!!"
"today should be a better day, i hope "
"i got two shots yesterday and they are kicking me today, i feel like a train wreck  sad  "
so much homework lately!
"going skein fishing, then going back to work "
"have to babysit for a screaming baby all night tonight with <propfirst>  grrr this kid never shuts up, i feel like punting it sometimes "
"grrr i hate when facebook lags! which happens all the time but come on, they need to fix this crap "
i can't wait until school is over  no more school!!!
"going to the rock river today with <propfirst> and <propmale>, you never know what you're going to get out of there but we are hoping some walleyes!"
"our phone is turned back on but we have to use it sparingly  we also have unlimited texting now, however my phone isnt the best texting phone  i woke up feeling really down for some reason  i can never pin point the exact cause, i guess that's what depression does to you "
thinks there are too many clones in this world and not enough individuals 
i hate hiccups 
"babysitting again tonight, i hope the kids are on their best behavior   "
i will add more pictures later 
it's nice to know that friends that you have had for years just throw you in the dumpster like you don't mean crap to them because they are off with their fake little prissy friends getting drunk and not giving a crap about anyone but themselves  thanks for wasting my time 
"i feel like really sick  my nose wont stop running, my throat hurts, and i can barely breathe   "

"<propfirst> got me a vexilar yesterday for christmas! i'm so excited to use it out on the ice, i hope the lakes and harbors we plan on going to freeze up to be safe enough to walk on soon! thanks <propfirst>  love ! i love you!"
"last test today then i am done with this semester  i hope it goes well, i don't know the material very well though   "
"don't you just love knowing that you would be willing to do anything to help people because you would want the same in return, just to have people blow you off for their own selfish needs? people prove to me more and more everyday why i should not respect them "
"we just got back from our first ice fishing outing, we got a lot of small perch and bluegills and only 2 keeper gills, hopefully we will have better luck next time  it was fun being able to use my vexilar for the first time though  smile "
"i hate allergies!!!! i'm having a bad attack today, can't breathe, eyes are watery, nose is running like a faucet, this better be over with by christmas   "

"last night was fun, <propmale> out with some friends, played kinect adventures, kinect sports, rock band, and dance central on my friend <propfirst>'s xbox  pigged out for the last time since one of my new year resolutions is to lose some weight  i had a ridiculous sugar high last night because i apparently consumed 660 grams of sugar  so the xbox kinect really helped to lessen that energy  good times "
"it seems like everyone is starting the new year off being sick!! i am feeling a little under the weather, my brother has the flu, my mom is sick, and a bunch of people on my friend's lists are stating that they're sick  this is no good!"
"feeling pretty crappy today, just going to <propfemale> low, roll into a big blanket and watch some movies   "

"i was supposed to work this morning then i got to the location and found out i didn't   so i am confused on why my schedule said i had to work this morning  so i had to wake up extra early, shower, and rush to get ready, to find out that i don't have to work and i could of gotten more sleep but now i am awake and ready to go with nothing to do!!! gahhh! sorry, i'm frustrated   "
"my wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure but acceptance        93% of people won't copy and paste this, will you be one of the 7% that does and make this your status for at least an hour?"
"saw 2012 tonight, incredible! it was definitely well worth the money! filled with action, and a good plot  there were parts of the movie that were very unrealistic but they did a good attempt of making it scientific  but like most movies, it was hollywoodized  good stuff though!"
college started back up on sunday and it is by far the hardest semester yet  i hope i can manage to do well this semester and still have a life   ugh 
"? ? ? if you are a woman that has a wonderful man in your life that works hard and would do anything for you, then repost this    because great men are few and far between, and i appreciate and love mine ? ? ?"
"life is too short to wake up with regrets, so love the people who treat you right  forget about the ones who don't  believe everything happens for a reason  if you get a second <propmale>, grab it with both hands, if it changes your life, let it  nobody said life would be easy, they just promised it would be worth it  copy and post to your wall if you agree "
cats are awesome 
so this is a for sure thing that we have to pay monthly for facebook in july? because i think they would be making a big mistake  i think that a lot of people would leave facebook and that would result in less people wanting to advertise on their website which would result in the site losing money  why can't they just earn money from advertisements and let people network for free?
"so busy, bah "
"i love fan pages, it helps you to see that you're not the only one "
"i hate when people don't like you just because you're not like them  i also hate how people don't like you because you don't meet up to their standards like, not being happy enough  it's really pathetic "
fyi: peanut butter toast is friggin amazing 
"if your mom is your hero, whether you are blessed to have her still with you, or if she has gone to be with the lord copy and paste this with her name  <propfirst> landers"
"i hate when you have a craving for something that you don't have, i have the peanut butter but no toast  sad "
i had a dream where everyone i know was in this school and everyone was obsessed with <propfemale> sand and we were all making puppets with the <propfemale> sand and pissing off the teachers  i don't understand where dreams come from sometimes because i forgot <propfemale> sand even existed 
"watched the movie seven pounds last night with <propfirst> and <propfirst>, that movie was excellent, great story, great acting, 4 4 stars in my opinion  i recommend it to to people who like really weird movies and inspiring movies  then i watched the movie world's greatest dad with <propfirst> <propmale> in it with <propfirst> and that movie was really messed up with some funny parts, i'd probably give it 2 5 4 stars "
wishes school was so much easier   sigh 
"overwhelmed as always, i don't know why i ever post statuses when i have nothing new to say   "
sometimes i wonder why doing your best is never good enough 
"walleye fishing this week, i hope we get into them really good!"

"time for homework, blah   "
"trying our luck fishing tonight, hopefully we get some keepers!"

"finally no homework for a week, thank god for spring break! anyways, went to <propfirst>'s family get-together today and it was fun, the food was great also!"
some people are really freaking weird   yet i am too so it's cool  laugh 
"going fishing today, tomorrow the zoo, and then back to school  at least i had a fun vacation!"
"coming back from fishing, caught a legal walleye, some whitebass, and some short walleyes  it was a good time! then meeting a group of friends at the zoo tomorrow  have not been to the zoo in a while so i am excited!  smile "
"some people really do not deserve anything in life, yet they are handed everything and somehow people respect them   this does not make any sense to me  hardworking people have trouble getting anywhere in life, and then there are people who are lazy, useless, ignorant, selfish, braindead, and backstabbing and they are handed everything in life   why?!?!"
mmmm warm chocolate chip cookies are the best!
"life is too short to wake up with regrets  so love the people who treat you right  pray for the ones who don't  believe everything happens for a reason  if you get a second <propmale>, grab it with both hands  if it changes your life, let it  nobody said life would be easy, they just promised it would be worth it  post to your wall if you agree "
"work was cancelled this morning so i am probably just going to watch a movie, nap, then go meet a new client for work  i'm super stuffed up to the point where i can't breathe and my ears keep popping  hopefully i will feel better later   "

"in about a half hour i'm going shopping with my birthday money, then going to the <propfemale> garden, then going to see hot tub time machine  then tomorrow is back to reality, blah "
"name the song excerpt: so prepare for a <propmale> of a lifetime, be prepared for sensational news, a shining new <propfemale>, is tiptoeing nearer, but where do we feature, just listen to teacher, i know it sounds sordid, but you'll be rewarded, when at last i am given my dues, and injustice deliciously squared, be prepared!"
"my birthday was fun, it felt nice not having to worry about anything  now back to reality where i have to do projects for school and other homework   "
"just finished a huge essay that is due tomorrow so i don't have to worry about it anymore, now i will be going fishing today with <propfirst>, we are hoping to get enough for a fish fry, it is beautiful out so today should be a great day!"
"not sure what is going on today, maybe fishing, and if not then we will probably get some dinner, see a movie, and do the rest of my birthday shopping "

"this government irritates me, everyone that tries to live their life without getting benefits gets screwed in the end and i'm sick of it  why should some people get to go to college for free and get everything handed to them but others have to struggle just to make it  then jobs don't make it any easier when they require you to have a degree in order to actually make enough money to afford college  grrr!"
"if you have a wonderful man, who works hard to take care of you, would do anything for you, who makes you laugh, is your best friend, who wants to grow old with you, will always pick you up when you're down, who is your world & someone that you're thankful for, then    post this to your    status & give the good men recognition   i love you <propfirst>  love "

"<propfirst>, <propfirst> and i are trying our luck tomorrow for pike and panfish  we are hoping the fish decide to bite so we can take home some for the frying pan! hope it's not too cold tomorrow!!!"
"just blah, not sure how i am feeling today, there's a lot on my mind, and i am dealing with a lot of stress  i just hope everything works out positively "
"not sure what's happening today, probably just going to relax and watch the netflix movies that are coming in the mail "
too much ice cream   it hurts so good   
"maybe going to go check out the new music go round in greenfield today and bum around some other stores  sucks that everything closes early on sunday  it's been made so kids can't even say the pledge in school, yet all business close early because of evening mass? doesn't make sense to me "
"icky weather, i hate driving in snow, good thing i don't have to work today  i hope tomorrow isn't crappy out, i have a bunch of errands to run and i really rather not have to do them with snowy roads "
celebrating <propfirst>'s birthday today by going with him to <propfirst>'s old town for some ribs and to see the tourist  it is going to be a very fun night!
maybe fishing in the morning then going to watch the packers as they kick the bears asses! go packers!
it's funny how majority of adults still act like children  people will never grow up 
"not looking forward to all this snow we're getting  maybe i can get out of work but that doesn't mean no work at all for me, i still will get strangled by all the home work  that's the only disadvantage of having online classes "
"snow day for me, no work! still have school to do but it's better than shoveling!"
"doesn't make much sense, does it?? homeless go without eating  elderly go without needed medicines  mentally ill go without treatment  troops go without proper equipment  veterans go without benefits that were promised  yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first  1% will re-post and 99% won't  have the guts to re-post this "
"i'm getting sick, this sucks "
sleepy   my thursdays and fridays are so hectic   
"if i have curves, i'm fat  if i wear makeup, i'm fake  if i like to get dressed up, i'm a hoochie  if i say what i think, i'm a bitch  if i cry sometimes, i'm a drama <propfemale>  if i have guy friends, i'm a slut  if i stand up for myself, i'm mouthy  seems like you can't do anything now a days without being labeled  so what, go ahead and label me, see if i give a crap  repost this if you're proud of who you are "
just a chill day 
depressed and not feeling good   
"busy as always, barely have time to breathe lately "
"my cat has been attached to my hip all day  love  now just enjoying a bowl of ice cream before bed  been a rough week, hopefully this week will be better "
why are all the ads on my facebook <propfemale> having to do with diets and dieting  i think facebook is hinting me   
not tired but have to wake up at 7am   bah 
last week and this week seem to suck 
"put this dog on\   ^ ^\\\\ your profile\( (_â€¢_)\\) to show\ _ ''*''\\_ that you are\(,,,)^(,,,) against animal cruelty"
<propfemale> tired   wish i could go back to bed   -___-
"it is sooo gorgeous out today! i have to work later today but maybe i will do therapy outside! the kid loves the outdoors so, i am sure there will be no complaints  smile  "
today appears to be a homework day   
"is disgusted with most cat food companies  i found out that the third ingredient in iams proactive health is basically a form of ground up wood chips  you can find this ingredient in most low cost pet foods like purina, meow mix, etc  so i bought cat food from a highly recommended company called blue buffalo which has all natural ingredients with no fillers  two other recommended brands are bynature, and wellness "
"it's kind of nice to know that my supposed \friends\"" only want to <propfemale> out with me if they have nothing better to do or no one better to <propfemale> out with  that's the story of my life i guess """
is very sick today with a fever    sad   it keeps rising and i have a really sore throat and an ear ache too so it looks like there will be a trip to the doctor planned for me   
started feeling even more sick today! i am so sick of being sick!  sad 
"i keep hearing about everyone having so much fun yet i am stuck at home with tons of homework, sick, and exhausted   where's my fun???"
