listening to my 2 youngest talking to each other or 1 is humming while the other is making sword fighting noises when they are supposed to be going to sleep   it is so funny!  we tell them to stop talking and go to sleep   but that lasts about 1 minute and then they start talking again   this goes on for about an hour  : )
scary!  there was a tornado warning just issued in san mateo county!
enjoying my day off   soooo quiet!  love it!  now   i should probably get something done that i can't do when i'm at work  nap?  clean floors?  clean out fridge?  go pick up something for lunch?  hmmmm     maybe i'll just sit here and meditate?  so many choices i don't know what to do and the day is going by soooo fast!  : )
either school work is getting harder at a younger age    or i'm getting dumber!   i used to feel confident about helping my kids up until at least 5th grad (sad i know)    but now i'm questioning my ability while helping my 3rd grader! : )  think i need to go back to school!!!
