"best divorce letter ever\dear wife, iâ€™m writing you this letter to tell you that iâ€™m leaving you forever  iâ€™ve been a good man to you for 7 years & i have nothing to show for it  these last 2 weeks have been hell      your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today & that was the last straw  last week, you came home & didnâ€™t even notice i had a new haircut, had cooked your favorite meal & even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers  you ate in 2 minutes, & went straight to sleep after watching all of your soaps  you donâ€™t tell me you love me anymore; you donâ€™t want sex or anything that connects us as husband & wife  either youâ€™re cheating on me or you donâ€™t love me anymore; whatever the case, iâ€™m gone  your ex-husband p s  donâ€™t try to find me  your sister & i are moving away to west <propfemale> together! have a great life!\\â€”â€” dear ex-husband nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter  itâ€™s true you & i have been married for 7 years, although a good man is a far cry from what youâ€™ve been  i watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining & griping too bad that doesnâ€™t work  i did notice when you got a hair cut last week, but the 1st thing that came to mind was â€˜you look just like a girl!â€™ since my mother raised me not to say anything if you canâ€™t say something nice, i didnâ€™t comment  and when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with my sister, because i stopped eating pork 7 years ago  about those new silk boxers: i turned away from you because the $49 99 price tag was still on them, & i prayed it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed $50 from me that morning  after all of this, i still loved you & felt we could work it out  so when i hit the lotto for 10 million dollars, i quit my job & bought us 2 tickets to jamaica but when i got home you were gone   everything happens for a reason, i guess  i hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted  my lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you wonâ€™t get a dime from me  so take care  signed, your ex-wife, <propmale> as hell & free! p s  i donâ€™t know if i ever told you this, but my sister <propfemale> was born <propfirst>  i hope thatâ€™s not a problem "

"saturday morning, part 2: can't return to sleep so now i am waging war on my house     scrubbing the paint off the cabinets, punishing the floors with my mop and broom, baseball tossing clothes in the washer and dryer, poisoning the air with cleaning agent toxins      and listenin' to <propfemale> wright  #chronicles of the insanity of hormonal discord *puts up my beware of fool sign*"
