facebook is obnoxious when it comes to making a new profile  - -'
my mind  the worst place to wander and get lost in 
so should of worn the waterproof mascarra   now i look like a <propfemale> lavinge wanna be   awesome  - -'
i love it when my music growls at me   smile 
today is that day where everything comes crashing down and turns me into one angry ball of a person   annoyed 
and the ground caved in between where we were standing 
from june 27-july 15th i get to see my wisconsin smile  anyone wanna chill at that time??  laugh 
"in honor of father's day we're trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your father and keep it there till june 19 th  ? if you like this idea, please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many great fathers we can get on facebook  ?"
"in honor of father's day, i have changed my profile picture the man who has been more of a father to me than anyone  he may not be my father by blood, but he is by heart and soul  <propfirst> ritchie   smile  love  i know you don't use facebook, but thank you so much for being there for me, and my siblings   love "
