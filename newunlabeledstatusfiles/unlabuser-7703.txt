"watching once more as the world passes me by, surrounded but still all alone, am i living a lie? empty faces, empty eyes, are staring right through me, no regrets but i still ask why, take me away, to a peace i've never known, where my life can be my own, this is the price i've paid and it's taken it's toll, can it be too much to ask for the time it stole?"
"all the smiles you've had to fake and all the bullshit you've had to take, just to lead us here again, i never have the things to say to make it all just go away, to make it all just disapear, it's my life, it's my choice, hear my words, hear my voice, so just believe,"

"how does paper beat rock?? yeah, i'll go throw a rock at you and see what happens when you defend yourself with a piece of paper "
"i will not return to the countless mistakes of the past, i will not re-live the failures of the man i once was, only through dedication will i destroy all preconception, no longer will i let myself be truly satisfied with the standard, let this be the day of my declaration, join me, walk with me, shatter the bonds that tie    us to what we strive to never be"
"i've done everything as you say, i've followed your rules without question, i thought it would help me see things clearly, but instead of helping me to see, i look around and it's like i'm blinded, i'm spinning out of control, i'm out of control, where should i go? what should i do? i don't understand what you want from me, cause i don't know if i can trust you, i don't understand what you want from me!!"
"don't tell me i can not go, when the wound in me refuses to mend, deliver me from all of this, it seems the whole e playful erience is, terrible and crippling, the pain is much more then physical beyond belief, typical enough for me and i burn inside in agony, what power will enable me to make this decision? despair is hauling over me, no way to hide the agony, embracing my calamity, to save myself once and for all"
"lashing out the action, returning the reaction, weak are ripped and torn away, hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower, battery is here to stay, smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me, cannot stop the battery, pounding out aggression, turns into obsession, cannot kill the battery, cannot kill the family, battery is found in me!"

"born to bleed, fighting to succed, built to endure what this world throws at me"
"through all the happiness and sorrow, i guess i'd do it all again, live for today and not tomorrow, it's still the road that never ends, the wreckage of my past keeps haunting me, it just won't leave me alone, i still find it all a mystery, could it be a dream? the road to nowhere leads to me"
"if slowpoke is a psychic pokemon, does that mean he can predict the present?"
"hey, here's an idea, why dont you stop fucking complaining and do something about it!"
"this is not a one way road, youâ€™re headed for the dead end, you might think youâ€™re everything to everyone, well pardon me if i intrude, youâ€™re not a perfect person in a perfect world, look at where your ignorance has brought you, all this will be buried, like the fall of rome, you will come crashing down, the truth hurts, but denialâ€™s what will kill you, all that you loved, all that you treasure, will pass with time"

"i can't show pain, long for the days, when i am free to feel, don't want to lose everything, just want to feel again, my heart would burst for you if that would make things right, i don't feel anything outside the pain you bring, starting over doesn't look so bad this time, i am not empty inside, though i long to make this right"
"and i feel the pain still deeply, it seems sometimes too much to bear,but i have a core within me still, my strength is there, and i am still my own, and i can't be made less, i know who i am"
"full of fear, everclear, i'll be here, fighting forever, curious, venomous, you'll find me, climbing to heaven, nevermind, turn back time, you'll be fine, i'll get left behind, show me what it's like to dream in black and white, so i can leave this world tonight, holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life, it only hurts just once, they're only broken bones, hide the hate inside, so i can leave this world behind"

"caught between the great mortal divide, not quite dead but still not quite alive, now go    into the light but i can't tell you the reasons why i'll never join you there, i must face this hell alone, spiraling through this continuum, time has taken all i've known, smothering the life i used to love and all i've got is time  i can't face this hell alone, spiraling through this continuum"

"do you ever feel like crying? do you ever feel like giving up? i raise my hands up towards the sky, i say this prayer for you tonight, because nothing is impossible, sometimes we're helpless and alone, but you can let it keep you weighted down, you must go on, the hardest part isn't finding who we need to be, it's being content with who you are, stay who you are "
"im sick of being sick and tired, sick of understanding, tired of feeling sick to my stomach, demons inside command me, they're saying crush it, break it, smash it, fuckin' kill 'em all! laugh as it falls away, i won't dodge another silver bullet just to save a little face, how many people really care? how many will be standing? i'll light the match, the flame, the fuse, the bomb, rescue the world from slavery"
"what an anemic charade, a soulless display, we force upon ourselves and all of the worldand needless to say, this sterile cliche has left me with another shovel down in a hole, i'm digging in vain, i'm digging in vain, but when it boils down to a distraction nothing compares, all i wanted was a haven away but i've traded neuroticism in for despair "
"things are not what they used to be, missing one inside of me, deathly lost, this can't be real, cannot stand this hell i feel, emptiness is filling me, to the point of agony, growing darkness taking <propfemale>, i was me but now he's gone, no one but me can save myself, but its to late, now i can't think of a reason why i should even try"
evil is always possible and goodness is eternally difficult
"find my control, find reasons to beat this, find truth below the lies and the wreckag, i can't let go, i'm too close, too restless, i'm letting you know i'm far too aggressive, broke! inside, this life, you can never be reborn within, i came this far, erase my scars, fight! this time, inside, take a break from the lie you live, i came this far erase my scars"
"so tell me why you've choosen me, don't want your grip, don't want your greed, i'll tear me open, make you gone, no more can you hurt anyone"
"another reason, another cause for me to fight, another fuse uncovered now, for me to light, my dedication to all that i've sworn to protect, i <propfemale> out my orders with not a regret, a declaration, embedded deep under my skin, a permanent reminder of how we began, no hesitation when i am commanding the strike, you need to know that you're in for the fight of your life"
"you will be shown how i've become indestructible, determination that is incorruptible, from the other side, a terror to behold, annihilation will be unavoidable, every broken enemy will know that their opponent had to be invincible, take a last look around while you're alive, i'm an indestructible master of war"
"an obvious disinterest, a barely managed smile, a deep nod in agreement, a status quo exile, i shirk my obligations, i miss all your deadlines, i excel at quitting early, and fucking up my life, life for you has been less than kind, so take a number stand in line, we've all been sorry, we've all been hurt but how we survive is what makes us who we are"
"now i am become death, destroyer of worlds"
"you really think you have a <propmale> against the army in my head? fighting like you took my family and say i'll never see them again, you can't understand how serious i take the way you look at me, my intention isn't to discuss this, it's to see if you can bleed, you can try hard, as hard as you can, never gonna bring me down, you're gonna fight but i'm gonna win, never gonna bring me down"
"all my devotion betrayed, i am no longer afraid, i was too blinded to see how much you've stolen from me, you want to know why i feel so horrified? i've let my innocence die, you want to know why i can't be pacified? you made me bury something, i won't be sleeping tonight, i only wanted a blessing made now i've been labeled a renegade, it seems so clear now what i must do, you're no immortal"
"and i will see you through the smoke and flames, on the frontlines of war  and i will fight my battle till i fall or i conquer them all!!!"
"all because of you i haven't slept in so long and when i do i dream of drowning in the ocean, longing for the shore where i can lay my head down, inside these arms of yours, all because of you i believe in angels, not the kind with wings, no, not the kind with halos, the kind that take you home, when home becomes a strange place, i'll follow your voice, all you have to do is shout it out!"
"in a changing world, i overcame time and searched for the future in the scratched sky on an endless night, even if the twinkling light leaves me i'll make my way to my dream at the place that i go around, the miracle should come true"
"bloodshed begets bloodshed, hatred begets hatred, a powerfull festering energy roots itself in this land and craves a crest of blood, with just a little information, and a little shove to the people violence turns out  this is because humans are very simple  no matter how many times they repeat it, they're unable to learn from it  humans are such stupid and sad creatures   "
"refusal of hope, solution demise â€“ bury the truth in a mountain of lies  wonâ€™t bow to man, wonâ€™t bow to government, wonâ€™t trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust, wonâ€™t love a world where my god is mocked  i defy! this is what you try to sell me? subjective nothingness? pull your sickness from my throat â€“ let me breathe the truth "
"won't bow to man, won't bow to government, won't bow to greed, won't bow to false hope, won't bow to self, won't bow to modern code, won't sell my soul to a dead world, i defy!"
"dig open the pain youre hiding, give your hand to the faith youre fighting,the void you suffer is a curse forever bleeding inside,now you embrace the fatal sickness you should despise, remember the day you lost that, where is the shame that will bring your soul back? not i! i wont conform to what i see in you, not i!i wont surrender what i am,not i! and even if it was a part of me, not i! i'll never be that way again"
"i know i'm not the perfect one, this pain has just begun, it's something i already <propmale>, i already <propmale>, you bring me to a better path, it's everything i asked, it's something i don't wanna face, i don't wanna face, there's nothing left! the fear is gone! and when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you, before i make my final run, i will stay with you, decay with you"
"save sorrow for the souls in doubt, bleed every care out, will you <propfemale> me down the aisle that final day? with your tears and cold hands shaking from the weight, when you lower me down beneath that sky of gray, let the rain fall down and wash away your pain"
"so now i reap what i have sewn, and any rapture i had shown has bled dry, and i walked the streets alone, accepting pain i'd never known, as you died, then i hurt myself to see it too, to feel the knife i put in you, my heart as broken as my ways, i never should've let it pass, this fall was never meant to last, the reason gone and damage stays"
"shed rejection, learn to follow the wolves"
"ever since the day that i was made i've been deciding the end and i was made of wood and stone and won't diminish or bend, so when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away i'll be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay, nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me, i call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me"
im thinking of having an end of summer get together  maybe a trip to six flags or somethin like that  anyone intrested?
"behold the loyal slave,his rotting shell now a tomb where death can play,see now his pride caves in,alone he fights to stop this dark decay,fainter grows each plea from skies above,break through the ribcage,tear the heart out from everyone that you love,show me the path that leads into your mind,release the thoughts you lock so deep inside,show me,im the one who knew this pain,release,before you fall into this again"
"i see the weight of hollow death residing in you, take now your final breath â€“ exhale the truth, i see the fear of nothing left, dead fragments of you, you hold it in yourself â€“ i feel it too "
"now the dark begins to rise, save your breath its far from over, leave the lost and dead behind, nows your <propmale> to run for cover, i dont wanna change the world, i just wanna leave it colder, light the fuse and burn it up, take the path that leads to nowhere, all is lost again but im not giving in, i will not bow!i will not break!i will shut the world away,i will not fall!i will not fade!i will take your breath away"
"behind the eyes of my compassion lies a suffering soul and in my blood a bitter darkness slowly taking it's toll, i feel the death of our connection and the fading of light between the shards of sudden panic i see the scars of your addiction and the feeling you hide"
"we are the sons of holy wrath, a shining light in the dark, the ones who walk amongst despair, no sign of fear in our hearts, stand in death's way, shut out the voice of mindlessness, open your eyes to the truth, believe the words that stand the test and not the slurs of the youth, you're not what they say, turn over the tables and watch them run, you'll be the weapon they can't outgun"
"and now we will rise to conquer them all  many will challenge, many will fall  bring us your vile, malicious of mind  we will bring their neck to the line  scum of the earth  power of air  you wanted the world? weâ€™ll bury you there  this is a battle  we are the blade  and this is the line, this is the line  all that they build we will break  this is the line    this is the line!!"
"no vow of silence, no remission of truth"

"and i looked up and saw you, i know that you saw me, we froze but for a moment in empathy, i brought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug, you gave my emptiness a name, and you ran away now all my friends are gone, maybe weâ€™ve outgrown all the things that we once loved, runaway! but what are we running from? a show of hands from those in this audience of one, where have they gone?"
"there you stood in disbelief, trying all you could to see through these lies, and every word that i could breathe would you find more inclined to leave, but i tried, i tried, and knowing what i've done to you, with every thought you suffer through, my heart as black as evil can, and everything i could have been erased by what i wanted then, i couldn't think a lesser man"
"come inside and be afraid of this impressive mess i've made, if you take a look now you will find, i have throne away my vice, done away with paradise, see what's going on inside my mind, please let me out, please let me out, branded like an animal, i can still feel them burning my mind, i believe that you made your message clear, i think i am loosing my mind"
"find my control, my reasons to beat this, find truth below the lies and the wreckage, i can't let go, i'm too close, too restless, i'm letting you know, i'm far too aggressive, don't be alone inside a world that's filled with make-believe, broke! inside, this life you can never be reborn within, i came this far erase my scars, fight! this time, inside take a break from the lie you live, i came this far erase my scars"
"ive gotta make a stand but i am just a man im not superhuman, who's gonna fight for whats right? who's gonna help us survive? we're in the fight of our lives and we're not ready to die, who's gonna fight for the weak? who's gonna make em believe? ive got a hero livin in me, im gonna fight for whats right, today im speaking my mind and if it kills me tonight i will be ready to die, a hero's not afraid to give his life"

"perpetual motion the image wont focus, a blur is all that's seen, but here in this moment like the eye of the storm it all came clear to me, i found a shoulder to <propfemale> on, an infallible reason to live all by itself, i took one last look from the heights that i once loved and then i ran like hell"
"seemingly endless, beckoning debt   beckoning debt  vacant and nameless â€“ where is the end? aching just to endure again â€“ sweet loss  able again to feel  this is real  just breathe, suffer again  look back  stand in the wake and breathe  wait for the end  fight back! this isnâ€™t over!"

"not falling victim to the fire that burns inside of me, though i am fearful i will not prevent this tragedy, my strength's been tested, i wear the scars that prove, still i believe that this calling will see me through"
"a wise man once said that which does not kill us makes us stronger, thought i was dead, so am i now invincible? determination, perseverance, resolution, resurrection!! reality kicked in, raced against time just to start all over, treated like shit, pushed aside and e playful endable, all the beatings you gave me, i will use them against you!!"

nos es invictus
"now you want to take me down, as if i even care, i am the monster in your head, and i thought you'd learn by now, it seems you haven't yet, i am the venom in your skin, and now your life is broken, after the lights go out on you, after your worthless life is through, i will remember how you screamed, i can't afford to care"
"and when the end shines new with the burn of nothing left, i'll give you one last <propmale> to say you're done and give it back, i won't agree, your remedy is a joke, i can't believe that you can breathe and not choke, you've brought this verdict on yourself, i hope you cry for the one's you've lost, you built this burden when you fell, i hope it's worth all the blood it cost "
"a man chooses, a slave obeys!"
"bitter thoughts became your every waking breath, save the nights your hollow dreams revealed the sweet release of death, in your thoughts you played a symphony of self but your soul had bled a darker song of close to nothing left, oh, the deliverance of blade and flame, your love, and greater is the blood"
"call this number!!!!!\973-409-3260\it is a message to all!!!!"
"i know i'm not the perfect one, this pain has just begun, it's something i already <propmale>, i already <propmale>, you bring me to a better path, it's everything i asked, and when my heartstrings come undone, i will wait for you, i will pray for you, before i make my final run, i will stay with you, decay with you"
"broken teath, a shattered jaw, ten to one, behold my god, wicked sons of heaven's loss, raise your own inverted cross, <propmale>'s of earth, iron fist, serve the sacred you dismissed, stand before your final day, choke on every line you pray!! raise your glass to death, not one second left! wake the lifeless, die to fight this, stand beside me  storm the gates of hell!!"
"i see so much corruption and it's hard to ignore, living on greed and possessions, is this what we're dying for? many are willing to only live for themselves, turning away from morality, you feel dissolved and the water's beginning to rise, become the light in this darkened world, now change will come, it's in your hands, it's in your hands, now choose this day, who you will serve to be the light in a darkened world?"
rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated
"talking shit behind my back, dare you say it to my face? i've heard the words roll out your lips, you little trendy fuckin' bitch! the time has come to get you some, cause i just do not give a shit! you wanna disrespect me, you little fuckin' punk? everything i've done?, and who i am? as far as i've fuckin' come? i'll slap you so fuckin' hard, it'll feel like you kissed a freight train  fuck you!"
"do you take me for a fool!? how's it feel to be a tool!? talking shit behind my back    see to me you're just a cancer! the time has come to get you some, motherfucker! war is the answer!"
"you think you're so tough? you're a living bluff, i will put you down, i will make you drown, i will make you bleed, i cannot feel pain, i might be insane, i am victory, i write history, feel my fist on your face, you hate this, i feel great, i am be furious now, i am making time for fighting, i think it's time to beat you"
"i want you to trust me, i want you to believe me, i want to feel your eyes, i want to control every heartbeat, i want to hear your voices, i want to disturb the peace, i want you to see me well, i want you to understand me, i want your fantasy, i want your energy, do you see me? do you understand me? do you feel me? do you hear me?"
"the gavel has fallen,along with the rest are we e playful ected to settle for this?bring us the plague,lead us away,blacken tomorrow with ash of today,cant you see the fabric of our standards wearing thin?see our world in its grave at the hands of the enslaved wont bow to man wont bow to government wont bow to greed wont bow to false hope wont bow to self wont bow to modern code wont sell my soul to a dead world! i defy!"
it's the oldest story in the book    the boy desires the one thing he cannot have
"believe me, you've never met a mother fucker like me, bet you've never seen the things that i've seen, bottled up inside this time, i'm taking back my life, i'm rising up, i've had enough! i'm feeling invincible tonight, i'm alive, take a look into my eyes, i'm take you for a ride, i'm invincible tonight"
"get ready to settle the score, and get ready to face the floor, cause its time to remember, this is war!! and its on tonight, so get up and fight, get up and fight, you had all your life to run and hide so step up, step up!! lets do this!!"
new profile pic! comment on its brutality!!!!
"so now i try, but the blade is primed to just cut me down again, to no avail, this fix divine was wrought to do me in  seemingly endless, beckoning debt, vacant and nameless, where is the end? aching just to endure again sweet loss, able again to feel  this is real  just breathe, suffer again  look back  stand in the wake and breathe, wait for the end  fight back  this isnâ€™t over "
"one more day, this time iâ€™ll bite the bullet, let me stay and set this life ablaze, give myself to compromise and let the hammer fall, from blackened eyes to broken ties, iâ€™ve bled to know them all, driven to the brink of death, i heed deceptions call, through bitter tears, forgotten years, iâ€™ve come to sever all"
*insert random generic funny comment here*
"out of the night that covers me, black as a pit from pole to pole, i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul, in the fell clutch of circumstance i have niether winced nor cried aloud, under the bludgeoning of <propmale> my head is bloody but unbowed"
it's time to reconfirm and reset  time to learn to let go    to find out who to save    and who to burn
"reckless and weary the truth has been buried, held down by the hand that refuses to <propfemale> the burden you built, the lies, do you hear me? the insult, the white flag you refuse to <propfemale>, i'm letting you go and all that you showed me , i'm letting you know that you don't control me, the feeling is cold and life is unfolding, reckless and weary, i'm desperately holding on"
"it's in this wake that i find myself losing the will to resume this hell, when every breath is a dying wish, it's harder to follow the point of this, this broken place that i call my home has deepened the sorrow that i have sown and i can't erase what is in my heart, i want it to finish before it starts, i've been fading away, i've been waiting on the call to reach my veins"
"nothing left but a broken man, terrified of everything, nothing left of his foolish pride, his fond memories slowly die, then as he wakes again alone, still a prisoner in his home, ready to allow the dark to penetrate his broken heart, and i'm still afraid of the light and a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise, now if i am to survive\the infection must die, murder the beast that's been eating me alive"
"i think we as humans have an overwhelming tendency to live shallow lives, never giving thought to the â€œbigger pictureâ€� or things of an eternal nature  we live day-to-day, too busy or preoccupied to take a moment and really assess our purpose in life, and how that reflects on things like our mortality "
"i'm burning bridges for the last time, i'm breaking habits for the first time, i saw my future today, it said i'm going away, but i still haven't <propfirst> the last line on my way down    i'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade, i'm not ready to die!!"
"i have suffered defeat, pain, loss, still i push to the edge, never falter, for this cements my beliefs, i'll remain my own master, i am a mortal man, but i'm not falling i'm not broken yet, i am a mortal man, but i'll hold tight to my beliefs now"
"how do i live without the ones i love? time still turns the pages of the book it's burned, place and time always on my mind, i have so much to say but you're so far away, sleep tight, i'm not afraid, the ones that we love are here with me, lay away a place for me cause as soon as i'm done, i'll be on my way to live on eternally "
"don't let the world deceive you, don't let their words betray you, don't let their lies deceive you, let them do their worst, we will not die this way, this is absolution! death claims us no more! do not grieve, end the suffering, we will live, live eternal, will you take the stand amongst the dead? bury your fear and hold fast to life "
"the world will tell you to lead yourself  i believe that humans are a flawed people, and that man, given unto his own will, will fail  using our flesh as a compass in life is a path that leads only to destruction  the burden of relying only on yourself is like a weight around your neck, and when the people and forces of the world encourage me to live this way, i tell them to save their breath"
"i'm not a man on a mission but a rising anger forces me to stand and count my voice defiant, i'm not opposed to the process but the facts before us demonstrate that we must stand united"
"the fire it rages, it burns clear in the night, illuminates the path before us, now true our arrows strike, defy, we heed the call, defy, strengthen us all, defy, for we are many rising against you, now the tide is turning, our might striking fear, our passion foretells our triumph, smite those who stand against us!!"
"cold light above us, hope fills the heart and fades away, skin white as winter as the sky returns to grey, days go on forever but i have not left your side, we can <propmale> the dark together, if you go then so will i, there is nothing left of you, i can see it in your eyes, i keep holding onto you but i can't bring you back to life, sing the anthem of the angels then say the last goodbye"
"everyday i see my life rewind tearing through dreams i find im wide awake  every single time i feel the burn i try to throw it away, a fast fix for the brokenness of everyday, its like the pain is building up, it's swelling up, i've got to choke it down and break it down until it's broken, it's like a shard of glass, it's like a broken piece of everything i hate, it's everything in me"
"wake up screaming, i'm awake and dreaming, and i won't stop breathing until my heart stops beating, this isn't me i used to say, all the love was so gone, it feels good to be alive, i've been dead for so long"
"there is reason behind everything  i dig through the lies to find a truth i hoped wasnt true, yet deep down i know it is  and once again i am proven right, and my peace of mind is shattered only to be replaced by unbridled rage "
"how did you think i would feel? you threw me aside again, i won't let you hurt me again, i'm nothing to you i can see, just walk away from me, i'm torn up but i can't believe you sat and watched me bleed"
"find my control, find reasons to beat this, find truth below the lies and the wreckage, i can't let go, i'm too close, too restless, i'm letting you know, i'm far too aggressive, so if you can't get a word in its because i don't care what you think, don't be alone inside a world that's filled with make-believe, i came this far, erase my scars!"
party was fun  that is all 
"one more day, this time iâ€™ll bite the bullet  let me stayjust one more day and set this life ablaze, give myself to compromise and let the hammer fall, from blackened eyes to broken ties, iâ€™ve bled to know them all, driven to the brink of death i heed deceptions call, through bitter tears, forgotten years, iâ€™ve come to sever all"
"i won't agree, your remedy is a joke  i can't believe that you can breathe and not choke, i feel my lungs beginning to burn  with every foolish word that you spit, another nail is all you'll get "
"aww  isnt that cute, the cowboys decided to dress up as a football team for halloween"
"i don't need your forgiveness, i don't need your hate, i don't need your acceptance, so what should i do? i'll be sorry so you've said, i'm not sorry, bang! you're dead!"
"my own solution insufficient again, no false illusion, this devouring threat, i break the vessel, giving air to its red, and open my fate to the darkened sky, i've been fading away, i've been waiting on the call to reach my veins, ready or not, no attention to waste, every sorrow of the soul will read my name when i cease to exist!"
"time has had its way with me, my broken tired hands cant build a thing, the wires that have held me still embedded now in flesh define my will, the empty i have fed has made me numb, despite what you will find in me the failures of my past just swirl beneath, i need a heart that carries on through the pain when the walls start collapsing in, give me a soul that never ceases to fight despite the infection within"
"i'd give it all away, i'm willing to give up everything thats true, i've become numb to it all,cast to the world, just to wait for the fall, disonnect me! disconnet me! disconnect me from this harmful dream,this world is not designed for me,i reject this reality"
"no! you'll never be alone, when darkness comes i'll light the night with stars, hear my whispers in the dark, no! you'll never be alone, when darkness comes you know i'm never far, hear my whispers in the dark"
"who's gonna fight for what's right, who's gonna help us survive, we're in the fight of our lives and we're not ready to die, who's gonna fight for the weak, who's gonna make 'em believe, i've got a hero livin' in me, i'm gonna fight for whats right, today i'm speaking my mind and if it kills me tonight i will be ready to die, a hero's not afraid to give his life"
"you'll find me face down, hands bound, ready for the blade to make me two, if judgment falls to meet this ground, that fate will run me through, no day of wrath will see me break for that faithless breath of shame, when the heretics come to make that list, be true to speak my name, leave all you see, the curse of man is dead, the hourglass turned on its head and every care will fade away to wake a new day"
"planning to <propfemale> out in the feild between kensington and park place tomorrow  if anyone wants to <propfemale>, comment here "
"rock bottoms where we live, and still we dig these trenches to bury ourselves in them, backs breaking under tension, for far too long these voices, muffled by distances, it's time to come to our senses, up from the dirt,today i offer all myself to this, i'm living for my dying wish, i give it all, now there's a reason, there's a reason to give it all"
"all i have is one last chance,i won't turn my back on you,take my hand, drag me down,if you fall then i will too and i can save what's left of you,say something new,i have nothing left,i can't face the dark without you,there's nothing left to lose,i'm with you forever, the end"
fight or fall  there is no other choice!
"bitter thoughts became your every waking breath save the nights your hollow dreams revealed the sweet release of death, in your thoughts you played a symphony of self but your soul has bled a darker song of close to nothing left, every line a path into an empty heart, where the words of now forgotten love fall silent in the dark"
"choke back the burn of wrath as they violate your name, no sign of innocence in this godforsaken place, when the truth is in your hands they'll spit upon your face, dismantle the ground they stand on, give power a name, you've traveled the path of slander now bury the shame, shed rejection, learn to follow the wolves"
"one more day, this time iâ€™ll bite the bullet,, let me stay and set this life ablaze, give myself to compromise and let the hammer fall, from blackened eyes to broken ties iâ€™ve bled to know them all, driven to the brink of death, i heed deceptions call, through bitter tears, forgotten years, iâ€™ve come to sever all"
"god help me i've come undone, out of the light of the sun, i can feel you falling away, no longer the lost, no longer the same and i can see you starting to break, i'll keep you alive if you show me the way, forever - and ever, the scars will remain"
"that final day will fall and those who curse the sky will face the earth, the many turn to one, the god of gods' own righteous son"
"we are not creatures made to be alone and when we act as such we help our brothers to stand, i ask you to take heed of my words, to move with purpose to a future worth living, ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have, it is time to address the fact that alone, none of us can survive"
"a new voice for the broken souls in a world awaiting its death - i am you! an everlasting well of life for the hopeless and the wrecked, i am the dying self, the narrow path, the calm that conquered the storm - i am you! the crosshairs on the head of shame, the negation to conform"
"i will rise, i will break this, you will rise, you will break this, we will rise, we will take them down, rise and break them down"
"dein gluck ist nicht mein gluck, ist mein ungluck"
"searching for words, embracing their meaning, starving for hurt, erasing your feelings, replacing comfort with a false sense of sacrifice, waiting your turn for a guarantee to roll the dice, how does it feel? what does it mean to you, your heart is real! it isn't bulletproof! you can't conceal all of the things you do on your way down"
"the gavel has fallen, along with the rest, are we e playful ected to settle for this?bring us the plague, lead us away, blacken tomorrow with ash of today, canâ€™t you see the fabric of our standards wearing thin? see your world in its grave at the hands of the enslaved, wonâ€™t bow to man  wonâ€™t bow to government, wonâ€™t trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust, wonâ€™t love a world where my god is mocked! i defy!"
the best part of waking up isnt folgers in your cup  its knowing <propmale> <propmale> didnt kill you in your sleep
"find my control, find reasons to beat this, find truth below the lies and the wreckage, i can't let go, i'm too close, too restless, i'm letting you know, i'm far too aggressive, broke! inside, this life, you can never be reborn within, i came this far, erase my scars, fight! this time, inside, take a break from the lie you live, i came this far erase my scars!"
"well i won't back down, no i won't back down, you can stand me up at the gates of hell but i won't back down, well i know what's right, i got just one life, in a world that keeps on pushin' me around but i stand my ground and i won't back down"
"you'll find me face down, hands bound, ready for the blade to make me two, if judgment falls to meet this ground, that fate will run me through, no day of wrath will see me break for that faithless breath of shame, when the heretics come to make that list, be true to speak my name"
"leave all you see, the curse of man is dead, the hourglass turned on its head, and every care will fade away to wake a new day"
"go tell that long tongue liar, go and tell that midnight rider, tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter, tell 'em that god's gonna cut 'em down, you can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, but sooner or later god'll cut you down"
"you reap what you've sown  if you plant seeds of hate, you recieve hate  anger begets anger, sadness begets sadness  you cannot recieve happiness when all you seek is despair "
"now close this chapter, move on, keep telling myself that it's under to control, and that's a lie i did well know, i'll return to the scene of the crime, and i'll gather my pride, nausea comes as the fear builds inside, seems much stronger than i, still i know"
"into the nothing, faded and weary, i won't leave and let you fall behind, i live for the dying, heaven hear me! i know we can make it out alive!"
"i noticed everyone was changing thier profile picures to cartoon charecters, so i did the only logical thing     i made toast!!!"
"it's in this wake that i find myself, losing the will to resume this hell, when every breath is a dying wish it's harder to follow the point of this, this broken place that i call my home has deepened the sorrow that i have sown, and i can't erase what is in my heart, i want it to finish before it starts"
"so now i'm stuck here, between the guilty and the insincere, the words i spoke have left here all alone, i should have known this, i never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise, i wish it all gone, i could've burned it when i had that choice and now i'd die to kill this noise in my head!!"
"i know you feel it's all the same, but i promise that'll change, there's nothing left! the fear is gone! i know i'm not the perfect one, this pain has just begun, you bring me to a better path, it's everything i asked, when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you, before i make my final run i will stay with you, decay with you"
"not long ago you found the answers were so <propfemale> clear, within a day you find yourself living in constant fear, can you look at yourself now? can you look at yourself?! you can't win this fight, in a way it seems there's n surprise ne to call when our thoughts are so numb and feelings aren't sure, we all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find"
"i'm here for you and all mankind, i've lost my mind, psychotic, i'm in dementia, i won't be fine"
"you're lost inside, your pale addictions, i'll bury you, with the demons in the ash, can't heal you, don't want to, cause you can't save your-fuckin'-self, you are the one who made the decision stuck in a prison, shattered and broken, i am the one who, e playful ected to heal you, save you from drowning in your endless nightmare, blessed be the disillusioned, the banished misfit and the cursed hollow son"
"im burning bridges for the last time, im breaking habits for the first time!"
"i can't remember if i ever took a minute to say  that if it had to be now, i'm glad it had to be me  i can't recuperate, i'm never going to leave here alive  just help me through this, don't let me die here  i'm infected with you, pull the plug already, i'm killing time just trying to find the words that fall so short of you  i'm loosing sleep, i can't compete, i'm giving up, i can't do this alone"
that e playful lains everything
"i've got to find a way to stop before it starts! finding its way through my veins right to my heart, i never thought it something everyone could see, and it kills within me, i won't, i won't leave without a trace, i won't be erased!"
"i feel it crawling up my spine, but i'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline, you'll never fade me out, you'll never turn me off, you'll never reach the end, you'll never hear enough, you're half-grasp can't exterminate my stand, you can't rule with a broken upper hand!!"
"bury the fallen and lead the blind, i will fight the loss, dead inside, into the nothing, faded and weary, i won't leave and let you fall behind, i live for the dying, heaven hear me, i know we can make it out alive!"
"behold the loyal slave, his rotting shell now a tomb where death can play, see now his pride caves in, alone he fights to stop this dark decay, feed the lust you need and fainter grows each plea from skies above, break through the ribcage and tear the heart out from everyone that you love"
"take cover in these words, you are not alone, there is a purpose, through the loneliness and depression, through the tribulation, find redemption, this is not in vain, all will be revealed when the balance is broken"
"remember when you ran away and i got on my knees and begged you not to go because id go berserk? well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see ive gone completely pout of my mind!"
can i speak spainish? studies say niet!
"i will bend  i will break  i will fall  but i will not give up  i will not run  i will not hide or turn a blind eye  i am not invincible or indestructable, but my will is  im not going anywhere  i'll always be here  no matter how screwed up my life beomces, i'll always have time to help with yours  im determined and loyal to a fault"
"and everyday i feel like this weight's constantly dragging me down, broken for the last time, i've got a heart of steel, but your words are constantly bringing me down  i'm open for the first time, but you'll never get the best of me, wont' get the best of me!"
"been dead last but found my way to the front, with my inspirational quotes on why i never gave up! if you can't stand the pressure stay the fuck out of my way! i know my place! this one goes out to everyone who's lied to my face! i'm making a difference, i'm taking a <propmale>, you can say what you want about me, but no one can tell me i can't!"
"put a ?] if you ever had a crush on me   \[like] this status if you think im a good friend   \[message] me if you ever wanted to date me   \[comment] if we ever had any good memories together   \now lets see whose brave enough to copy this to their status smile "
"cry havoc, ? ???????? ????? ?????"
"farewell to false pretension, farewell to hollow words, farewell to fake affection, farewell, tomorrow burns, you soaked your heart in gasoline, i'll light it up and burn!"
"you and i wake up to the zombie apocalypse together  using only 4 words what do you say to me? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this in your status so i can comment on yours"
"broken, or so you say, nobody bought that fable anyway, so calloused, and so naive, to wear a heart of fiction on your sleeve, don't tell me it's not your choice, you sold a blessed future for some noise, with every waking second you front another real life loses ground, ten thousand arms outstretched and you have the nerve to strike them all? no reason to coexist? you've no reason to exist!!"
"on a scale of 1-10, how mentally stable do you think i am? 10 being stable 1 being bat-crap crazy "
waidmanns heil!
"emotions still touch me, still i can't feel a thing, like ghosts they melt into the fog and leave me cold, only shadows and impressions are left for me to hold, my heart would burst for you if that would make you whole, but i am not empty inside, still i long to make this right"
"im falling down, i cant wake up  i cannot hold on, but i will not let go!!"
"needless to say this sterile cliche has left mewith another shovel down in this hole, so now im diggin in vain but when it boils down to a distraction nothing compares! all i wanted was a haven away but i traded nueroticism in for despair, and just in case theres any doubt i'll say it now    f*ck th world! im headin underground  dont mind me, i'll just be makin my way down"
"in the end it's not about what you have, in the end it's all about where you wanna go and the route you take to help you get there, i hope you think that's fair cause you've only got one life to lead  so don't take for granted those little things    those little things are all that we have"
"i rely on myself just making sure that was clear, i'm not in need of your crutches, i face all my fears and i want what i knew i could have, life is not a monster, you just gotta make the best of what you have"
"forget everything just for tonight, we'll sing like everyone when their alone, cause i've been waiting for tonight to sing whoa, whoa, lets believe that if we all stand together we're a force that could shake the whole world, for once i'm doing something right when we say woah"
"i speak the truth, and everybody else knows it, so set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it!, can't waist my time on hateful people like you, so keep wishing you were me and i'll keep making you have to "
"dig yourself a shallow grave, your life is not the legacy of honor you would dig six feet for, broken is the way you came and broken is the way that you will leave when everything is paid for, dead is the way you stake your life on, the oblivious belief, what a waste to sell your spirit for!"
"i've always been a man of action, never let anything keep a hold of me, could always tell when somethings missing, like i knew everything, except for you and me, i can't make you want to stay, you're not that strong but it's broken you away, i still gave it everything, i guess i'll never catch my break"
"i hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends dont give a f*ck, don't tell me that it's just bad luck, when willi find where i fit in?"
"many are willing to only live for themselves, turning away from morality, nothing can save them now, now choose this day who you will serve to be the light in a darkened world, you feel dissolved and the water's beginning to rise, become a light in this darkened world, this is <propfemale>, the choice is now defined, no more deception, now change will come"
"??? ??????? ????, ????? ???????\it's a good day to die!"
"bitter thoughts became your every waking breath, save the nights your hollow dreams revealed the sweet release of death, in your thoughts you played a symphony of self but your soul has bled a darker song of close to nothing left, you'll find it in the veil of night where solitude is born, in the emptiness of broken flesh, at the mercy of the thorns"
"what the fuck am i doing? i can't tell the difference from wrong and right, i second guess my decisions cause i haven't been this person in my whole life, don't think you've got to go in alone here, i thought this was what you wanted , someone who gets everything right, i thought this was what you wanted, someone to put you first in their life, cause we're running out of time"
"it's taking every bit of me to keep this all inside, i've never been the type to turn my back and run, it's just never appealed to me to be the same as everyone and when it comes to shove, and i can't see you through the black, i'm going to scream your name till you come back!!"
"why does it falter? we built it all ourselves  why does it hurt so bad, forsaking all this help? why are we choking on pills designed to heal? we threw our hearts away cause we're too afraid to feel"
"these words are a weapon for the ones in pain, a fair fight for the children of a lesser name, we are the war against the sick and fatal fall of man, a hollow tip to the notion of a godless stand, quick to slam the gavel on a true solution, you let the fear become a stranglehold, tear it all apart so you can render your own belief, you never listened to what you were told"
"in the end it's not about what you have, in the end it's all about where you wanna go and the route you take to help you get there, i hope you think that's fair, cause you've only got one life to lead so don't take for granted those little things, those little things are all that we have"
"no more are the days that i will fear for i have found a strength that none can match and i'll push further, now i feel the passion burning, this what drives me further strengthens my resolve to push me further "
"i'd hate to keep you all wondering, i'm constant like the seasons, and i will never be a forgotten man, let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken  all i want is a place to call my own, to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone, you know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low "
"your words swarm me through my soul like locusts, eating away at any glimpse of focus  their eyes flaming red like pain, filling the void once righteous and bloodstained, but words can't kill the light inside me that tears me from the hate that binds me, i feel it crawling up my spine but i'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline!"
"driving the highway with nothing to do, future fading away, the stereo is pumping metallica tunes, ride the lightning, oh yeah! the car might be stolen, my clothes smell like dirt, born to ramble and play, play with fire, drunk in denial, always in for a fight, i've been in the dark side of town they are bringing me in, they call me the wild rover of hell"
"a free lesson on growing up; make the best of their worst and never compromise what you feel is right, i make a point to be powerful when i speak, be the one that gives them nightmares when they sleep, never back down from anyone!"
"can i just say one more thing? i'm not gonna bombard you with cliche's, but what i will say is this: it's the end of the world"
"this wreckage you'll never be, if you were raised in hell you'd be like me! don't tell me it's not your choice, you sold a blessed future for some noise! bury every sign of life in filth and hollow trend and push against progression on the path of logic's end, like tears flowing upward!"
"before my very last day i'm making it stop, i'm turning it off  i'll fight the feeling i have until everything's gone! resistance has won, now time is healing these wounds and you are still here releasing my fear, my life fell out of my hands, they took it away, i'm taking it back!!"
"for now i am in control, choosing my own fate, and now i sleep at night because i'm not afraid, my demons haunting me, i chased them all away, i've conquered all my fears, my <propfemale> awaits, i'm no longer slipping, i'm not slipping away! no one's out to get me, no one will get in my way! no longer upside down, i've turned my life around! im more than meets the eye!"
"sixteen, oh holy day your time has come and passed, the rapture weâ€™ve been waiting for has come to us at last, sixteen for every fake, sixteen to every whore, wipe that dirt from off your face sixteen is at your door, farewell to false pretension, farewell to hollow words, farewell to fake affection, farewell tomorrow burns"
"i won't leave without a trace, i won't be erased "
"the wind is blowing cold, have we lost our way tonight?have we lost our hope to sorrow? feels like we're all alone, running further from what's right and there are no more heroes to follow  so what are we becoming? where did we go wrong? i want to rise today and change this world, won't you rise today and change this world?"
"words can't kill the light inside me that tears me from the hate that binds me, i feel it crawling up my spine but i'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline, you'll never fade me out! you'll never turn me off! you'll never reach the end! you'll never hear enough! you're half-grasp can't exterminate my stand! you can't rule with a broken upper hand!"
"i know i'm not the perfect one, this pain has just begun, it's something i already <propmale>, i already <propmale>, you bring me to a better path, it's everything i asked, it's something i don't wanna face, i don't wanna face, there's nothing left! the fear is gone! and when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you, before i make my final run i will stay with you, decay with you"
i do not have a soul! i am a soul  i have a body 
"there's nothing left so save your breath, lying awake, caught inside this tidal wave, your cover's blown, no where to go, only your fate, loaded i will walk alone, fire your guns it's time to run, blow me away, i will stay in the mess i made, after the fall we'll shake it off, show me the way, only the strongest will survive, lead me to heaven when we die, i am the shadow on the wall, i'll be the one to save us all!"
"all is lost again, but i'm not giving in, i will not bow, i will not break, i will shut the world away, i will not fall, i will not fade, i will take your breath away, fall!"
"i tear on the leash that keeps me contained and controlled, let me go! i want to break free and fight my way out of this hole, one last hope to rise and break away, above the faded line, way beyond the ties that bind, this i know; the risk is worth the gain, it's worth the sacrifice, way beyond the ties that bind, i run but the chains pull me right back to the floor, i rattle the cage, i won't be your slave anymore!!"
"my secret side i keep hid under lock and key, i keep it caged but i can't control it, cause if i let him out he'll tear me up, break me down, why won't somebody come and save me from this make it end?! its hidin in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp, there's no escape for me, it wants my soul it wants my heart, no one can hear me scream, maybe its just a dream or maybe its inside of me! stop this monster !!"
"look into my eyes, do you see yourself? the reflection i see everyday, i'd bury my hate, but the pain is killing me, its killing me!! as i look in the mirror to see my face clearer, reflections of shame staring back at me, i choke on my wretchedness, the monster builds up inside me"
"what i've felt, what i've known, turn the pages, turn the stone, behind the\door, should i open it for you? yeah, what i've felt, what i've known, sick and tired i stand alone, could you be there, 'cause i am the one who waits for you? or are you unforgiven too?"
i finally have internet on my phone! this fills me with joy!
taks test tommorrow       fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-------
i woke up    with a clown's hands in my pants     thats what i did today   
"i hate it! cant take this! i wanna break your f*ckin bones! no mercy you faggot, shouldve left it all alone!"
"wer zu lebzeit gut auf erden, wird nach dem <propmale> ein engel werden, den blick gen himmel fragst du <propfemale>, warum man sie nicht sehen kann\live in virtue, no <propfemale>, in the grave an angel's choir, you look to heaven and wonder why, no one can see them in the sky"
"it's in my head, i can't forget what you once said, the words i read, the fractured soul that i can't mend, right here with me, killing the void i used to be, remembering through fading sparks of memory, two broken hands lift seven wounds and fight to stand"
"i want my anger to be healthy, and i want my anger just for me, and i want my anger not to control, and i want my anger to be me and i need to set my anger free"
"i want my anger to be healthy, and i want my anger just for me, and i want my anger not to control, and i want my anger to be me and i need to set my anger free"
24 hours  thats all the time you have left  how do you soend your final day?
"every single time i feel the burn i try to throw it away, a fast fix for the brokenness of everyday, its like the pain is building up, it's swelling up, i've got to choke it down and break it down until it's broke down! it's like a shard of glass, it's like a broken piece of everything i hate, it's everything in me! a burnt heart stains black the blood it flows, a dead soul will overshadow "
"burn it out, let it go, break it all, lose control, force it out, bring it through, pass it down, make it new! kill the pain, scrape it off, leave it here, make it stop! tear it down, bleed it out, all the hate, see it straight! no one ever told me that it would all stay the same! everyday i fall on shards of my hatred and shame!"
so i have no plans tonight  anyone wanna <propfemale> out?
"when all seems lost we count the cost, we still remain connected, we'll be made strong, we are not wrong, we will not be neglected, i take this doubt and cast it out, weakness will be rejected and through all wrongs we must stay strong, we will not be neglected!"
"devoutly wished for blinded eyes, this tragedy is like light to flies, this seems to suit you better, bleeding out the eyes  hope's left in chain suspension, holding onto lies to make the truth  those who run will be burned"
next person to mock my faith is getting a face full of my fist 
"wonâ€™t bow to man! wonâ€™t bow to government! wonâ€™t trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust, wonâ€™t love a world where my god is mocked, i defy!"
i like to taze people at the rennasaunce fair  it makes me feel like an evil wizard from the future
"why does it falter? we built it all ourselves  why does it hurt so much, rejecting all this help  why are we choking on pills designed to heal? we threw our hearts away 'cause we're to afraid to feel"
"farewell to false pretension, farewell to hollow words, farewell to fake affection, farewell, tomorrow burns"
"who would win in a fight, altair or ezio? only hidden blades, basic armor "
"we work in the darkness to protect the light  nothing is true, everything is permitted"
"(1 2) you dont understand me and you probably never will  ive a tendancy to self-destruct and a soft spot for the filth  a hair trigger temperment, a switchblad"
*insert funny clever serious status here*
"\how the blood soaked protestant hell did you do that?\""\",9d3af6dddc62520aa40d9383afdd2b1b,"the sun shines bright and anger rises, lorn and lonely torn apart  dont you think\its time to stop now? we were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss, lets pray that heaven is on our side, through violence and horror shall honour arise, so lets pray and blessed shall be our leader, we follow the <propmale> and bright, there on the battlefield he stands, down the battlefield he's lost and on the battlefield it ends"
stop!! you violated the law!
"wake up screaming, im awake and dreaming, but i wont stop breathing till my heart stops beating"
"fallen, fell to the depths of your regrets and now there's nothing left but apathy, blinded by pride, torn on the inside, count the cost of your arrogance, words pass through deafened ears and now your broken wings mirror your self-regret, why do we live so blind? like a fallen angel's eyes  torn inside, this is the hymn of a broken man"
saxton haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaale!!!!!!!!!!!!
my body is a cage that keeps me from dancing with the one of i love    my mind holds the key
i gave you every guiding word to cut it off! now you hand me back the blade to make that first incision for you!
"i know the light is burning dim and dying in you, i know the pain that lies within â€“ i feel it too  i mourn your blindness  i die along, and swallow darkness  in misery is where i belong! collapsing in on yourself â€“ i donâ€™t know why i try! collapsing in on yourself â€“ i donâ€™t know why you deny!"
"no one can see me and i've lost all feelÂ­ing, i know i wont die alone  i'll stop you from breathÂ­ing and all your deÂ­ceivÂ­ing! ive lost all form and unity, where has my life gone? i'll bring you doom that you can see and bring you down to see you bleed, and evÂ­eryÂ­thing dies look to the skies to see the end of all creÂ­ation again, and noÂ­body cries when evÂ­eryÂ­one dies and no one's alive, bring me 115!"
kill the blind assumption that you know how i react inside! i am not so hollow you can see what grows inside my mind!
so i am locked out of my house for at least 2 hours     anyone know how to pick a lock?
"all this pressure is eating me up inside, and i feel like i'm being buried alive again, all this pressure is tearing me up inside and the fear of failing is on my mind again, the anxiety's building up inside and the thought of losing is running strong again, all these questions are building in my mind, the intensity that surrounds my life has me asking if i'm doing right again, all the memories of me failing life"
"these shackles, they come with certain opportunities, they won't let me get away but they show me we're the same, i can't give in, i won't give in, it's not a state of mind, i'm wretched but i'm powerful and i don't feel like i am real, but i know it's all imaginary  are they real?and do they feel? is all the pain just inside my head?"
i just realized i have no talents!!
i dont just give you my two cents    i whip a roll of quaters at your head!
the cobra that escaped from the zoo in the bronx has its own twitter account! what has this world come to?!
"i can see them everywhere they're all around me, they're waiting for me  descending, un-relenting  beauty of annihilation  your curiosity, feeding off my animosity, and reason is treason  down with all that's good and clean! you can't f***ing annihilate me! bring you down with seven point nine two and no impunity!"
