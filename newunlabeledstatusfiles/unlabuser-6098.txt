happy new year!  it's 1 degree above zero right now   going snow-tubing tomorow at wild mountain and it does not look like it will get any warmer between now and then 
"air temp -16f when we got up this morning   snow tubing canceled   going bowling instead   flying to <propmale> tomorrow   airline called last night, connecting flight canceled   sat on hold for an hour to get rebooked   only flight available leaves 2 1 2 hours earlier   day is not off to a good start "
"i ran in the walk for hope 5k run last saturday   so of course, we got  our first snow the previous evening   never ran a race in below-freezing weather before "
"christmas festivities are over, alas   but as consolation    tomorrow its off to uncle <propmale>'s sci-fi bookstore for the after christmas clearance sale   woo-hoo!"
"for christmas <propfemale> gave me the windows 7 upgrade for my laptop   installed it last night   works great, but should have started the install earlier than 10pm   was up until 3 "
sci-fi bookstore yesterday was great!  bought 12 books   by an odd combination of circumstances only three of them are for me 
we finally went snow-tubing at wild mountain today with the 4-h club   everyone had a blast   then it was off to schoony's in taylors falls for the best pizza and ice cream in the world   life is good 
"today i snapped and gave in to buying a 37\ 1080p hd tv   so unfair of costco to have them all lined up and beaming pretty hd programming at me """
<propfemale> and i went to see young frankenstein at the orpheum last night   it was fantastic!  now i want to watch the movie again 
"happy birthday to me!  hibachi for lunch, browsing a bookstore in the afternoon, pizza for dinner, and playing around with my birthday present (amazon kindle) the rest of the time   what could be better?"
we just got back from camping in duluth  great time! and i installed the facebook app on my blackberry  allows me to waste time more efficiently 
got a new deck being installed out back   must be more careful    went into the backyard after dark and very nearly stepped into a post hole   hopefully by tomorrow evening they'll have posts in them and will no longer be hazards to navigation 
"huge weekend  rode a canoe down coon creek yesterday for the 4-h club stream cleanup  rode for some of it, anyway  we had to get out and <propmale> partway through because the weight of all the trash (4 automobile tires, hunks of sheet metal, etc ) was threatening to sink us  then today, sci-fi sig in the afternoon followed by a trip to bunker beach for the wave pool and lazy river "
"jeez, i finally go into my profile settings after a year or so and fill in all the blanks and everyone goes bananas "
got the day off work and a new blackberry torch   what could be better?
between the sci-fi sig meeting and the 4-h officers' meeting we had twenty guests in the house at one time today   that may be a record 
"update annoyed  <propfemale> informs me that some of the 4-h officers' meeting attendees were\ sorely tempted to crash sci-fi sig when they heard all the <propfemale> trek \sounds coming from upstairs   heh "
"i realized that i have a large number of vacation days that i must use-or-lose by dec 31, so i have taken off every friday through the end of the year   i gloat "
"i think the answer to the burning question \why am i so hungry in the middle of the afternoon\"" is \""because i forgot to eat lunch \""  gonna go do that now """
"had to do a full re-install of the 4-h club webserver   wiped it, installed fedora linux 14, loaded cherokee web server, restored all website files   total downtime    under two and a half hours   a triumph of techno-geekery   i am so proud "
got the day off from work   bwa-ha 
amazon released its top 100 books of 2010   i have actually read one of them   guess my taste in books runs to the unconventional 
<propfirst> got braces on his teeth last thursday   he was only able to eat things like soup and pudding for several days   now today he wolfed down an enormous slice of costco cheese pizza   i pronounce him cured 
just downloaded <propmale> abbott's flatland to my kindle for free   bwa-ha 
personal revelation of the day: attempting to do the weekly grocery shopping three hours before superbowl kickoff = dumb 
ibm's watson just tied for first place on round 1 of jeopardy 
hangin' out at the airport   
"ibm's watson won on jeopardy today, clobbering the grand champions   in all fairness, it did manage to goof up the final jeopardy question     but a win is a win "
ibm's watson won its three day tournament against the all-time jeopardy champions   us humans is obsolete 
"oops, at the airport, not the reserve station "
"<propfemale>'s laptop crashed and burned last night   picked up a used thinkpad at computer revolution to replace it   will spend the next couple hours playing tech-support-guy, getting it all set up "
"fri march 4th - first friday feast @ 6pm, first friday @ 7pm "
"oops, posted that to the wrong <propfemale> "
i think it was when <propfemale> was two and <propfirst> was an infant that i finally gave in to the truth: poo is everywhere 
"just got back from the mensa rg   spent the weekend having entertaining conversations, meeting a sci-fi author, learning about mushrooms, participating in a sing-along (no, really!), getting outbid at a silent auction, being clobbered in a sudoku tournament, and tripling my caloric intake   what a blast!"
"broke out the yardstick last night because <propfirst> seems to have gotten just impossibly tall   turns out he has grown nearly an inch and a half in the last few months    translates into about 1 16 of an inch per week   i took altogether too much pleasure in informing <propfemale> that, at this rate, he will pass her up before his next birthday "
"called the post office this morning to get the requirements of height, position, etc  for putting up my new mailbox   based on what they told me, everyone else on my block did it wrong "
