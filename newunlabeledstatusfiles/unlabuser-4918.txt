"1 if i erase these thoughts of the past, would my life be as long? for everything left undone i want to start over again "
"2a i should be chasing the never-ending dream, following the path, i trip over people in the crowd  thinking back as i look up at the sky without reason, i wonder what it's like to go back  understanding you is hard, because when you sacrifice, you're the only one that's sad  your sins aren't shed as easily as tears, they remain your burden to <propfemale>  you can't find a way out of this emotional maze,"
2b so who are you waiting for?
"3 writing in my white notebook, i remain loyal with what i say, but why, when the dream world seems so real? to bestow the fight, to become alive, i scream for that, can you hear my cries? safety is nothing, because i can't return to that place "
"4 i was thankful when it was kind as well as strong (i'm on the way) i've come to miss you, such a pain is welcome too "
"i'm turning 32 tomorrow   all i want is to be able to dream like everyone else does   since i can't have that, i'll settle for time with all my kids, cheesecake, & whichever friends choose to visit   a tank of gas wouldn't hurt either   smile "
so my soon to be ex wife is making threats again   
"it's 9 smile 0am, i got less than 4 hours sleep, i need caffeine & nicotine   a few more hous & i get to see <propfemale>   who's bringing over the cheesecake?"
"it was great seeing the kids   hurts to let <propfemale> go again   but it was great singing with her again   thanks to those of you who called   & the rest, i understand you have lives unlike me "
so i'm out of texts until the 15th i think  at least now i can stress out while figuring out how to destress relax enough to sleep 
"so we make an agreement & then she denies it   she picks a fight over her actions & company & how that reflects on her   & i'm the bad guy for being worried  *sigh* done, washing my hands of it "
"\flat on my back out at sea hoping these waves don't cover me i'm turned and tossed upon the waves when the darkness comes i feel the grave but i still believe\"""""
"*<propfemale> sigh* why can't peop<propfemale> understand, leave me alone for a day, means more than 10 mins?  & why should i trust them when they have a history of lying to me? the most recent event of which was 16 hours prior?"
"so after extorting me continusly  regarding my clothing, my possesions, & letting me sleep at night, she's now threating to cut of my phone service because i've asked her repeatibly to leave me alone for a day since all she wants to do is fight   *sigh* where do i find these people?"
why won't she ever leave me alone? i'm done being played with 
so   who wants to babysit tonight?
"i'm done with people who insist on depending on alcolholics, stoners, & to take care of our kids "
tomorrow     *sigh*
"so today    it's been 19 years today   i'm surrounded by family, but feeling alone  all because one person betrayed me, i feel like i've slipped back, & i all i can do is hide how bad it hurts   it's been 19 years today since i lost my mother   &a part of me is still that lost 13 year old boy "
i don't want to be alone anymore    i want it all to stop falling apart around me   
baby mama drama  the other one this time  *sigh*
"anyone in ep, tx have a spare microusb cable (not miniusb)?"
"the e playful ression \the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"" does not mean i get to bid on the contract """
