"worked with my dad to paint the door jams around the closet and three other doors for six and a half hours   as we were getting ready to leave i knocked over a gallon of blue paint and it went all over my floor and my purple closet walls   spilling a gallon of paint is crazy overwhelming, but we did get it cleaned up!!!"
"rode <propmale> for less than 20 minutes when she decided she couldn't exist without <propfirst>   it was like a switch went off   she was so pumped i almost couldn't get off her   after free lunging until she was soaked, hand walking to cool her out then blowing her dry, she was still pumped   she continued to be wired until <propfirst> and she were both in for at least 15-20 minutes   she hasn't been like that in a long time "
"<propmale> was somewhat rideable today, but she is soooooo in season and only has eyes for <propfirst>   wolf was in the arena with us, but that did not seem to do the trick "

"saw a fox sitting on the side of waters road  he was beautiful! he had a dark black nose and a dark black tipped tail  i passed him, slowly backed up, then watched him for at least five minutes  he would twirl in circles, put his nose in the air, then open and shut his mouth  after about five minutes of this, he trotted off down the road then into the woods "
"is struggling with the new facebook layout   first, i couldn't find the logout   now i really want to know where my lists groups buttons are for newsfeed   i can't find them   breaking it into my lists allows me to see a lot of people that don't ususally come up   uggghh!"
