i have finally found a picture worthy of putting on my profile    smile 
just got back from dinner and the longhorn basketball game with my husband   had a great time!  we did our part in the big12 pac10 challenge by beating usc (despite poor free throw shooting)   now we are 6-0   very very excited about this season!
"may not have been pretty, but it's a win!  go horns!  big 12 champs and on our way to the national title game!!!"
lets see how honest fb friends are  leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me  it can only be 1 word  no more than 1 word  then copy & paste this post on your wall so i can leave a word about you  this should be interesting   
"just got back from dinner and the longhorn basketball game with my husband   we had a fantastic evening!!!  so much fun!  love winning!  we beat michigan state and are now 11-0   i have no voice left and probably won't for a couple of days, but it's a small price to pay!  woohoo!  hook 'em horns!!!!!"
when did i become a ma'am?  it must have happened when i wasn't looking!
is in the hospital   she was admitted for diffficulty breathing which is dangerous for someone like her who has chf   she should only be in for a few days   please include her in your prayers   thanks     <propfirst> ware
"is home from the hospital!  hallelujah!  still recovering from what was apparently pneumonia and complications to my chf, but i am feeling so much better than i was!  thank you to everyone for your kind thoughts, wishes, and prayers   i feel very well-loved   it is much appreciated   i will be trying to catch up with everyone (and of course my games) over the next few days   just very grateful to be home!"
trying to walk through life with grace and dignity can be a real bitch!
"whose gonna love you when your looks are gone?  god will, like he waters the flowers on your windowsill   <propfirst> <propmale>"
"it took all the love and tolerance i could summon not to go to jail tonight for assault - i seriously wanted to kick the drunk in front of me at the game in the head - hard   don't turn around and tell me that i might as well not get so excited, if the longhorns keep playing like this they will lose anyway   while that may have been true - what kind of fan is that   people like that don't deserve tickets to games "
"ok, normally i wouldn't do this, but in honor of <propfirst>'s day (which i don't even celebrate) - here is a picture of me and my husband <propfirst>   we have been married for 4 years now (9 04 05)   happy <propfirst>'s day to everyone out there!   smile "
for my mafia:  my cousin <propfemale> trejo just started playing the game and needs some more mafia members   please add her (just be sure to include mafia in the friend request)   thanks!!
"happy st <propfirst>'s day, especially to my familia and all my other <propfemale> peeps out there   i'm ready - i have green toenail polish on and everything   to any of my drinking friends - have a couple for me!  everyone enjoy the day however you choose, but be sure to stay safe!  maybe i'll even dance a jig!   smile "
feeling nostalgic   
apparently grocery shopping with a heart condition is not quite as easy as i would like to think   i really intensely dislike this whole limitation thing 
"i'm thinking about getting a tattoo for my upcoming birthday, probably around the ankle or on the top of the foot   i'm looking for ideas on what to get   please don't mention butterflies, flowers, hearts, barbwire, etc   i'm just not that kind of girl    laugh "
"i have been offline une playful ectedly for the last couple of days, so i am way behind on posts, games, gifts, etc   i will try to catch up as quickly as possible    smile "

"i don't ever send out <propfemale> suggestions, so if you get one from me, ignore it   looks like there is something new traveling around fb "
"sorry i have not been feeling well, so i haven't been on at all in a couple of days   feeling very overwhelmed at the moment with trying to catch up   hopefully, will be back up to speed soon    surprise )"
"finally    i am back online   sorry, but i have been offline for about 3 months now   i will try to catch up as quickly as possible, but it is a bit overwhelming   i will be returning messages, etc   sorry if i miss anything   just holler     thanks     btw, very happy happy to be back online      surprise )"
i really hate it when god feels it is necessary to use a 2x4 on me to get the point across   lol  amazing opportunity to be of service today!   surprise )
"my sister just left for home    sad   but we had a fantastic time during her visit   took her to the ufc event last night, both her and my first, which was an absolute blast!  i'm so glad she came for a visit   i miss her already "

"please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay  my prayer is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice; people who are gay are not looking for a cure, but acceptance & equal rights  and, please pray for, and help our at risk youth!! peace & hugs"
"my poor boy <propmale> has been sick as a   well you know    dog   emergency visit to the vet yesterday   he is feeling better now though   between that and not feeling too great myself, i have missed a lot of posts the last couple of days   sorry for anything i missed   hope everyone out there in virtual world is doing well "

"<--- is sick in bed, will be back online and catching up with everyone as soon as she feels better    this was written by her husband <propfirst> ware"
"today's rant - i have noticed something lately in college and pro football that greatly disturbs me   supposed fans booing their own team players   just my opinion, but a true fan should never boo their own team   the point of being a fan is to support the team   unless you get your fatass off the bleachers couch and can throw, run, block, or tackle better than the players on the field, shut your freakin' piehole!!"
my mafia - i am collecting uniforms again   i need all 3 varieties and will return the gifts sent to me as always   thanks!

"3 16-a couple of significant anniversaries occurred in the last week, not necessarily the good kind, and i was totally unaware of them until today  this is only possible because i am generally at peace with the past now  this was not an easy process - it took a lot of work and some definite assistance from god  however, i am so thankful today for that peace - the past does not have the power over me that it once did "
the dogs are trying to tell me it's nap time   be back later    surprise )
"3 19 - i was feeling a little low today, but i am thankful that i know that feelings are only temporary   also, a lot of fear creeping in   however, i am grateful that i have been taught what to do when fear crops up   first prayer, and then turn my thoughts to others   glad i remembered to do that today "

"3 21 - the emotional turmoil of the last couple of days has led to a nice mini-catharsis   although i am exhausted, i am grateful   i have some work to do and i am going to use this to propel me into action and more action   i am thankful today that my god is bigger than any box i might try to fit him her it into "
"3 23 - a lot to be thankful for today   i have a lot more energy than usual   been jamming and dancing around the house this afternoon after the dr appt, playing with the doggies   beautiful day - sunshine is such a pick-me-up   we're grilling tonight for the first time of spring   can't wait to sink my teeth in   i was able to continue the more action i started the other day   truckin' along!"

"3 25- it may sound strange, but today i am thankful for language  i had bits of poetry running through my head today (usually it's music in my head, but occasionally this happens)  language allows us to communicate so much more fully with each other  language can be used for self-e playful ression, but also to connect with others  words can be used in profound ways to change the world and the people in it "

"3 27 - more grilling tonight, some work around the house, a trip to home depot for house stuff  (excited that we are going to work on the front yard)  but what i am most thankful for is the talk i had with my good friend sponsor  it's amazing how much clarity can come from that even though i don't understand how it works so well  from aggravated to not in no time  she always helps put things into perspective    smile "
