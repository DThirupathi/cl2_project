"do you neglect your life? neglect yourself? are you content to live with failure or pray for something else? i am your regret, your sense of loss, your abandonment emotionless life, resist temptation to reach out won't be your saviour to smash your doubts i am your abandonment, refuse the urge to bleed out i am not your fucking hope"
"so you wanna play games with my head?\\fuck you, make me fall apart, i wish that i was dead\\i just can't believe i fell, for such a blackened heart\\you played me for a fool and used me from the start\if i tear you open wide, take a look inside\\are you pretty?\best bfmv song ever - pretty on the outside"
