"truth has a life of its own  \p s  i had a great time at wimter jam!!!"
"if you feel yourself floundering in the sea of life, try leaning back and floating \let yourself be supported  gaze into the beautiful sky and allow time for your spirit to be refreshed  then when you are feeling stronger, simply choose a direction and start swimming "
"storms may be raging around you, but you can still find peace in your own heart because the god of peace reigns within you "
