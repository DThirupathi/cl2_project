is beginning to think that having e playful ectations for other people is overated

"has nothing but homework to do for the rest of the week, so not to be mean   please don't bother me "

"is wondering if good things happen to good people, why do they usually get screwed over by the people they help?"
"is working on mid term papers and projects all this week, that will hopefully be done by sunday  who needs sleep lol"
"someone please tell me why in hell would bravo have a show for the next great <propmale>ist, don't they know that true <propmale> stands the test of time  great <propmale> is not a trend!"

is going to be busy for the next few weeks doing final exam stuff  so if there is no response now you know why  smile 
is learning how to say no to people  not every good deed is appreciated let alone noticed 
is starting to think maybe itâ€™s better not to care   no e playful ectations means no disappointments

had the best day ever and has made up her mind about a great oppurtunity  smile 
is enjoying her last week of summer vacation  smile 
is loving the start to her weekend before school starts next week  smile 
can look back now and honestly say i am proud of myself for never losing sight of what's important and excited about where i'm heading in life 
"first week back to school was actually pretty good and a lot of fun, hope the rest of the quater is like this  smile "
wonders if if its weird to love the harderest class i have this quater  smile 
i am bored out of mind in psychology class   why am i paying money for this class?!
3 days of school + 4 days of work = 1 week of fun!
"i am currently doing a survey for my product design class and i need everyone who is 20-40 years old, that has a dog(s) to message me, please "
"i am currently doing a survey for my product design class and i need everyone who is 18-40 years old, that has a dog(s) to message me, please"
"wants to thank everyone who completed the survey, it was appreciated very much  smile "
is sooo ready for another vacation  smile 
"a full day of classes and work, means that i'm going to sleep well  smile "
day two of trying to sleep in has failed miserably 
is in class watching this depressing ass movie in the dark 
i can't believe that in less than six months i'll be twenty! damn where did the time go?
woders if it's bad to want everything you ever wished for all at once?
"i'm so ready for fall break, only three more weeks and counting  smile "
is on cloud nine right now  smile 
"maybe i'm wrong but, the world could definitely use some more common sense and common curiosity "
"people should stop and think   \if i treated you the way you treat me would you like it?\"""""
"i'm so glad that i graduated from phs, setting here at my little brother's open house just reminds me how annoying it was "
is trying something new   more me and less you 
life isn't complicated people make it that way 
is watching the episode of <propmale> & <propfirst> when they went to <propfirst>   smile 
hates being sick  sad 
is feeling a little better but her voice is still gone  sad 
is getting ready for a busy week   honestly there should be more hours in the day to sleep 
hates how people try your <propfemale> when you barely have any left 
"people are so quick to speak but, so slow to listen "
breathe then relax and think   it'll come to you eventually  it just takes time 
doesn't wanna get up out of bed
"today feels like a \me\"" day   peace of mind here i come """
a day of work then homework   typical sunday 
there's no better feeling than being sick the week of midterms and having to work   yay  annoyed 
i'm not trying to live up to your standards   i already have my own 
it's not that i forgot about you it's just you never mattered 
it's just one of those days
it's the challenges that you overcome that make you appreciate life more  and for the ones that you cannotâ€¦simply test your resilience 
is at home trying to be studious before all hell breaks loose this weekend  wink 
"looking through the sales paper with the family, planning on what stores to shop at on black friday! i love my thanksgivings  smile "
it's always nice to know that you can come home and be put at ease after a really long day 
can't believe finals are almost here 
there's no great feeling than the sense of accomplishment 
so over this quarter 
anything in life worth having never comes easily 
"the heart will want what it wants, despite all logic "
"just finished opening all my presents at my moms, time to go back to sleep  <propfemale> christmas"
finally having a me day!
itâ€™s ironic how others perceive you as naÃ¯ve for giving someone the benefit of the doubt  then again not everyone deserves that luxury 
better and bigger things on the horizon 
finally made my new years resolution: to go outside my norm 
"loving life even more at the moment, with so much to be excited about  smile "
life has been presenting me with one great opportunity after another  i know this year is going to be an amazing one!
this first week of 2011 has been an amazing one  i can't remember the last time i have been this excited new year   better times   better me 
at the end of the day it all comes down to your ability to see past the facade of those around you to determine their true intentions 
i thank god for giving me the grace and strength to handle all obstacles 
your sadly mistaken if you think what you have is what i want  i already have something better 
the people you surround yourself with reflect the person that you are 
today was just one of those days when everything just clicked   no more mediocrity in my life 
maturity is not something that comes along with age but rather your ability to learn from your life e playful eriences and grow from that to become a better person 
"i hate being at school all day, especially when i don't feel well "
i'm on cloud nine right now; all my hard work is finally starting to pay off 
"thank you everyone for taking the time out yesterday to wish me a happy birthday, i really do apreciate it  smile "
"never say things that you have no intention of doing, it's just a waste of time "
"finished with all my midterm exams, now i'm off to enjoy the rest of my weekend  smile "
can't wait for co 
hate being sick especially around finals 
this week is going to be a very good week 
finals this week so please don't ask for favors 
"one final exam done, only four more to go "
"four exams done, only one more left "
finally off from work and starting to enjoy my spring break   to bad it ends so soon 
there's nothing like a two mile jog to ease the mind 
"be careful of what you wish for, because you may not like the end result "
the wisdom one gains from their maturity does not come from age but rather their ability to learn from their life e playful eriences 
i'm going to make the best of my day today no matter what  smile 
i love being a daddy's girl  smile 
today is just one of those days 
"since everyone wants to celebrate bin laden's death, how about we start by lowering gas prices   just a suggestion "
