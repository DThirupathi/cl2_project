might have strep throat  worst possible time to be contagious
let's sing together! we got <propfemale> dripping through our veins now baby!
two finals down and one impossibly-easy-to-study-for open book final to go  hot diggity damn!!!
"i wonder what kind of person i would be if i wasn't considered funny by some people? probably annoying, and i wouldn't have awesome friends         i know that sounded really cheezy there at the end, but i'm serious  i would suck if it weren't for my personality"
wants to party hardy
"went to see avatar, and my mind was officially blown  not what i was e playful ecting, but that is one of the best movies both visually and vocally i have ever seen!"
