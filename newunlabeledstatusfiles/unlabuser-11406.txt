i think tomorrow would be a good day to go shoot some stuff 
closing a half an hour late is one thing  walking into a bathroom that smells like urine and rotten vagina is just a slap in the face 
aah  three days off 
"\do you want me to hold it like i did before or should i just let it dangle\"" - funniest thing i have heard over the radio at work in awhile """
if you can't read and you don't know how to use a map you really should just stay home 
"if you have a bumper sticker that says \if you don't like my driving call 1-800-2fkn-bad\"" you really shouldn't be driving  especially if you don't know how to change lanes without almost causing an accident """
i don't want to see any more people for at least 3 days 
brrr
i thought people in this town only did laundry on the first of the month? must be the time change 
people need to work on their shopping cart etiquette 
i saw <propfemale> clause today  smile   totally made up for finding a cockroach in one of the washers at the laundry mat 
done with all my finals  now to figure out what i'm going to do with my 3 1 2 weeks off 
three a's and one a-  yay me 
"half this stupid town blows their welfare checks at the liquor store, and i get denied unemployment cause i'm in school and can't work full time  nice "
oh my god  it's like a blizzard out there  i better get to kroger before they're out of bread  i don't know what i would do if there was more than 2 inches of snow on the ground and i didn't have at least three loaves of bread
"yes  please sit next to me and talk on your cell phone loud enough for the whole damn room to hear you  if you could also eat while you are talking that would be greatly appreciated  no, i wasn't trying to concentrate on what i was reading, please continue "
should i or shouldn't i go to school tomorrow?
please shut the (insert e playful letive here) up  you are in a public place and not every one in the (here) room want to here your stupid (and here) conversation about how much you paid for a piece of paper 
thank you everyone
