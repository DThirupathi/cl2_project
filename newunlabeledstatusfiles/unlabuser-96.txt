i wish americans would do their homework instead of believing everything the media spoon feeds them   
"just because i don't agree with what a lot of you are saying    does not mean the i wouldn't defend to the death your right to say it  that's what makes <propfemale> great  the freedom to say what we want even thought it may not be popular or widely accepted  i may not be a <propfemale> any more    but i still believe that we all deserve to be free to say, think, and worship how what we want "

"so, here is the final standings on the mears kids at the fair;\<propfirst>: grand champion - breed; reserve <propmale> champion showmanship in her class, and blue ribbons for all her events\michelle: special award from judge due to difficult attitude of her goat; blue ribbons for all of her events, and her goat took second to <propfirst>'s grand champion in breed \all in all not bad for my kid's first time showing    holla!"
"sometimes i just want to copy someone else's status, word for word, and see if they notice"
crop dusting in wal-mart    oh yeah!

"yes, the <propfemale> pigs fly at midnight - but do not listen to them, they speak only lies and treachery "
"okay, so <propfemale> and i just finished season 2 of fringe and i am completely disappointed in the plot twist of the switched olivias  from a show that has stayed away from cliche plot twists for so long why drop the ball now? so, i am ready to boycott this season unless someone can give me a good reason to keep watching or let me know how many episodes until the olivias are back to where they belong "
~discontent~
just watched this season of fringe's season premier (dvr thanx) and is officially boycotting fringe until the writers can pull their heads out of their back sides and fix this stupid <propfemale> twist  my wife is still into the show so she will keep me appraised of any pertinent information pertaining to the primary plot while i am on my stupid writer sabbatical 
"had a great time visiting with my friends <propmale> ben-zekry and <propfemale> ben-zekry, then came home and was disgusted with fringe season premier but have a wonderful wife <propfemale> clum mears, who understands my madness and is willing to tolerate my intolerance for substandard television "

"for anyone who was wondering, <propmale> & cheese with bacon is amazing  i recomend it to anyone looking for a quick heart attack, it's a good think <propfirst> knows cpr  he had to revive me twice during the meal "
