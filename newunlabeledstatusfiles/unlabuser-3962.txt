headache from hell    waiting fo tylenol to kick in so i can sleep
enjoyed an awesome fireworks show from the vantage point of san <propfirst> with my love
"playing doc again, trying to diagnose a few select things, figuring out medical puzzles, and trying to keep my future wife comforted and calm about the wedding day"
<freakin' tired  going to take a nap    zzzzzz      
kicking back and relaxing with my wife after our big day  laugh

"faith and i went yesterday to see paranormal activity  if you don't believe in ghosts and otherworldly beings, you will after that movie  was doing good to up until the end where i almost pissed my pants  lol"
"anyone ever wonder why everything seems to go bad all at once? taking over a leadership position going just on what you've seen without a turnover, fighting a spiritual battle, and wondering if you're gonna deploy is taking a <propmale> morale hit     sad "
"well, faith and i are taking a breather after getting the butterball turkey in the oven, so i thought i'd take a moment and say something about her cooking     it's amazing!!!!! might not have leftovers if the turkey turns out like the pecan and pumpkin pies she made  smile "
"just got back from <propmale> air force base at the northern tip of the island  went camping there last night, made some smores, pitched tents, and fell asleep in the treeline about 40 ft from the ocean  best sleep i've had in months"
happy new year's ya'll!
ocd cleaning spree!!!!!!
"faith just left for the airport    her flight is co627, so please, send your thoughts and prayers with her and bring her safely home "
"so, faith is just now taking off  plan is 5 minutes behind schedule "

watching and waiting    
faith's plane just touched down in hawaii  3hr 10m layover 
"faith's plane just left the terminal and is taxiing out to the runway, 3 minutes ahead of schedule  next stop, <propfirst> islands!"
down to the home stretch  faith's flight leaves the <propfirst> islands at 02:40 this morning and arrives in guam at 04 smile 5  almost home   
almost time   
leaving for the airport  it'll take about 30 minutes to get there  see you guys when we get back
hating my job at the moment  i've never worked with a group that pisses me off so much    
slightly better day with more ass chewing and less back talking from my guys
dreading today and the day hasn't even started yet
nothing like getting called by your boss with him telling you that he can't get in touch with two of your co-workers    bad juju   especially in the military
"the movies were fun  went to go and see shutter island  not gonna ruin the story, but the plot was one of the best constructed and confusing storyline i've seen in a long time  smile "
"just got a price quote for 4 new tires for the car   e playful ensive, but definately a good price for labor, tires, realignment, and disposal of the old tires, at $320 96"
pondering the thought of quantum data processing    
time for bed  can't wait until the baby shower tomorrow  love you hon!
"right now, it's 0156 in guam, and i'm watching our soon while faith sleeps a bit  three things i've learned about babies in the last two days: one- they love to eat and sleep  two-the binkie is your best friend when they get fussy  three- no matter who's baby it is, they've all cute when they sleep  smile "
keep this up and i'll set a guiness world record    10 hours of sleep in 5 days   
"before, i used to run on energy drinks, but it appears coffee has become my new motivator of choice"
"<propfirst> lohan who? i can't believe the news coverage being given to a spoiled 20-something yr old  here are a few 20 yr-olds worth knowing about: <propfirst> <propfirst> 23, <propfirst> linley 29, <propmale> weikert 29, justus bartelt 27, <propmale> <propfirst> 21, <propmale> <propmale> 21, <propfirst> <propmale> 26, <propmale>hew <propmale> 23, <propfirst> goeke 23, & <propmale> tate 27  these 20-somethings gave their lives for you this week  repost if you support the military "
contemplating the complexities of life and the various webs the three fates weave with their twine of <propfemale>   
it's been one hell of a week    can't wait for this shit to be over with   
"my wife made some awesome chili for dinner  it was delicious! love you, hon!"
"a u s  military member is somewhere in the world tonight missing their family while you are safe at home  in the minute it takes you to read this, military members all over the world are not only saving lives, but they are also sacrificing their own life for your freedom  it's military appreciation week  repost if you    are in   the military, love a military member, or appreciate our troops"
yay!!!! duty is almost over and i can go home and sleep!!!!!!
"usnh guam, i am showing my support for hn henson chiong  until my shipmate come home i will have his photo as my profile picture  get well chiong copy to your profile and change your pic to show your support!"
"a politician sees his family everyday, a deployed soldier once in 6 months  a politician flies 1st class, a soldier flies in a c130  a politician's pension is not reduced, a soldier's is clawed 65%  a politician enjoys an e playful ense account, a soldier must justify extra rations  a politician vows to defend their country      a soldier actually keeps that promise  repost if you support our troops "
"you and i wake up in jail together    using only 4 words what do you say tome? note: if you comment, you must copy and paste this in your status so i can comment on yours  fair is fair    play along copy & repost"
"i've spent the latter half of my life so far, wanting and wishing to be numb from emotion  when i saw my wife get on the plane this morning, it hit me like a freight train: those emotions are what make us different from machines and psychopaths  those emotions mean that it's not just words like some people think  those emotions are what people human "
just started a cleaning frenzy
sleeping
sympathetic illnesses    quite the paradox that <propfirst> and i get sick at the same time with the same symptoms   
going to the store for formula  call the cell phone if you need me 
"damned wisdom teeth    er did a digital block on my jaw, but that worse off about 10 minutes ago  got percocet with tylenol 5 350 for breakthrough pain, so at least there's something for pain control that won't leave me loopie until i get them extracted"
"the wife is having trouble sleeping without being here  hopefully, the hypnosis over the net that we attempted will lull he to sleep for a while "
"remember, this christmas, while you are eating your dinners and laughing, that in another house there is an empty chair where a hero should be sitting  they gave their life so that you can sit with your family  so light a candle this christmas for our fallen heroes that did not make it back    and for those still serving in iraq, afghanistan, or elsewhere  repost this as your status to show your respect    ooorah!"
"got bored since <propfirst> is asleep, same things are on tv, so i made cinnamon loaded carrots, some buttery cream corn, and broccoli and cheddar smothered rice  delicious!  smile "
afk
afk
drilled a makeshift shelf into the wall in the cat's room  compared to what i've seen before and what i have at my disposal   looks horrible     sad  definately wouldn't sell that to people   
"great    fever of 101 3  this happens every time i go on leave, i'm never taking leave again!"
"bacon, egg, and cheese mcgriddle = kick-ass!"
wishing i could eviscerate some people that show injustice to others   
"i guess that old saying is true  you are who you <propfemale> out with  can't believe what i'm hearing, and it's breaking me to pieces having to swallow every bit of it "
"   hating duty right about now  get here, and half of my keys aren't working for what i need to do my duty     i go on leave, and everything fucking falls apart! what the fuck!?!?!?!      annoyed igh:"
"sitting at the computer at work after admitting a patient, now watching red vs blue  i'm happy this computer can stream media  smile "
duty   day two   and why in the hell do you make one phone call to admit 3 patients?!?!?! not to mention that in was two hours after the first one was supposed to be admitted!  annoyed igh: guess that's why they post times with the <propfirst> on the pagers    ohh rah military   
hoping to chill and relax a bit with faith before work tomorrow  looking forward to a relaxing evening   smile 
reflective thinking   and more so than usual
watching and waiting    that's definitely the worst part of it
"   i've never felt so isolated and alone before  feels like my entire existence is collapsing around me, but i'm powerless to control the flow of things  autonomic execution is a callous creature within itself, yet flawless and perfect in design   "
wishing the day would be over with already     24hr duty sucks   especially when those people on the <propmale>s don't do their damn jobs by telling you that someone just transfered from one <propmale> to another! grrr! frustration!
nothing like watching and waiting for a shift to end   the anticipation is a killer!
