isn't it funny how life seems to be giving you a break now and then only for you to end up one day worse off than you were before?
"even though i think life seems to enjoy making things complicated for people at the worst times  i also think it always remembers to leave one, small good thing for you get through it all even though it's hard to see  i dunno maybe i have too much time to think about stuff like this  what do you think?"
i think it's funny how music can drive me better than anything i know
