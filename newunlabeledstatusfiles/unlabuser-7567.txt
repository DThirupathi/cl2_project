i get to start the new year at wal mart so it goes without saying i am less then thrilled

one of these days i will be strong enough
"childrenwith special needs don't have an illness, so there is no cure and it's not contagious  they want what we all want, to be accepted  most of you probably won't copy and paste this  could you do it and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour? it's special education week"
quitting you has never been easy and i lose strength to do it everyday

"my car cleaned out and washed, check  my sister's car cleaned out and washed, check  my dad's house clean, check  my sister's apartment clean, check  laundry started, check  can't wait to sit around and do nothing but watch football tomorrow now   smile "
all the kings horses and all the kings men couldn't put my heart back together again

how do you convince someone to stay when all they want to do is go or better yet how do you let go of all the selfish reasons and be selfless by letting them go?

i do not want to be afraid
waiting at the airport is no fun!
