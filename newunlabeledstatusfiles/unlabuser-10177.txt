"to non pet owners who visit our homes and complain about our pets  1)they live here; you don't  2) if you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the furniture  that's why they call it 'fur'-niture   3) i love my pet more than i like some people  4)to you, they are animals; to me   they are my kids, who are short, hairy, walk on all fours & don't talk back! re-post if you love your pet "
"just got back from the oral surgeon  had all four wisdom teeth removed  not in any discomfort (yet), just waiting for the numbness to go away and the bleeding to stop "
"ready for warmer weather to get here  i'm done with the cold and snow  i had my white christmas <propfemale> and christmas, so the cold and snow can go away  also wishing that life wasn't so dang complicated so i can figure it out "
wishing all the snow and everything would go away and that i was able to go out and do something   sad
