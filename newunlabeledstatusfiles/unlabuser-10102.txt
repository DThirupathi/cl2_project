i hate being insecure  i need insecure  ok well at first that wasn't a joke but then i noticed that it could be  but the opening statement still stands 
started kingdom hearts 2 i am now confused
ok i'm not the kind of person to join groups i find it a little idiotic  but every now and then a worthy group pops up  and this is by far one of them  the real reason we're in iraq is to catch rare pokemon!
is vaguely interested in someone 
stupid water using sitar son of a bitch boss  i love videogames 
just beat the first form of kingdom hearts 2 final boss  probably like five more to go  also epic equals guy with long silver hair in black robe things doing a backflip off of a skyskraper and then wipping out two red lightsaber things in midair and diving head first towards you  i got wet a little when i saw it 
a scattered memory that's like a far off dream                            a far off dream that's like a scattered memory                                      i want to connect the pieces                                           yours and mine 
all i feel is hatred 
the maximum characters available for a status update is 420
someone posted on my wall and it made me happy  because it never happens
don't you ever think twice  it's alright 
almost 100% on kingdom hearts 2 just the annoying bits left
is about to dive into the past  this will be weird
so reading through my myspace messages from freshman year is giving me a creepy weird bad feeling  making me remember things too  like when i went to the soccer tryout and saw all the people trying out and instead of going and trying i hid and cried because i was convinced i would fail 
"i wrote this on myspace 4 years ago \in the beggining there was a lot of fucking  a whole fucking lot of fucking  no i dont think you get it were trying to make a fucking race here we fucked the shit out of anything that moved  people fucking other people  people fucking trees i mean this was some serious fucking fucking  and thats how the world came to be a whole fucking lot of fucking\"""""

"in august 2002, abkco records reissued beggars banquet (rolling stones) this release corrected an important flaw in the original album  due to an error in the mastering, beggars banquet was heard for over thirty years at a slower speed than it was recorded  this had the effect of altering not only the tempo of each song, but the song's key as well  this version is about 30 seconds shorter than the original release "
the stones were too fucked up to notice that their own album was out of key  lol
my grandpa died today  he was a funny guy  r i p

"this will sound like i'm seeking attention  and i guess maybe i am in some ways, but that doesn't diminish the truth behind it  i find a cold comfort in hurting myself  and i've been doing that quite a bit lately  i deserve it though "
it feels nice to hurt the person you hate more than anything else but then it feels bad because it's yourself  i don't deserve better though  i want to die  i wish i could die  i keep trying to gather the courage to never have to feel anything ever again

i have trouble vocalizing my thoughts feelings emotions  i never know how to say anything 
is pretty sick of just ending up being a problem 
is also having a low blood sugar and wondering if i should even do anything about it this time
i hate it when i have the whole fucking www in front of me and i have no idea what to do with it 
let's get to the point 
they say that teenagers say that teenagers scare the living shit out of me 
i'm in a really bad mood and i might say some insensitive things and the truth is i really hope whatever i say hurts you right now and i hope it hurts a lot  i might not feel this way later and most likely i won't even mean what i say now  i aim to cause pain  because sometimes all i want is to blow up the outside world 
my blood sugar is 446  it's probably a good thing that i don't care that i'm slowly killing myself 
why is facebook telling me to adopt a fucking sea turtle  i don't care about some stupid seaturtle that doesn't even exist  i'm not going to put a smile on a digital sea turtle 
this <propfemale> chick set a music download record  i might shoot myself right now 
my mom is probably the stupidest person i've ever been around  it's a shame there would be nothing to be gained from her death 
read the lines  after that  look under the surface  you can never be sure i'm saying what i'm saying because you just might not understand what i mean 
but i alone am the one you don't know you need to keep for your ego make me blind when your eyes close sink when you get close tie me to the bed post
<propmale> is furious 
"i'm a circle incomplete, i'm a heart that barely beats  all the memories stay forever as tattoos i'm a <propfemale> without a sky  i'm hello with no goodbye  i'm the dreams we had that never will come true  that's me with no you"
oh the irony 
life is odd 
i see how it is  (stares pointedly)
too many mutha'uckers uckin with my shhhh
need to put my mind somewhere else 
holding it together  smiling  but i don't mean it  not yet  i'm slipping 
i have an amazing talent of making absolutely everyone in my vicinity miserable  i win 
how the fuck now brown cow  because i give up 
i think a good friend of mine has been telling me to listen to keane  <propfirst> kentopp  i think  anyway  i love them 
"sometimes it's hard to know where i stand, it's hard to know where i am, well maybe it's a puzzle i don't understand  sometimes i get the feeling that i'm stranded in the wrong time where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme, a soundbite"
"cause love is an inkless pen  it's a tavern, it's sin  it's a horrible way to begin"
"i did a sick, sick thing to my love  my lack of loyalty, it swallowed her up  and she cooks me food  she squirmed and turned like a skeleton key  she left her man unattended to me  don't call me that  don't claim you love me cause you know that ain't true "
and when we kissed  it didnt feel poisonous and when you cried  i dried off your blue eyes she smiles at me as she is falling asleep  says we've gotta live the best we know how to
very few bands have a cd where there is only a single song that i'm only vaugely unsure about  if i like the whole cd that's an accomplishment  this band wins

i don't function well with humans  i need more aliens around 
i'm just really pissed off at the moment  so if anyone wants to do anything and make me feel better that would be cool 
i don't want politeness to get in the way of honesty  say what you mean  i value information over my own feelings  if it's true then it's not rude it's honest 
drugs are fun  smile
