i'm suffering from a serious lack of motivation    
at the doctor with <propfirst>   he fell and split his lip open inside and out   i don't think he's going to enjoy his first stitches   
i'm jealous that <propfirst> is so much tougher than me   he's running around with a big stitched up gash on his face and he doesn't even slow down    smile
