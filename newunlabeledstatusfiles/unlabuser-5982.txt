"i pray your <propfemale> shines\through this doubting heart of mine\so my world would know that,\you are my strength"
things will always turn out  being patient is key  but above all god 
i miss my a c ts  family sad 
"if only my life was back to age 6, and i never cried when i fell but stood up and looked for more "
i have a profound <propfemale> for peace  and discovered again that it is not in the abstract but in the concrete that we must love  in the concrete love is not sentiment but challenging a practical matter 
not even my headache can ruin my day smile 
being sick blows sad 
and then i see all of you and there is no more pain smile   (((a c t s  family)))
"you give me strength when all i could do is face the ground,let the fire burn deep in my heart and soul love "

what happens now  
"i know that you could break my branch in two, but i have roots stretched in the earth that will withstand wind and fire"
"i know you hate to see me cry\\one day you will set all things right\when my world is shaking,\heaven stands\\when my heart is breaking \\i never leave your hands"
