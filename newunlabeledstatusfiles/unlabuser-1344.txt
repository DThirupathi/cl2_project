"there comes a time in life, when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it  you surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, and focus on the good  so, love the people who treat you right, pray for the ones who don't  life is too short to be anything but happy  falling down is a part of life, getting back up is living~repost it if you agree, i did!"
i hate t-mobile   *angry face*my phone is f*%king up    uuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh
ok now part of this question comes from a friends page if you knew that someone is most likely not a good match for you would you still date them and have the e playful erience and lessons learned or would you pass on it and never know but to that question if you have been going after what you think is a good match for you and it has not worked out wouldn't it be better to try something different so tell me what ya'll think
