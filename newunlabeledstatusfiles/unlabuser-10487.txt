had a weird dream last night     one the ones where i know it was a dream because i woke in my bed but am still having difficulty separating it from reality  funny part is i don't remember it all 
is not wanting to do house shit today
pictures on my mind    think i may finally post summer trip pics
back in town for a few days
"i'm tired     shoulda slept last night    oh well, off to pay bills and such "
i think the one thing i dislike about living in town is there are so few nights i can see the stars   
going to the doctor this afternoon to check out this bug spider? bite on the back of my head      sad  it's not getting better    but am gonna feel stupid if it's nothing 
"sick of cleaning    man, i need a party night "
getting my clean laundry together     gotta air out my house then put it back together  stupid bug guy    hopefully bugs all die

ugh ate too much ice cream   
"one box 3 4 done going through    seriously did my mom have to file away every piece of paperwork she ever got for school, work, etc for the last 20 years?!?"
about every 30 pages give or take i find something i have to keep though so not a complete waste of time 
on the other hand i wish i knew i could just chunk the whole boxes out lmao
ugh    i dont get migraines often but this one is killer    anyone needs to get a hold of me    well i'm putting the phones on silent  deal with it 
"so sore today    on the other hand, at least i know i put in a fair amount of work "
"dude, self realization is very interesting sometimes "
it's beautiful morning outside    the clouds are pink the sky is blue and the <propfemale> is out and as bright as if it were 2am 
"1 more month and i'll be a year older, a little less mature than last year, and saving a bundle on car insurance  laugh "
is feeling very tired today    i leave town tomorrow so tonight i wish you all a <propfemale> christmas and many blessings  enjoy time with your family and friends as much as you can  don't take them for granted 
will life always be the way it is? or does it get better?
"ok for anyone who cares my car is dead     sad  for the near future that means i am not going anywhere that is a considerable distance from my home  should be back up and running with a month or two, one way or another "
