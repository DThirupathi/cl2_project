"terrible mood  i don't know why  maybe its the sleep deprivation? i don't know, but i don't like it "
"i am honestly getting really tired of all the drama that is involed in high school, its like even though im not involved in it, it just makes me mad to see  people really need to grow up and stop being so immature about such little things "
ah another week of school is about to start and we are so close to the end of the year  im so happy to be so close but sad because i won't get to see my bestest friends ever like every day of the week d: ill just have to <propfemale> out with them a whole lot during the summer!
"hooray! i am completely finished with every bit of homework for this year of highschool, im prolly going to pass 4 5 of my classes and there is only two easy finals and a half day of school ahead of me! and then i get to whine to all my friends about my boring'ish summer lol!"
hmmm part way back into summer and i'm already really bored  i've been trying to entertain myself with doing a ton of stuff around the house and other things to get my dad to finnaly get me texting  so hopefuly before long i will have that and maybe a new phone and be able to actually talk to most of my friends  fun fun lol! thats summer for ya!

blah blah blah summer is blah  atleast i'll have a fun weekend  going to the rodeo in molalla with my sister and my dad tomorrow and then going to (hopefully) go up to washinton sometime to pick up mega-super-awesome fireworks to set off on the 4th when we get home 
i've run out of things to hold my mind's attention  i'm now going crazy for real 
feelin pretty good about life now since yesterday but now today i has not a thing to do!
hooray stayed up all night because i couldn't sleep! so yes  for some reason i thought i would let you all know 
went to see inception with my sister and my dad  it was a great movie! not the easiest story to understand though 
time seems to pass so fast for me when i have things to do and people to talk to  speaking ofcourse about my summer camp that i just got done with yesterday  got to see alot of my old friends but that week seemed to go by in just an hour  not enough time  annoyed   but hooray my 16th birthday is in 17 days! hoping to go play paintball but who knows if that will work out 
my ipod is very dead now  hoping to get enough money from my birthday to get a new ipod touch
hooray my birthday in two days going to go play laser tag! hoping to see some of my friends from school on registration day  smile  then just a few short days later school starts again! both excited for and dreading that moment   
"had a great birthday party  got to play three games of laser tag but on the second game we played against a bunch of little kids and lost horribly  oh well, all they did was follow us around and shoot us anyways  smile "
"classes   \modern us history with hagen\astronomy with mitchell\chemistry a with mcelhaney\english junior honors a with vickers (woot!)\geometry a with aerts"
figured out how to get my computer to act as a wireless hotspot for my new ipod touch so now i can text everyone with yahoo and do email and all that cool stuff with my ipod  smile  all my friends should message me their numberz if they wanna talk
went to see <propfirst> pilgrim vs the world today with my best childhood and right now friend and it was a good movie  kinda like one big acid trip though lol  going camping tomorrow for the next four days so that will be fun  can't wait to see everyone at school on the 31st
this camping trip that i'm still on has turned out to be the worst days of my life so far and i still have one more day to get through    sigh what a great vacation before school starts with my dads family  sad 
school today now i'm up wondering what time the bus is going to be here    who knowz lol
done with the first week of school and i got my internet fixed finally so yeah  geometry and honors english homework to do but with a three day weekend it won't be very hard  smile 
things so far are going really good this year  going to take drivers <propmale> starting the 20th  i like all my classes  hooray school is not that bad any more!
i'm really mad  my dad seems to have written the check too late for drivers <propmale> and if a spot doesn't open up by tomorrow     i'm screwed  no driving for another year most likely unless dad suddenly decides he wants to take me driving at all  sad  not cool 
was kinda mad yesterday about the whole drivers <propmale> thing but it's all okay now  got in and its all taken care of
first day of drivers <propmale> and well    it was horribly boring  knew all the stuff we went over and it is three hours long so    yeah at least i got signed up for the behind the seat driving  with <propfirst> of course!
drivers <propmale> tomorrow with three hours of semi entertainment and then my first behind the wheel session on tuesday  i'm really nervous for that so yeah  i hope it goes well!
"wow lol good day today, i got a new phone, unlimited texting, and i'm in a good mood! text me so i can get your numbers~ 503-267-8505"
"well my weekend was one of the best of my life  new phone, fun time, pizza, talked to friends, talked to that special someone a lot, and went driving for about 2 hours   smile  good time "
absolutely horrifically miserably tired  stupid mondays   
i am emotionally drained  such a stressful day    funny how happy things turn bad so fast  i would go more in depth but it wouldn't turn out well i think 
went on a pretty cool beach trip-drive-thingy with my friend <propfirst> that only involved like a hour total of being out of the car  it was still fun though 
"i'm getting tired of hearing these stories of people making up shit and lying about relationship and such  just basically to all my friends, don't lie when it comes to peoples feelings  all you will do by being dishonest is fuck things up  honesty= <propfirst>'s #1 value "
"i also don't understand why cussing is such a frowned upon thing  its a collection of letters that make a sound that we interpret as language  who cares what fuck means or sounds like    i'm sure if i tried i could come up with much \worse\"" things to describe the same concept  think about it people """
"to the peeps commenting about religion be careful about what you say  they have a right to believe what they want  it is only taken too far when they judge others outside of their belief  the same goes for people who do not believe in god  do not judge them because of their religion  your just a hypocrite if you do so, which makes you a liar "
"okay so off of the evilness of the world and our weird hypocrites, i'm getting my hair cut sometime next weekend  anyone got any ideas? its gonna be semi long but a hell of a lot shorter than now  think me freshman year minus the chubby and the retarded hair but the same length "
discovered i can't do backwards figure eights in a car  damn you <propfirst>  but thanks for the intense talk about that club idea thingy  we should act on it 
"why can't water boil faster? geez stupid water  i want my macaroni now! haircut hopefully tomorrow  who knows though, dad changes his mind a lot "
"bleh suddenly depressed  sad  who knows why though, life is pretty good right now  just cleaned my whole room for no reason and dusted everything in here    reeks of the nasty incense my dad's cousin burns downstairs    i don't like her very much anymore    she has over-stayed her welcome "
"(continuation of previous status)  i'm all for giving people places to stay when they need it but really, \go get a fucking job and get out of my basement please  i don't care if \your back is all messed up and your liver looks like a river rock, \that's your fault  you even said it would be temporary "
"new haircut, i feel like a new person! hooray for growing up and all its awesomeness  don't like how i look? too bad  smile  cause i don't care what you think!"
"hah wow just saw the new shake weight commercial on tv    if you thought the one for women looked suggestive, the one for men is even worse  he says stuff that even makes it worse  \ooh yep that's it\"" rofl priceless """
tonight was amazing    i had a great time and i got like a bazillion complements on my new haircut  thanks everyone for making my life better in some little way  smile  or a big way    you know who you are 
"school tomorrow, not that much going on    homework after school then 3 hours of <propmale>ucational drivers <propmale>  i get up at 5 smile 0    and go to sleep on weeknights around 11    so thats a really long day o o oh new thought! our school ne<propmale>s to change its hours  we would learn much better starting at nine or ten in the morning as oppos<propmale> to 7 smile 0  hey molalla high school, grow a brain please so we can grow ours "
"people people people    tired good day  driving was fun for me but not so much my partner  more of it tomorrow, just on the highway  it will be okay though  smile  homework is done and i'm feelin pretty good about life "
got into a bad mood after english today  talking and watching stuff about linching and racism against humans with black colored skin  fuck that is so stupid  sorry if i took out my anger towards humanity on you today 
"had a pretty good day with <propfirst> today  beat her at pool once, but then i lost at air hokey like five times  hokey    that word just doesn't look right  anyways looking forward to school tomorrow because i get to see my special someone  smile "
"hah who would have known that this day would bring a <propmale> life style change for me  i'm selling all of my video games and such    to my friends who are borrowing some of them, sorry but no give-aways  i need money for what i'm planning  but of course because your my friends, you get a discount  talk to me if your interested and we will talk prices "
you are all just jealous of how amazing my life really isn't  hah  almost tricked you there  tired  stressed  wonderful  makes me feel alive  and sick  ew 
"suddenly feeling sickly and shakey and not good ): i do not want to go to school tomorrow  but alas, drivers <propmale> must be attend<propmale>  i will just have to suffer "
mood right now? huge  droopy  frowny face  d:
uhg  insane loneliness  this sucks 
three english papers in one night  well    one was revised but    it wasn't that hard  i'm proud of myself  and i'm feeling pretty good about life  hooray!
what happens if it snows over night like a ton? will molalla cancel finals? doubt it but i still want snow 
i miss my friends  bleh  i can't wait to be back to a populated place  i can't say the word though because that would be stupid 
"ich mÃ¶chte wirklich nicht zu driver's <propmale> morgen gehen, weil es montag ist, und wir sollen auf den tag haben  schrauben sie frau duckworth  arschloch  why did i make this <propmale>? cause i felt like it "
drivers <propmale> is done with finally  my mondays can be full of sleeping now!! sweet sweet sleep 
"people that i promised myself would not get on my nerves are getting on my nerves  why would people make decisions that make their life a lie and just generally shitty when the easiest path is the right one  cut the bullshit  be selfish sometimes  you need what you want sometimes  if you don't want what you have, change it please before i go crazy  or at least make a move to change it "

"got a big fat xmas tree  it smells good and it is drying out in the shop  we will prolly put it up on tuesday  by we i mean me by myself because there isn't any way the troll is touching my tree  and dad works so, it will be fun to try and figure out "
listening to angry music getting all pumped up for xmas  this is the way to live 
"(part one)my educational life is bothering me  i don't want to be in public highschool  there are too many stupid people and stupid teachers alike  i want to go to ooi  i just want to be finished with this place and move on to a nice college, meet new people, have fun, and most of all, control my own fucking education  because it is now obvious to me that i really do not have any control over it "
(part two)this  is  fucking  crazy  forced to learn what i will never again use  atleast provide me with something that can get me the same credit for but do something different or apply it differently  and make the teachers actually teach  because some don't  fire those ones 
"(part three)because they are a disgrace to teachers who actually do their job well  because i'm not gonna learn from you assigning me homework i have no clue how to do  idiots  this has been <propfirst>'s rant for the evening  and facebook, you suck for limiting my posts to 420 characters  fuck you too "

"sudden social depression, sudden urge to hurry up and get to xmas  sudden burst of joy from the holidays  sudden sadness that it doesn't make me as happy  sudden happiness that i was with the person i love today  end result? a little bit happier then normal  fuck "

"crap  every person  always pre-conceived notions that are false  it always turns out the way i don't want it to  its always depressing  it would always be better if you didn't do this  it's not going to be better for me if you do  i'm sorry, but i think your wrong "
"sleep, why do you avoid me so eagerly when i must be up in three hours? fucking asshole  looks like tis an all nighter for <propfirst>  pray to whatever god you believe in that i make it through the day "

"please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons  dragons are nearly unstoppable, and in case you didn't know, they can breathe fire  93% of people won't copy and paste this, because they have already been eaten by dragons  6% of people are sitting in the shower, armed with fire extinguishers  the remaining 1% are awesome, and will re-post this  will you?"
i hate when you want to tell someone something but you require them to ask you about it before you can 
i am writing a story using symbols for creative writing  it is a very serious and saddening issue i am using symbolism to comment on  someone gets eaten by a t-rex  good stuff 
i wonder how people describe me in conversations when they don't know me 
got it all printed  now to mount it  har-har-har 
its alive! and its ugly!

"if there was a god, why would it take sides? wouldn't it want to preserve the natural way of things? why pray? if god was real, it wouldn't help you  if it did, it would be like you were cheating at life  therefor i conclude that god does not exist, and strike this debate forever from my mind  not that it was much of an issue before "
you know its a good day when your throat and mouth hurts by the end 
"well lets see  can't sleep, feel like shit and school tomorrow  fuck "
"uh wow  stupid  dad leaves for the whole weekend, leaves me a note to clean everything in the house, and doesn't tell me where he is going  also mentions that i can't leave the house or have anyone over  there go my fucking plans, thanks dad  your always there when i need something messed up "
