"why does life have to be so messed up?   how do i fill out the parent section on a fafsa form when my parents aren't legally seperated, but haven't lived together in 15 years? and there's no spot on there to e playful lain but i don't want to get into trouble "

"so who really knows everybody on our fb friend list? here's a task for you    i want all my fb friends to post how you met me  after you comment, copy this to your status  you'll be amazed at the responses you get   this might be interesting \(p s: i don't e playful ect everyone to respond to this, i just thought it'd be interesting to see who does respond  so if you'd rather not, it's okay, don't worry about it)"
"frustrated   i guess i'll type up my speech now  hopefully that'll help me feel better, but i don't think so "

"it's too early in the day to be doing geneology  sad  had to trace back our family tree through voice messages, then made my own family trees in microsoft word by inserting rectangles one by one, but it took waaaay too long "
talk about a long day  
wow  someone just let out a blood curdling scream in the parking lot (ends up they were just goofing around with friends) and it gave me a <propmale> chill plus nearly scared me straight out of my seat lol

"so  i was feeling hungry and took a few small pieces of jerky out of an opened yet sealed bag, popped them into my mouth, and didn't realize until i started to swallow that all of the jerky in the bag was covered completely in white mold  there wasn't even a spot that looked like jerky should look like "

"message me a number, 1-500, and i'll tell you what i think of you in my status -- this could get ugly    can you handle the truth?\\haha stole this from will =p"
"#13: we have known eachother litteraly since birth (19th anniversary coming up in a few weeks) and have gone from dating, to best friends, to siblings in the course of the last 5 years  although we've had our up days and our down, words can't describe how much you mean to me  so with that in mind i must say, \bi lusr\"" """
"#4: i must say, you have the most awesome laugh i've ever heard  times spent together at bible club and camp are memories that i <propfemale>  you are a remarkable woman and a wonderful mother and i regret that we don't talk as much as we used to  sad "
"#56 our relationship is a slightly complicated one, but i'm so thankful to have you in my life  long ago i feared you, but now i love you more than i can say  you have such a caring heart and i thank god everyday for the woman that you are  never give up hope "
"#7: you always manage to make me smile inside, even if i'm not smiling openly and you have such a positive, upbeat attitude  thank you for all of your help and encouragement "
i can't put into words how good it feels to finally have come to terms with the past 
"#21: i have so much respect for you, as my sister in general and because you know what you want, and you stick by what you believe  you were there for me in the good times and the bad especially in these past 4 months  i love you and i only wish i could be as strong as you are "
"#80: for having only met you a few months ago, you've already become an important part of my life  there are so many things about you that you claim i don't know, and maybe i don't know them specifically, but there is nothing that could make you any less special to me than you are  you tug my heartstrings more often than most people do, but for that i thank you, because at the same time you've helped me live again "
"#31: it's hard for me to describe you  on the one hand, you're a great friend and it makes me glad to hear from you, but on the other hand you lead me on for awhile and don't always take no for an answer "
"#72: how can i describe you accurately when there are so many things i could say? you are wonderful beyond compare  you always make me smile, always make me life, and seeing your name on my updates always makes me happy  smile  you are like another brother that i was meant to have, but by some mistake didn't end up biologically  i'm thankful for who you are, and i love you bunches  smile   love "
"#99: you my friend, are the boss  we may have met years ago in a bizarre way, but you made such an impact on my life when i needed you most  thank you for listening to me rant all those times and for picking up the pieces after every heartbreak "
"i don't know how, but i managed to get a 3 769 gpa  smile "
i find it strange how something as little as an earache can hurt you so much 
i think i have *finally* concocted something too spicy for even me to eat   
\so turn around you're not too far\,cc65bbd7104bb51ea4ff7997d332a311,"??????????????? ?? ? ?? ???????????????\? if you have an amazing sister, put this as your status ?\??????????????? ?? ? ?? ???????????????\i'm one of the lucky ones; i don't have one amazing sister, i have several  smile "

"i have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour  think of someone you know or love who has had cancer  my wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found  will you please post it for 1 hour? there are too many to mention who fought and are fighting  i hope to see this in the status of all my    friends \~i am posting this for my grandpa, and my aunt <propfemale> in particular!~"
