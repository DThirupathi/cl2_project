"i just looked up the difference between bum and drifter on wikipedia    just a cool piece of information, really "
i love having tuesdays to do homework and nothing
"my mind is in overdrive    there is depth and meaning and organization to every little instance in daily life  it is incredible and beautiful  so much to see, and so much depth to it all    on a deep level, the only study is the study of psychology and how thoughts change reality    i can't write everything down  you have to read my journal to understand  sad "
"woohoo, a whole day devoted to homework   "
"two exams today, i must admit i'm kinda nervous  not as nervous as i was for the spanish exam, though    "
i knew they were gonna bash that car at the pep rally tonight!
"i watched idiocracy today  i think its the best movie i've seen in a long time  it has alot of themes, but my favorite theme can also be e playful ressed in korn's music video \evolution \"" real writers don't just try to make a living  real writers are trying to save humanity   """
<propfemale> and i just keep running    i just hope i don't meet her fate as well

"i can't wait to go home, and then to indianapolis! today was an extraordinary day, probably because it was crammed with homework and i get a rush from that sense of accomplishment "
badass no rehearsal today! i'm thrilled to have a free afternoon!
i'm home again! but dammit i gotta get going tomorrow morning    time is so precious!
"we're in the motel6 in springfield, missouri  the trip so far actually felt shorter than it was  all i can say is that i miss the ol' six string    and my beautiful bass  there are so many tabs i would play if i had one or the other  i'll suffice to look up the tabs and save them, though   "
"we're finally in indianapolis  we stopped in st  <propfirst> and saw the arch, if you can't tell already haha  we got some really great photos, and our hotel is nice, so i'm happy and enjoying the city!"
"haha so much for my short stay in indianapolis! i'll leave tomorrow to go back home, and hopefully not suffer as much for the hellacious long drive i'll have to take back to las cruces    i can't wait to see my brother play, and hopefully i'll get to play with their band!"
"well, i'm on my way back home for the rest of the week    hello airplane flight!"

"free fuckin' korn concert!!!!! hell yes! i've never been so excited in my life! on a different note: i've decided what i want to do with my college career  i will be a dual <propmale> (or a <propmale> and a minor) in psychology with a slant towards statistics, and either a <propmale> or a minor in accounting, depending on how much time i have  life is great! text me if you wanna talk!"
"i hate not having gas money, i'm so pissed about missing the concert   "
one more assignment    damn! its funny how so many people don't consider survival and continued existence when they look at the world  thinking that way helps to see what is really important in life   
"black coffee, facebook, and the wednesday paper    what a great morning "
"\bad news never has a good timing    but i know the heart of life is good \"" -<propfirst> mayer  never was a more perfect time in my life for this line   """
"<propmale> tarantino's pulp fiction is an incredibly good movie  great acting with <propfirst> l  <propmale>, <propfirst> travolta, and <propmale> <propmale>  incredible outlook on society, especially through the eyes of underground gangster <propmale> winnfield (<propfirst> l  <propmale>) as he finds divine intervention in his life and inspiration to turn all the violence in his life around   "

"the quest for quarters was successful  i am now finishing my laundry, thank you <propfirst> "
i'm far ahead on my homework and i'm very happy to have the evening off!
"well it looks like psychology and accounting dual <propmale> isn't going to work unless i have six years to complete it, and so i'll be taking a psychology <propmale> with a minor in counselling and educational psychology  however, my viewing the wider world classes will be accounting and probably business administration "
"awesome  next semester all of my classes start later than 8 smile 0 and are done by 2 smile 0 any day, but on friday i have one class in the morning and that's it  it's 17 credit hours but it doesn't look like that much, thank goodness"

man i found the right side of the bed to wake up on today! what an awesome day!
i'm covered in grease after spending all day under a pickup  i just want another cigarette and for this stupid slide show to be finished   
"my coffee would be more enjoyable if my room didn't smell like an automotive student's room, with my power steering pump sitting on my desk   "
i love having days with no class  just scraping together the last bits of homework before the break!
i'm home!
"black ops is one fun game  i particularly enjoy that they put a zombies game mode on it  i'm also glad that the perks made online play alot more even  no more stopping power or commando, and the quicker ads doesn't work on sniper rifles by the definition of the perk  the campaign is kicking my ass, but its very good, and very suspensful  i would give it 4 5 or just maybe 5 stars "
"just got back to cruces with my family, and i'm ready to march at a game tomorrow!"
"pretty thrilled, there is only one class that i'm not sure i'll have an a in"
i've discovered that repairing my truck (yay success!) has given me a new fondness of it  i wonder if it is that way for anybody else?
they say the pen is mightier than the sword but damn! i'd hate to have a pen in a swordfight!

confused?!?!
woooooooooooo!!! i'm fairly certain i got all a's this semester!
"that <propfemale> pride keeps me singing, even in regret and miserable defeat     \we're still screaming at the wailing wall!\"""""
"today i learned the nature of intelligence, from a philosophical standpoint, revisiting aldous huxley's brave new world  but more importantly, i learned that even throughout everything the human mind can contemplate, all there is to living life is - - - living life "
"(continued) even if there is fate and a cause for everything, we would have no way of knowing or understanding it  ultimately, to find a definition or a reason for the une playful lainable odds that something does occur is in itself contradictory and self defeating "
"(continued, <propfemale> 3) a person cannot understand understanding or define existence using anything in existence, just like you can't define the function of a shovel using any physical part of the shovel, or understand why you understand the existence of the shovel "
"(continued, <propfemale> 4) to understand existence goes beyond rules, ideas, assumptions, observances, and everything we as humans can understand  it doesn't matter if god does or does not exist  what matters is how the idea of god affects our existence, and that is why i say all there is to living life is living life "
burnout    not much going on today
"6-19 well here goes  you may not read this, but i hope you happen to see it  you changed my life  you taught me how to accept the past and look to the future as a stronger person  you taught me to respect feelings as well as thoughts  you taught me that life doesn't have to be a series of accomplishments  i miss you still, and think about you every day  much love! -<propfirst> vandiver"
hell of a hunt yesterday  i'm so sore!
"well, i've decided to try again to restore my '59 ford  budget is tight with college, time is short with a job, and its snowing outside! what an uphill battle!"
"\how we survive is what makes us who we are \"" such a great line  i wonder if people realize to what extent this is true?"""
"i have concluded that <propfemale> is falling apart, and the best way to survive is through less use of oil products and decentralization  we use more resources than our nation can produce, and that is the basis of our debt  <propfemale>ns will have to learn to live smaller and relay less on credit, and find better ways of making use of local resources  buying hometown goods as oppose to walmart is a great idea "
one long trip ahead  at least i'll get there before dark
living is the study of life 
i wish i could shred the guitar like <propfirst> garcia   
"life is like a doctor's needle  if you try to anticipate it and tense up, it only hurts "
first day of class is great! i got lost but i found my class and my teacher is pretty hot haha!
i hate when college people do really high school things  grow up and welcome to the real world 
"excited for psych 310, this class is gonna be awesome! once again i'm reminded of why i am a psychology <propmale> "
"cannot wait to get an apartment  hiking today was very enjoyable, really wish i took a camera   "
woo all a's! things are looking good! summa come laude here i come!
"having a greater understanding of life has helped me to feel content with my own, with the security of knowing how take life's changes and challenges with an open mind and a lack of frustration  this is peace for me "
"i am not afraid to fight for my love, but not having the <propmale> is true heartbreak   "
i am so beat today    ugh
"great day in spanish class today, almost makes me excited to do my stinkin' homework!"
second day of no school due to limited power from the snow (in las cruces!) and it was like the other day when i won in texas hold'em with four 7's  that don't just happen!
"man what a holiday haha! candle light, live guitar, apartment, poker and friends    and like i told my mom, no intention of leaving haha! the weather keeps me thinking about existence and survival and keeping life basic  never is a better time for a good conversation about deep things like career plans and life e playful eriences  life continues with fresh meaning, and we reap new fruits of our e playful eriences!"
"i'm quite sure i would live a happier life if \monday\"" did not exist """

"strange: it seems people like to beg for change at walgreens  i have never been asked for change at all in this town except for two people at walgreens, on separate days  weird!"
"well, murabak finally stepped down  iÂ´m happy for the people of egypt, the only thing is, power now rests with the military and the idea of corruption creates some frightening possibilities   "

never eat cold pizza   
can't wait to go camping this weekend! its gonna be the best trip ever!
"back from camping, sorry if i missed any calls  however, it was one of the most memorable weekends of my life, with no doubt!"
"strange week, i could swear it was 30 hours shorter than a normal week    however, we've got a band started, sounding hella good, and a possible gig in two weeks? so band practice is almost a mandatory everyday thing haha! college is great!"
health care was never the problem  the prescription drug industry is the problem  it's so screwed up that they can turn a huge profit from everybody unfortunate enough to have a condition or illness   
"it was so awesome to be reminded of how <propfemale> i am yesterday  flogging <propfemale> was playing, and it was so familiar i could sing along  the first time i tried shepherd's pie i loved it, and all i was missing was suspenders  wonderful st  <propfirst>'s day!"
