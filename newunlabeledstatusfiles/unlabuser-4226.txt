"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, live far away, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, what you drive, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people  your conversations pick up where they left off, even if they have been months apart  they love you for who you are  repost if you have at least one true friend "
"i'm not supersuperstitious, but this year july has 5 fridays, 5 saturdays and 5 sundays  this happens once every 823 years  this is called money bags  so copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days  based on chinese feng shui  the one who does not copy,    will be without money  i can't let that person be me! what the    heck- it cant hurt"
"i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of <propfemale>, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under god, indivisible, with <propfemale> and justice for all!! i grew up reciting this every morning in school  we no longer do that for fear of offending someone !! let's see how many <propfemale>ns will re-post this & not care about offending someone! god bless <propfemale>"
"if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best \ \",563a7bcd2dc50d05d0e32f310a8ff2bc,"there comes a time in life, when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it  you surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, and focus on the good  so, love the people who treat you right  forget about the ones who don't  life is too short to be anything but happy  re-post if you agree"
"asking if everyone could please put this as your facebook status for 1hr: for those who have (or have had) cancer, we pray that a cure will be found in 2011 ?"
"your son will hold your hand for only alittle while,but will hold your heart for a lifetime  its son's week  if you have a son,who makes your life worth living by just being around,and your proud of your son,copy and paste to your status    "
"three hrs at the dr, 1 hr getting a stat ultrasound on my leg that has been swollen & numb for over 2 wks now and still no answers   grrrr!!! go back to dr next fri for all the good it does  and oh yeah and my hair is still falling out giving me bald spots from stress but do you think my dr gave me anything for it?? nope   what's the point in waiting to see him?????"
"do you ever look at some people and just think damn, why didn't their momma just swallow?"
grrrr   why does life have to be so complicated?? (sigh)
"it takes so much energy to <propfemale> around hatred and then it eats at you  let it go  forgiveness doesn't always mean accepting that person back into your life as they were, sometimes it simply means that you acknowledge that we are all human and therefore make mistakes  let it go, and if necessary, let them go; find peace in the resolution that they no longer hold a place in your life "
"a boy writes a letter to\god  \dear god"," why do you let bad things happen in our schools?\"" god replied \""\"563a7bcd2dc50d05d0e32f310a8ff2bc,"dear god,\my prayer for 2011 is for a fat bank account & a thin body  please don't mix these up like last year \amen"
"don't lose hope  when you are down to nothing, god is up to something  keep your faith strong! ?"
"goin out to dinner to celebrate my <propfemale>'s b-day! yay, finally a couple hrs of it being just the two of us!! (much needed & well deserved)    smile "
went out & had a nice dinner without the kids for a change  was actually a lil relaxing  now my leg is just throbbing! another dr appt fri then more testing next week  wish they would just find the prob & fix it  ugh!
"this week we remember babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never met, or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that came home but didn't stay  make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby the majority won't do it, because unlike cancer, baby loss is still a taboo subject  break the silence  in memory of all lost angels"
"words are full of power!!! they can heal, they can wound, encourage, discourage  people get divorces over words, families are split, build insecurity and poor self image over words that have been spoken to them  we need to choose our words very carefully  all we have in this life is our words! communication is key  watch what you say  be careful with what comes out of our mouth "
"remember, life is balance  you'll never know how great it can be, unless you know how bad it can get "
"   love me for me, not for who you want me to be, cuz in the end    i'm still just me!"
"-- welcome to my wall  today's specials are: lack of sleep, up too early, and low on patience  thank you, come again --"
"look out mid michigan, the big one is suppose to be coming tomorrow afternoon evening is the start of 10 to 12 inches of snow    ugh!!!"
"hello fb family & friends! been out of the loop for a few days  just laying around with my leg propped in <propmale> pain, yay me   sad  anyway had ct scan yesterday, they seem to think its something neurological with my back causing the problems  going back to my pain mgmt dr next week  man, i hope she can at least ease some of this pain! hope all is well with everyone else!!"
"it's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship  these types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don't hold grudges  they understand that life is busy  but you will always love them  re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends, they will know who they are!"
"ok  i have to say that half time show was awesome!! i think it may be the best one i have seen yet   that was totally \beast\"" (as <propfirst> says) !! now ready for the 2nd half    """

"??????????????? ????? ???????????????\?if you miss someone that's in heaven, put this as your status!?\??????????????? ????? ???????????????"
"a normal person has 1,000 wishes  a <propfemale> only has one, to come home safe  i know 97% of you won't post this as your status, but the 3% that do are my friends  in honor of someone that died, a wounded warrior or who is fighting for your freedom, please repost in their honor  *****as always, brother you are in our thoughts and prayers!  we love you--- please be safe!! *****"
thank-you soooo much for all the birthday wishes everyone!! lots of luv to you all for thinking of me!  smile 
"yesterday was probably 1 of the worst b-days ever  to start with we all woke up late,drovethe boys to school an hr late  then had to make my appt  w my pain mgmt dr  only to find out my ct scan revealed a slipped disc in the lower lumbar region of my back  then i had to get an epidural steroid injection with two enormous needles! that is how the day started & just got worse from there  hope today goes way better!!"
"the boys are doing the webelo scouts camping this weekend  pinewood derby was this morning,eric came in 4th & was bummed he didnt place for a trophy but <propmale> entered the family race & took 2nd with the other car  they were both happy with the 2nd place trophy! then they got to spend the afternoon sledding,ice fishing & who knows what else? 1 more peaceful night kid free while they are doing activities they enjoy!  smile "
the boys made it home from their camping weekend in good spirits  learned a few new things & <propfirst> earned quite a few new badges-he is very proud of that fact! it was nice to have the quiet time but i love having them back home!! i dont know what to do without them  i'm thinkin a good ole fashion family sunday dinner for a nice ending to the weekend   smile 
"my mom has made me laugh, wiped my tears, hugged me tight, watched me succeed, saw me fall, cheered me on, kept me going strong, and drove me a little crazy at times  but moms are a promise from god that you will have a friend forever! put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful mom whom you love  ? i love you mom!!!!!!!!!!"
wishing to get out of this rut  bring on summer!!
"so  jacob got into another fight this afternoon  according to all the kids around he \won\"" this one  i guess it's just in the kimbrell blood (sigh)   can't wait for these boys to grow out of this! <propfirst> & <propfirst> eventually did so i know there is a light at the end of the tunnel but it doesnt seem to be getting here quick enough!"""
"<propmale> had his solo ensemble tonight, he did okay on his solo piece, earned the silver medal for that performance  but the quartet could have went better,they still brought home the bronze medal tho  practice or lack there of was the key-what kid dont like to beat on a percussion <propfemale>? 4yrs in band and 3yrs on percussion, he is good but he could be so much better if he would just practice more  grrr!"
"ok so i'm not wanting to complain (well maybe a lil)  what the heck happened to all my friends?? no one calls, txts, emails, even a snail mail letter would excite me right about now,lol  i know i have been sick most of the winter,maybe not very socialable but i miss my close friends & besties!! (you know who you are) i'm feelin soooo unloved  sad "
"<propfirst> sheen 47, is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict  while <propfirst> wilfahrt 31, <propfirst> tabada 21, <propmale> hizon 22, chauncy mays 25 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention  honor them by re-posting this status pray for our troops!!"
"hey! unkind persons! your behavior is not very nice! picketing fallen soldiers' funerals    yeah, i'm talking to you! do you know why you are allowed to do that? because the dead soldier you are disrespecting gave his or her life so you would have the freedom to e playful ress your stupidity! i reposted this because i wasn't afraid to e playful ress my undying gratitude to every single service person past, present and future "
"made mistakes, sometimes more than i like to admit, being a mom  but i will always be there for you, to hear you, to cheer you, to laugh or cry with you, to protect you with my life, to sometimes tell you things you don't want to hear and to love you for eternity with all my heart  no one will ever love you more than i do, i'm your mom! repost if you have children, young or adult, that will always be in your heart!"
"we took <propfirst> to see rango last night for getting a's & b's on his report card  as well as good behavior for the marking period  it was a cute movie and he had a great time! good job,son & i'm sooo glad you enjoyed the movie!  smile "
"so we attended <propfirst>'s parent teacher conference & she had nothing put praise for him! it was actually a student led conference with a powerpoint he put together--very impressive!! i have dabbled here & there w  powerpoint but my 5th grader seems to have it mastered  wow, blows my mind the things our kids are being taught these days!! amazing    "
"god saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be  so he put his arms around you and he whispered come to me  with tearful eyes i watched you, and saw you pass away  although i loved you dearly, i couldn't make you stay  a <propfemale> heart stopped beating, hard working hands at rest  god broke my heart to prove to me, he only takes the best  put this on your status if there is someone in heaven you miss every day "
the girl you just called fat? she has been starving herself  the boy you just called stupid? he has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night  the girl you just called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her  the boy you just tripped? he is abused enough at home  there's a lot more to people than you think  if you're against bullying you may want to post this 
need to get motivated & get ready for work   (yawn)    hope everyone has a great day!!
"tired,tired,tired   tryin to get the boy's in bed but they keep trying to delay the inevitable  think they are hopin for a snow day tomorrow but they are going to bed whether they have school or not! ready for some peace & quiet   "

"there comes a time in your life when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it  you surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, focus on the good  so love the people who treat you right, pray for the ones who don't  life is too short to be anything but happy  falling down is a part of life, getting back up is living "
