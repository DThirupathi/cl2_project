"i find it amazing and hilarious that without hippies, new age stuff, heavy drugs like acid, lsd and the likes there would be no apple computers, no organic food movement and a buncha other ish prevalent today (especially concerning electronics ) even more amusing is that these burn out hippies are the captains of industry  oh what, oh what i pray thee tell am i doing wrong?"
ok heres something i bet ya didnt know  the father of the modern computer (something turling) died by suicide (eating a poisoned apple) cause he was gay and the boys arrested him (bigots) and tried to chemically castrate him with female hormones  so is that why apple had a rainbow colored apple with a bite in it as the logo? or does it have something to do with <propmale> and his apple? or <propfirst> and his apple incident?
"whoa whoa whoa, my last updates got me looking too smart  music people say thats not good for the image soooooo ummmm lemme see  im bout to get it crunk, twist up the finest <propmale>, blah blah blah, go clubbing     slaying with no rubbers    buy out the bar    designer clothes and uhhhhh eff them nukkas over there   no not the ones over here but those guys over there   yea, them"
"just finished another track, sorta like it, gotta wait til i get it back to see how much i'll really like it though    im impatient "
"guess i'll take some time off from music to get my nerd on and play dragon age 2  a well deserved break, its hard on me to remain witty, comical and creative all the time    no really you're brain literally burns potassium for clear thinking therefore im prolly burnin mine up at a much higher rate  (another useless fact provided by yours truly)"
"but no matter how many fish in the sea\it'd be so empty, without me"

"im the last guy to keep the wise guys code alive   if i can't live by my word then i'd much rather die   no no don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched   i'm cut from a different cloth, i'm just who the shoe fits"
"alittle late but i finally watched that <propfirst> sheen interview and homies far from crazy  a victim of his lifestyle, maybe  crazy, definately not  apparently wearing meat dresses makes you some sort of deep genius where as partying with your wealth makes you crazy? word? lol dont let the media start telling you whats right or wrong"
i really really hope it isnt true but rip nate dogg   i'll head out and pour alittle out for ya
"now all i need is an image to go with the name baby  wife beaters and white t-shirts, hanes mainly  its a long shot but is it possible?  theres a <propfirst> maybe  if not he's gonna have to come and change the whole game, aint he?"
"fucks with <propfirst> glover  would love to do a joint with him   and hopefully get an intro to his costars  needless to say i'm watchin the woodies and hopin i can win one in my early music ventures   wishful thinkin, i know"

i couldnt help but watch limitless and think to myself sooooo a fictional wonder drug in this movie makes cats over analyze shit and think like me  i had to laugh for a second but it helps my perspective i guess
"cause sometimes you feel tired, feel weak and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up   but you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse  ~em~"
