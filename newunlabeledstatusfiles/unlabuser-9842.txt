i've learned to never underestimate the impossible   
"this is going to be a bad night   wow, i'm already scared   ):"
"no one can make me cry, make me laugh, make me smile, or drive me like he does  "
  and some how you made me smile when i was sad 
"gonna put in a movie, and wrap myself in my snuggie, kinda a good way to end such a stupid day  "
"watch what you say around me   i'm vulnerable, easily broken   your words are like scissors   and i pretty much believe everything  "
"lets just press play, and watch as my life falls apart  "
 sad 
todays gonna suck   just like yesterday  
"if you only knew the trouble she's been going through, could you walk in her shoes?"
"well, that hurt   sad "

math homework is stupid  good night 
and i don't know what i'd do if i lost you  
"no one can make me cry, make me laugh, make me smile, or drive me mad like he does  "
)': why do you do this?  
i guess i'm the stupid one  
babe   i love so so much   i just dont want to lose you  
does it even matter? did you even notice my whole world shattered?
if you knew how scared she is   you'd never be able to look her in the eyes again  
what a bad day  
"your words were like shooting stars   now, more like sissors   i don't want to lose you  "
iloveyou  
8 23 10  love

heaven help me   because i can't help myself  
i just want you  
wow   thanks for the snow  
what a waste of a night   i just want to see you   ):
give me a reason to be here  
lets cry myself to sleep again  
"i'm going to smile like nothing's wrong, talk like everything's perfect, act like its all a dream, and pretend its not hurting me   but if you could feel what i do   i'm sure you'd be in tears  "
i need you so much right now   ):
i thought you'd be there to help me put it back together  
without you its hard to survive  
wish today would have ended better   i'm in so much pain    sad  i can't sleep   ugh  
that was my reason   now it's gone   ):
"it's hard to lose a love   but, you were my bestfriend  "
i wish 2moro would just never come  
she layed her heart right in your hands   not e playful ecting to get it back in pieces     no sleep at all   still trying to prepair myself for the worst days of my life  
i told you i couldn't do it   how can i honestly be strong  
"technically i'm single  \emotionally i'm completely taken  \cause, in my mind i'll always be his girl  \even if he doesnt want me anymore  "
i know i can stand   just pull me back up  
on the edge   just trying to survive  
i should have held onto my pride  
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful  
"she laid heart and soul right in your hands, and you stole her ever dream, and you crushed her plans   stupid boy "
"  and i know, i'll be just fine without you "
"but then something happened   the dream ended   i was forced to open\my eyes only to realize   that i had lost you once again  "
my friends think i'm moving on   the truth is i'm not that strong  
what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you  
"no matter what they say about love, i keep coming back for more  keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later i'll get what i'm asking for  "
you were the best nightmare a girl could have 
"cold, so i'm going to go take a bubble bath   smile "
"'cus you're amazing, just the way you are!  love "
"throat hurts    thanks for the cold, mom   annoyed "
"now i'm deafened by your silence, blinded by the tears, if you're looking for forgiveness, you won't find that here, because you lied your way to heart break, and now it's all too clear   that you will never be  "
not having the best day   annoyed 
mom's starting to piss me off!
at this point i'm more afraid of life than death  
lets just hit the play button and watch as my life falls apart  
now all i want is sleep   my life has the tendancy to fall apart when i'm awake  
blinded by the tears  
i never thought you'd be someone i'd have to miss  
sick of feeling this way  
blahhhh ):

"sad isn't it? how no matter what you do or say to me    when you come running back    when you need me again    i'll be here    right here waiting for you, i'll take you back    no questions asked  sad isn't it?"
he's lost the one girl who thought nothing was wrong with him 
"i made a choice to finally let go, because i can't stand the pain, it's time for my last tear to fall and smile again "
it's t-shirt time!
"or you could just not text back, thats cool too "
stupid boy  
"you always say you hate to see me hurt, and you hate to see me cry  so all those times that you hurt me, did you close your eyes?"
you said i'll be okay  
"so, i don't exactly know how to be your friend "
"dear brain, sorry for the memories  dear stomache, sorry for the butterflies  dear heart, sorry for the damage "
i just kind of thought that   maybe you'd save me 
"so i keep dreaming, you'll be with me and you'll never go  "
but i held onto you  
just another one of them days  
i miss who i thought you were  
when life finally drags you to the end of your rope   tie a knot and just keep holding on  
give me a break 
loved you once  love you still  always have  always will 
youâ€™re still the first person i think of when i wake up 
"iâ€™d take another <propmale>, take a fall, take a shot for you  i need you like a heart needs a beat, but itâ€™s nothing new "
"just burn, everybody take a turn, light a match under my paper heart "
   and the world continued to turn without any hesitation  
in bismarck until sunday!
"in bitchmarck, we gotta <propfemale>?!"
had a pretty interesting day today   hah 
"still in bismarck, want to <propfemale>? ask for my number and we'll make plans "
"wow, everyone is like fucking ditching    sad "
"i was <propfemale>, you were <propfirst>, and we were running    love "
what a great night    ):
"well thanks to my wonderful school, facebook is not blocked! but no thanks to my mom, i got my computer taken away, as well as my cell phone and the rest of my freedom "
"just another one of those \i miss you\"" days  """
"itâ€™s official: seeing you still makes my heart skip a beat, every broke-ass piece of it "
"every time i hear of something awful thatâ€™s happened to you i laugh and say, â€œkarmaâ€™s a bitch â€� but truly i wish i could be there to comfort you "
"rest in peace <propfemale> burdolski, *october 31, 2009* 1 year   you'll forever remain in my heart  "
"dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes   like you would be back again "
"i miss you, and you know it  "
get out of my head  
you're still the first and last thing i think of everyday  
"i woke up this morning around 4 a m  , with the <propfemale> shining bright like headlights on the interstate  i pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep, but thoughts of you kept keeping me awake "
"believe me, the pain will never go away  "
"you wonder why i don't talk to you anymore   and please believe me when i say it's not that i don't want to, it's just that everything i want to say i can't tell you anymore  "
i just can't quite take it anymore  
it feels so wrong to still want to run to you  
please pray for <propfirst>   i hope he's alright  
<propfirst>   ):
<propfirst>   you had me scared to death!   i'm so glad you're okay  
i don't know what i would do if i lost you  
glad i got to see you   i'm glad you're okay  
wow   i feel like i lost you too now  
"sorta ruined that one for me, eh?"
i ain't got a chace  
don't ever wipe your tears if you still want to cry  
"eh, that was legit "
"i can't believe his stories, i know that they're all lies  "
  and you're my reason 
"i'll keep you, my dirty little secret "
you knew i was pretty before i did 
"when iâ€™m alone and everything is still and quiet, thatâ€™s when i miss you the most  it feels like iâ€™m suffocating on our memories "
lightning won't strike the same place twice 
not impressed 
"you thought a lot of things, didnâ€™t you? why do you always have to be wrong?"
i have a feeling that i will never be as happy as you used to make me feel  
don't wake me up   my life has the tendancy to completely fall apart when i'm awake  
11:11   and i'm still wishing for the same thing  
"i don't need a lot of things, i can get by with nothing   but i need you "
you lost the one girl who thought nothing was wrong with you  
why do you get to me?
i donâ€™t see how i ever could have been crazy for you 
"remember my fortune cookie? yeah, you still owe me a romantic adventure in 2010 "
sick of not being worth the truth  
"i can't breathe without you, but i'll have to  "
"  stop talking to me, then maybe, just maybe i could finally get over you and move on with this damn life  "
that stupid four letter word  
what am i suposed to do when the best part of me was always you? what am i suposed to say when i'm all choked up that you're okay?   i'm falling to pieces  
i knew i shouldâ€™ve wrapped that blanket around us tighter 
sitting on babies 
treat me like i'm finally worth something  
make me feel worth it again  
"all the times i kissed you i was drunk, and i had not a drop of alcohol in my body "
"i've been beaten down, i've been kicked around, but he takes it all from me  it was all the same, all my pride and shame, but he put me on my feet   smile "
"it was always just â€œlove you,â€� because â€œiâ€� never really wanted anything to do with it "
"everyoneâ€™s always scrounging for more money, more time, more happiness  iâ€™m just scrounging for you "
iâ€™m not sad  i love you so much that sometimes it leaks out my eyes 
you've been on my mind    since i woke up today 
  it was only just a dream 
istead of completely shattering the last few pieces of my heart   please just leave me alone   i get your hint 
messaged recieved  
everyone told me it would get easier   it's get harder everyday 
"i just want to turn my back on this place, run, and never come back  "
"iâ€™m still mad at you, but mostly iâ€™m just mad that i still miss you "
i hate days like these 
to see a capital â€œjâ€� in a sentence makes my whole heart seize up and my body cringe  thatâ€™s how violently you haunt me 
i miss you a majority of the time  the rest of the time iâ€™m usually sleeping 
   and of course you immediately popped into my head 
"from the moment i kissed him, i knew i wasn't over you  "
but don't let them tell you that you aren't beautiful  
thanksgiving   annoyed 
"i wished someone would have warned me about you  truth is, i wouldnâ€™t have listened anyway "
"i'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you, i'd jump infront of a train for you, you know i'd do anything for you  i would go through all this pain, take a bullet straight through my brain! yes, i would die for you, but you won't do the same "
psychological fact- when a person cries and the first drop of tears falls from the right eye; it's happiness  when the first drop falls from the left; pain 
"so tell me, have you promised her 'forever' yet?"
don't tell me that the sky is the limit when there are foot prints on the <propfemale> 
so fucking sick of living here! i'd rather be living on the damn streets!
but why?
"hurts, don't it?"
make me another promise you'll never keep 
guess i was wrong 
"do you even miss me at all? wait, don't answer that "
ugh 
i meant every word 
'cause  i don't want to thing of sharing you with someone else  
i will always be   tu amor 
you can put the blame on me 
"please come back, and prove them wrong  "
"when words become useless, hold her hand "
when the fuck did we get ice cream!?
"summer get here faster, i want to go home  "
you're still my reason  
"even if i have to run away, i'm going to marry that boy someday  "
"i want to be the only one for <propmale> and <propmale>, except for maybe you, and your simple smile  "
"take your memories, i don't need them "
we waste a lot of time running after people we could have caught just by standing still 
just two more years   i think i'll live 
and those eye   i lost myself in them 
monsters don't sleep under your bed  they sleep inside your head 
"you used to shine so bright, it breaks my heart to watch you fade "
thats just my insecurities getting the best of me 
"behind every scar, there is a story  a story that says \i survived \"""""
"if i tell you i love you, can i keep you forever?"
"exclamation <propfirst>, exclamation <propfirst>, exclamation <propfirst> "
but   you can't put your arms around a memory 
"of all the lies, \i love you\"" was my fravorite """
"how am i supposed to know what i'm going to be doing with myself in 10 years, when i don't even know what to do with myself right now?"
"i can't decide if you're the reason i get up in the morning, or the reason i can't go to sleep at night "
"you act like i don't know? to tell you the truth, i don't give a shit  just stop ruining my day with your damn addiction "
"\you're a fuck up too \"" thanks mom """
save me  
"i'm not easy to understand, but you know me like the back of your hand "
i find you when i'm close the bottom
well today just sucks 
sometimes you'll never know the true value of a moment until it becomes just a memory 
"well, good night "
"it started off as butterflies, now it just hurts "
"well, good night  going home tomorrow "
"who do you think you are, running around leaving scars?"
"treat your love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while  catch it in a <propmale> jar with holes in the top, and run like hell to show it off "
"bye, new england "
"i just really miss you, right now i kinda need to "
great fucking night  love 
owning at guitar hero   smile 
if i ever left that town  i'd never settle down  
so tired  just wish you'd talk to me 
i just thought that maybe you'd save me 
"p s , i still need you "
i miss the way you used to miss me 
"it's ten steps in, and a hundred <propmale> back out  "
san antonio! smile 
"i think i'll \accidently\"" run into you next weekend """
i guess i don't quite know what to do with you anymore  
"there's a dark cloud hanging over my heart  i can't see where it ends, or where it starts "
i miss those blue eyes  
driving through wichita tonite is sure going to break my heart  
  and i could not ask for more 
i'd love to love you out loud  
ugh! bored as hell   text me?
"when you lose something, it's all you want back  you waited patiently, but it don't work like that  "
sorta glad the years over  annoyed 
won't be making it home tonight   happy new years  
home now  you have no idea how much i've missed you  
the best feeling in the world is knowing you finally took a step in the right direction 
"with their wicked words, they'll try to hold you down "
ugh! i'll just go to bed then  
just another day of bs tomorrow  
it's nice to see your <propfemale> shine again 
"i love <propfemale>aaa lockwood , hacked by <propfemale>"
cold  tired  happy  idk   bed time?
"they say that disney land is the \happiest place on earth \"" obviously they've never been in your arms """
  it's the way you made me laugh when i didn't even wanna smile 
i don't want anyone else to realize how amazing you are 
i'm so sick of today   time to annihilate friday  smile  night night 
"it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you, there's nothing that 100 men or more could ever do "
idk   sick of being single  sick of open relationships  sick of broken hearts  
 love 
so much on my mind   good night   love 
ugh   this sucks 
   text me?
total bs 
"oh well, i just need to get back to reality  "
that would only be delaying the inevitable 
"well, tonight is pretty lame   annoyed "
"on the days i can't see your eyes, i don't even want to open mine "
fine   goodnight 
you knew i was pretty before i did 
i'll love you until the sky falls down 
guess i'm going to bed  night 
it just scares me that there's only one of you  
friday needs to get here faster  this week seems like it will never end 
can we please not end up like them?
"never felt this hurt in a long time   i hate facebook, i don't like how much info i find on here   heart-broken "
i hope reality steps in one of these days and just bitch slaps me in the face 
"i don't hate you, it's just that   well, lets put it this way: if you were on fire, and i had water   i'd drink it "
"so much on my mind, so much stress  my head hurts so bad "
"so, i'm gonna walk away, and it's up to you to say how far "
so i got my 5th detention because my teacher's a dumb cunt 
so much for my happy ending 
"anyone can make you smile or cry, but it takes someone special to make you smile when you already have tears in your eyes "
we were never really friends in the first place 
this is me swallowing my pride 
rhabdophobia- fear of being severely punished or beaten by a <propmale>  what has this world come to?
you see right through me  how do you do that shit?
it's t-shirt time 
can't sleep  text  me 
"he's not the only guy in the universe, but he's the only one that matters anymore "
"1 mississippi, 2 mississippi, 3 mississippi  "
"each day i love you more; today more than yesterday, and less than tomorrow "
you and i are going to be okay  you know that right?
gooodnighttt   love  i love you too 
"i don't know what's with me, but whenever i'm around you i can't help but smile "
"ugh, can't get you out of my head now!  love "
"wow, it feels really good to actually do my homework instead of waiting until the last minute; monday "
i talk about you as if you're the one who put the stars in the sky 
"who actually knows me? i bet nobody can answer all the questions correctly?\? first name?\? middle name?\? last name?\? age?\? birthday?\? eye color?\? hair color?\? nickname?\? favorite color?\? best friend?\put this as your status to see who gets it right "
my cat just sneezed in my eye  ewwwww?
yes  no school!
well today's just sucked  good night 
"kinda makes you see things a little clearer, don't it? i've been pushed so far away the past couple of weeks  i don't even know what to do anymore "
neck hurts so bad  
i really need to get a life  
text me  can't sleep  
can't wait to completely annihilate friday 
"boy, you must have gone and bumped your head "
gave up  
you're such an ass hole 
your dream must be bigger than your fear   love 
made my day smile 
you told me that i'd understand one day  today's that day 
 love 
i'm boredddd 
"i can't waste time so give it a moment  i realize, nothing's broken "
doubt i'll be getting that hair cut any time soon  
"watching saw , ehh there's a lot of blood in this movie  annoyed "
"you know what, tell me the fucking truth from now on! i'm sick of findng shit out on my own "
i'm bored  i'm just going to bed i think  psh! who knows 
a girl can't wait forever 
"cullen, you have posted wayyyyy too many statuses in the past two hours  still love you though  "
why must it be so fricken cold? ugh!goodnight 
i do it just to feel like flying 
'cause it's my heart vs  common sense 
"i really didn't know what i was doing, but at least i tried "
"well, can't put your arms around a memory "
oxygen is wasted on people like you   annoyed 
damn cheese heads   annoyed 
goodnight love   
"mom took phone, dont text"
"whatever, i'm chosing your happiness over mine  obviously it's not what you want anymore so idk  i can't take it anymore  (still no phone, not allowed to be on the computer, but i found where mom hid it, grounded ) yeah   love you too  annoyed "
"no, things change because nothing's new to you anymore so you just get bored "
i'm not chasing you anymore   it won't do any good  
"so, what did you really want from me anyway?"
"guess whose single this valentines day?! i am, and i'm completely okay with that   smile "
i really do hate school  
sooooooooooooo sick n tired 
it's funny how you suck up to me now 
i need to find a way back to the start 
"no, facebook, i can't tell you what's on my mind, because these 'friends' are just a bunch of judgemental assholes "
it's amazing how it takes one person to ruin a day and one person to make it absolutely perfect again 
"i've never been lied to so much in my life   <propfemale>'s really gonna have fun with you, asshole "
thought my dreams were better than reality  i trust reality more than the dreams anyway  
pizza ranch! haha good times! love 
lizzy drank my potato coke 
"and so we stopped checking under the bed, because we realized that monsters were inside of us "
"no, this is <propfirst>!"
where were you when these walls came falling down?
"that's how depression hits  you wake up one morning, afriad that you're going to live "
"it's the little things, like falling asleep to your favorite song, that make life absolutely beautiful "
"people cry, not because they're weak  it's because they've been strong for too long "
"so here's to everything, coming down the nothing  here's to silence, that cuts me to the core "
i stopped making sense a long time ago 
i think i kinda need to get a life 
would you stay if she promised you heaven?
it's okay not to be okay  sometimes it's hard to follow your heart 
i see your smile in the stars  i see your lies in my scars 
i really wish i could come lay with you 
but instead i'm here drowning in my own fucking mind 
and you're too young and stupid to realize how young and stupid you really are 
what if i stopped loving the person i promised forever  
i am begging you to be my escape 
do you really think that i'd give up that easily?
hmm   i really liked you  ):
"just sitting back, delaying the inevitable "
sundays in bismarck suck 
or just lead me on  that's cool too 
you're the only risk i'm willing to take 
"single or not put this as your status and see what people want from you\a second chance\a friendship\a relationship\smash\   one nite stand\love \kiss, hug\a future"
i noticed that i tend to smile like a complete idiot when i'm talking to you 
"i'm not crazy, my reality is just a little different than yours "
you made me this rebel child 
too tired to do anything  too awake to sleep 
"wow, i'm <propfemale> bored  "
"i hate that i can't find someone whose worth my time, just like my best friend "
there needs to be more of 'you' out there 
i give up on saturday  goodnight  
  and not a single fuck was given that day 
"i really should be packing or something, but instead i'm on facebook  what a life "
"obviously i'm not making myself clear enough   i've realized that you're all i really have been looking for; someone who would be there for me, and wants to be with me   no one else  that's all i really want, and you've made it clear to me "
i'd give anything to be over loved  
i'm not your ghost anymore 
"what to do  ? so much unpacking, but no motivation to do it "
believe me when i say you're amazing   love 
"the pressure makes us stronger, the struggle makes us hunger  the hard lessons make the difference and the difference makes it worth it "
"just tell me what you want, and i'll be that for you "
"kind of a good day  mom got married  finally got my permit, no school for me  haha yeah it's a good day "
there's no use for posting my damn love quotes all over facebook   like you actually read them anyway
