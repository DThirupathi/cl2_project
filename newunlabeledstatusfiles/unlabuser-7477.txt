nothing like having the house to your self  you get to do things like cook breakfast nude wink makes breakfast taste better lol yum

much love to the jets they deserve this they have a <propmale> to be great  lets see what they do with it smile 
lust    there can never be love as long as there is lust  men have become so over powered by lust that love seems to lose it's meaning 
"amused  so some bull shit news site started telling people that facebook is shuting down on march 15 and people really got upset! one guy said \how am i supposed to make friends now\""  omg what have we become?  does he really think these people are friends the internet has changed the meaning of the word friend  get a life first then maybe you can get a friend """
listening to oldies

"the one night stand is classed as fun\\and secrets are kept well\\there is an unsigned agreement\\there will be no kiss and tell \\no home address is given,\\no personal file is kept,\\just memories of a nightime\\when two strangers never slept \\in the waking morning\\i watch you gather clothes\\you are pleasing to the eye\\and i am glad it was you i chose "
relaxing           
it's sad how people are discriminated against because someone with there skin color or someone of there same religion etc did something wrong  why must everyone pay for someone elses faults doings sins whatever you want to call them  just plain sad i wanna say what it really is fuc*** but i will keep it pg13
