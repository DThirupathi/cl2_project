"counting down    35 minutes until there's peace and quiet   ready for bed, tired of thinking    sad "
"ok, i've had quite enough of facebook     don't worry i'll be back tomorrow   smile "
"i slept like shit last night, i was either too hot or too cold, and for some reason, i just kept thinking   hopefully today is better than yesterday   "
"good news!!  the house is finally picked up and <propmale> is going to have a nap, finally!  then i can do the cleaning that he \helps\"" way too good with      smile """
"well, i've had a few beers and i'm ready to see facebook tomorrow!!"

"really hates doing laundry, and with 2 little ones, the laundry never seems to end    ugh!!"
   i'm pretty sure that this really sucks!!
"well, it's a new day, let's see what it has in store for me    "
i think i'm finally getting a new car   gotta love those e playful lorers!!!
"   because i'm pretty sure that if something else went wrong today, i wouldn't be surprised!!"
"well, its a new day and hopefully there is something new, not more of the same!!"
looking forward to tomorrow    some big things could be happening!!
hopefully there is good news today   keep your fingers crossed!!
"   it is what it is, it isn't what it isn't, so don't make it something that it's not   "
   loving the new place   loving my little babies   so excited for my new job!!
well today is a lazy saturday    don't really want to do anything and there is so much to do!  where is the motivation cause this coffee isn't working?!?
"well, i'm feeling pretty good about today    got a lot of important stuff done!!"

so the painters are painting my building    i'm trapped!!
"it's finally cooling off!!  time to shop for those winter clothes, can't wait   "
football and food    what a great combo!!
"well, 3 cups of coffee in and my house is spotless!!"
quiet time!!

what a day   
just had a blast at the park with the kids     now it's naptime!!!
"i love the rain, hate the wind, but where is the mail??"
long day      ready for a beer!!
just spent like the last 10 minutes dancing with <propmale>     so much fun!!
"laundry, laundry laundry     does it ever end??"
way too many errands today!!!  i'll need more coffee for today    
"i do not want to go to work today!!!  wanna stay home, watch football and play with my little ones   "
"i am sooo tired!!  ready for bed   worked way too much today, gotta get ready for tomorrow!!"
i wonder what today is going to have for me????

"<propmale> has a runny nose :[  feel so bad, i'm about to rub his nose raw     it's my brother's birthday and we can't celebrate "
well     today is going to be really uneventful   just boring laundry and cleaning   when does it end??

wow   
"well it could be a good day, right??"
is so excited for trick or treating
long day   
i'm just really sick of wondering     it's really not fair!!
"i feel like i always have laundry to do!  why can't it ever go away??  i'd like to be <propmale> and instead of washing clothes, i'll just go buy new ones!  in the meantime, tide is my best friend   "
"well, it seems like a lazy day today   "
"well, i can say that some people just don't really take care of their kids      i just don't understand!!"
wow     i can't believe today is already over!!  congrats to <propfemale> and the mighty muffins!!  great game girls    
it's such a beautiful day!!
i stayed up way too late last night   the coffee isn't working!!
can someone please tell my why <propmale> just went to bed??
"is on the job hunt!!  seriously     time for a change, i can't live like this anymore   i need more $$!!"
just hanging out at home with the kids   
brrrrrr    it's really cold outside!!
"the house is clean, the dishes are done, the kids are sleeping     what the heck am i supposed to do??"
"like i've said before,  it is what it is, it isn't what it isn't, so i'm not going to try to make it something it's not   "
"is just hanging out, enjoying a beer   "
"omgsh, just finally found a pacifier      you know about 3 seconds ago i woulda given my right arm for one?!?!?!?!?"
"well, what can today possibly have in store for me??"
"ok, <propfemale> has an ear infection       so darn sad!!"
"i'm thinking way too much, especially when the answer is so easy     "
is exhausted!!!
"just got off work, and now i don't want to do anything!!!  the kids are asleep and the house looks like a tornado just came thru     decisions, decisions, decisions "
the kids are asleep and the whole house is so clean   it's really nice to have such a great schedule   it's actually really nice to be able to have a schedule   i am so thankful for the good stuff in my life   
"well, to put it plainly, i'm bored   "
"well, i'm thinking that it's getting pretty close to my bedtime!!  so ready for a new day   "
"<propmale> and his friend, <propfemale> are having a nap right now, <propfemale> is in <propfemale>'s crib and <propmale> is in his     dude i wish i had a hidden camera to see what's really going on in there   do you think that they'll actually go to sleep?  ( i think i'm dreaming!!)"
enjoying too many beers with my lovey    
just got off work and both the kids are already asleep  sad   didn't get to say goodnight 
"just got my brother in trouble     didn't mean to, just wanted to smoke a cigarette with him   prego people really are crazy!!"
just got off work! worked all dang day long!  so exhausted   now it's time to make dinner 
"just hanging out at home, relaxing   had a long day at work today   not ready for tomorrow, <propfemale> is getting her 6 month shots   (hurts me more, right? sad  that's what my mom tells me to make me feel better)"
<propfemale> is 19 ponds 2 ounces and 27 1 2 inches long   she's a growing girl!!
have i ever told anyone how much i love my kids? (even when <propmale> figures out how to open a brand new box of cheerios and disperse them throughout the living room)
"well, great start to another day     gotta work tonigt, and i'm not looking forward to it!"
"got off work at 1015 and was pleasantly surprised when <propfemale> was still awake!!  so lucky, she must've waited for her mommy   "
just haning out doing the 'puter with <propfemale>    
"good start today, let's hope the day ends like that!!"
"happy thanksgiving!!  i'm thankful for my family, they give me exactly the support i need!!"
"well, the day went smoother than i thought   i am soooo thankful for my mom, she is so great   i hope that i can be there for my kids the way she is there for me!"
just got home from work     thanks for everything mom!!
"well, the house is clean     that's good!    sad "
had a pretty decent day today!!  worked and got to play with the kids!!!!  yay!
"have so much stuff to take care of, and i just want to crawl back in bed!!  where's the motivation?"
"well, it's haircut time, and have a ton of running around to do   the kids and1"
interruption by <propmale>       the kids and i will be busy all day long   where's the coffee??
getting stuff done around here!!  feels really good 
"brrrr    it's so cold outside!  good day to relax and watch some football   hopefully i'll be motivated to clean a little bit   smile   p s  i'm so excited to see my family this weekend!  it's going to be so much fun, can't wait!!"
where's the airborne??  i think i might be getting sick!!  gotta take care of myself so i can take care of <propmale> and <propfemale>     keeping my fingers crossed 
"can someone please tell me why my keyboard is all sticky??  oh yeah, my son is only a year and a half and has very important stuff to do on the computer     man, i love my son!!"
i'm going to get my christmas tree today!!  so excited     now all i need are decorations!
"brrr    it's freakin' cold outside!!  i'm wearing 2 sweatshirts and it still doensn't seem like enough!  i'm so ready to see my family this weekend, we always have such a good time "
the day is finally here!!  feels like i've been waiting forever to see my family!  i can't wait to see everyone tonight     the weekend is going to go by soooo fast   soak it up while it lasts i guess   happy birthday papa!!
i just spent the last hour laying in bed with <propmale> and <propfemale>     so much fun i didn't want to get up   i love my kids   
"just hanging out with <propfemale>!!  so much fun   i love her to pieces, even when she tries to type stuff with me   "
somehow both of the kids are entertaining themselves!!  this is great     i wonder how long it's going to last   smile 
i can't decide if i want to stay up and watch tv or if i should go to bed     maybe i'll accidentally fall asleep with the tv on   smile 
"so both of the kids are already sleeping     i know, i'm good   now the rest of the night is mine!!   smile "
i had a few too many cups of coffe and i'm out if things to clean   
everyone is asleep and i think i'll join them    
"the kids slept in a little bit today, probably because the were up almost all night for some reason or another   can someone direct me to the coffee?"
"arrrrgggghhh!!! i have to get ready for work and i don't wanna     i feel like a little kid that doesn't want to go to school   man, i wanna stay home and play, play, play!"
it was so bus at work tonight     happy to be home!!  so sad that both the kids are already asleep  can't believe how much i miss them!
"i just decided that my 2 favorite beverages are coffee and beer   not together of course, but i love them both, equally as much, but for oh so different reasons!!"
"just got home from the dr's   <propmale> took his shots like a champ, but he's got another ear infection!!!  it's so sad cause he shows no sign of pain, and i'm not a mind reader   "
i'm happy that it's raining   
i have a feeling that it's going to be a good day     it's beautiful outside and i'm already in a great mood   i'm beginning to wonder what's in this coffee   smile 
the 4 of us were out looking at christmas lights    <propmale> was more interested in his <propmale> taco cup and <propfemale> slept   go figure!!  (the lights they did see they liked though)
too bad so sad     
i was going to say good morning but <propfemale> (my senial neighbor) just came over to have a chat     save me!!
work work work     
is enjoying a chocolate milkshake     been a while since i've had one 
"well, <propmale> decided to get up at 7, something i wasn't quite ready for    i have a feeling that it's going to be a long day!!  3 cups in and many more to go "
what a beautiful day   
putting an end to my very <propfemale> christmas     happy to finally be home and the kids are sleeping!!
"today was great    my closet best friend came over to visit me and the kids were driving me crazy!!  all with good intentions i think   i really like being a mom though, so rewarding    especially when everything seems to be so chaotic    smile "
"well, today has been quite interesting   "
brrrrrrr  it's cold outside   not worth it to go out for anything    well maybe a million dollars   smile 
i just took down my christmas tree   so ready to start the new year   i wonder if <propmale> is going to notice that it's gone?  there is a big empty spot where it was     spacious!!
why is shopping so exhausting??
"<propmale> had a way too late nap    i would usually be looking forward to 8, but not tonight, we have a good hour before he even thinks about sleeping!!"
ready to enjoy my new years at home     gotta pick up first!!
"had so much fun last night!!  surprised i'm not hungover   going out for a \family\"" dinner   ready to eat!!   smile """
i need a good night's rest   
"man    i was surprisingly busy today   odd for a sunday, or any day for that matter   now my laundry is getting done and i have groceries, the kids are clean and so is the house   just sucks cause all those things are just a part of being a mom    i like playing toys better!!"
"i wonder about people sometimes, are their lives not fulfilling enough that they would have to go out of their way to make things uncomfortable for people that have absolutely no impact on their life?  there is no reason, except to be hurtful and mean   "
<propfemale> <propmale> and i are just hanging out playing toys    so much fun!
"well, it was a really long day out and about with <propmale> and <propfemale>    glad to be home with <propfirst> relaxing   wonder what tomorrow has in store for me   "
"had a great dinner with <propfemale>, <propmale>, and <propfirst>   i just want to know why i always make tacos when <propfemale> comes over!!"
good morning!!  i'm thinking that today is going to be a good day    at least only one can hope   smile 
man trying to get my kids to perform for a picture requires a lot of <propfemale>!!  and i still didn't get the one i wanted   
black    
"omgsh      running errands this morning, cleaning this afternoon, and now i'm cooking   definately going to be an early night  "
"sooooo tired, had a really big day today, and now i'm off to bed   "
"wow, what a day of being lazy      smile "
"just another day     i think it's going to be the same as any other   but somehow, <propmale> remains to be unpredictable    smile "
"dude,, why am i so lazy??  i don't want to do anything!!"
took <propfemale> out to run errands with me today     some much needed mommy daughter time    she looked so cute in her jeans and leopard <propfemale> shirt   too bad she won't let me do her hair!!
"ok, so it's time to make dinner    is it bad that i would rather order a pizza than cook?  lazy, lazy, lazy!!!"
"i want <propfemale> to start crawling already     but then again, i'm not sure if i want to <propmale> 2 little monsters around!!"
"be very careful if you make a woman cry, because god counts her tears  the woman came out of a man's rib, not from his feet to be walked on, not from his head to be superior, but from his side to be equal! under the arm to be protected, & next to the heart to be loved "
"just hanging out with my friend <propfemale>, having a few beers   "
hello     
"shower time!!  then off to run errands     easy stuff, that's not so easy with <propmale> and <propfemale>   we aren't leaving for like 2 hours but i've gotta start getting ready now if i want to make it   i never understood why my mom always got up so early, now i get it!"
"ok, i get it   "
10 inches  sad 
i wonder what today is going to have for me!!  i've got a lot on my mind and not enough sleep!  where's the coffee?
"football, laundry and cleaning!!  what a day, what a day   "
"just found out today that i'm going to have a nephew!!!  i'm finally going to be an auntie, yay!"
i hate the wind!!!
i really hate the wind and it doesn't seem to want to go away!!  ready for another change in the weather   
i'm having a grand old time over here at <propfemale>'s      miss having the internet   so soon i can't hardly wait!!!!!
what a beautiful sunday    
"had a great bbq with <propfemale>, miah, <propmale> and the kids      now getting ready to relax the rest of the night away   maybe a few more beers will do the trick!!"
wow     i'm really tired of chasing something that will never be there!  where is the light at the end of my tunnel?  i've learned my lesson and this isn't funny anymore   
wow wow wow     what else is new??
"here we go, on my way to a brand new life!!  i just want to know why it has to be so hard   "
"just hanging out today, kinda feels good to have a day off from this chaos!!!"
to finally have some time to think is nice     i'm beginning to realize that everything being upside down right now is better than always being  backwards    right?
(sigh)
had a long day today     too bad i didn't have a babysitter to go out tonight!
long weekend        longer week ahead!!
"it's funny how i have a bunch of stuff to do, and i'm atually excited to start getting it done!  weird, usually it's like 3 in the afternoon before i have any energy to do anything!!"
what ever happened to traditional nap time?
feeling really bad cause i just ripped <propfemale>'s head off   good thing she just told me that i'm crazy and laughed at me!  that's when you know you have a real friend   
"should go to bed now, my alarms don't have a snooze button     they just keep yelling mama louder and louder!!!"
"can my car just be ready today??  i'm so ready to have a little freedom back!  not that i have anywhere to go, but i'm sure that i'll find somewhere!!  lol!!!!!"
"feeling anxious, and i don't know why   "
naptime is the greatest!!  i love that i have a few minutes to myself to prepare for the afternoon!
"ok, remember that natime thing?  yeah, not happening today   now i have 2 extra loads of laundry, and grumpy kids!  what's really going on here, and who's on this consipracy against me?"
getting ready to take the kids out and enjoy the beautiful day!!
"(sigh) why does <propmale> insist on pushing <propfemale> over?  she is so innocent, and he just does it because i don't know why      maybe he doesn't either!"
"playing wii bowling, having a few beers, and hanging out with quattro, <propfirst>, and auntie <propfirst>      is my arm going to be tired tomorrow??  lol!!"
"gotta get moving this morning, i'm already a half an hour behind schedule      and why am i on facebook??  lol   "
i absolutely love it when things keep falling into place!  it's amazing how when you cut the crap outta your life things seem to work out    why is that?
"just hanging with my closet bf, <propmale>, <propfirst>, and <propfirst> wondering what happened to my 12 pack i bought last night     i guess i'm a good sharer "
"just had lunch at burger <propmale> with <propmale>, <propfemale> and <propmale>     i think they all had a great time cause gav and <propfemale> were so worn out that they went right to sleep!"
i could very easily throw up right now   i ate way too much pizza!!  had a great time though!
"i love waking up refreshed, ready to start my day     "
"whenever god closes one door he always opens another, even though sometimes it's hell in the hallway"
i just cleaned up all the blocks and <propmale> immediately brings me the bag and wants to dump them out and scatter them everywhere   then he just leaves them lone until i pick them up again       it's a vicious cycle and i'm tired of picking them up!!  lol   
"wow, i'm trying to figure out the best way to get rid of this hangover or operate with it!!  i didn't even drink enough to feel this way      so not fair!!"
"gotta get on this packing thing, again!  i'm really over it and ready to be settled in already   it's closer than i think   "
"how come when you are in a hurry to get ready to go somewhere, you still have a few extra minutes to sit on facebook??  this darn thing makes me late more than my kids do!!  walk away from the computer!!!  lol   "
"had a fabulous night tonight    gotta get some much needed rest for the big move tomorrow!  hopefully <propfemale> and <propmale> are getting good sleep cause if not, i should've gone to bed when they went to bed "
wow    having a great start to a day that hopefully turns out ok   it's the next step in the new llife 
oh man oh man oh man!!  so anxious!
"omgsh, i'm online again!!  back in action!"
good morning!!  i wonder what is going to happen today?
what's good??  lol     i'm going out tonight!  thanks mon
why is it that traveling even a short distance with 2 kids under 2 is soooooo exhausting??
"how come everything <propfemale> has, <propmale> comes and takes?  even if he decided 2 seconds ago that he didn't want it? lol   "
"<propfemale> refuses to crawl, but somehow she can still scoot aound and get to where she wants to go, i have a feeling that when she is finally walking, i'm going to be in big trouble!!"
"just ready to relax!!  the kids are talking to eachother in their own baby language, and i wonder how long it will take for them to finally pass out   "
when will the laundry stop??  seems like i always have a ton of laundry to do!
why does my two year old test every ounce of <propfemale> i have??
"i have a feeling that it's going to be a slow, boring day today    but at least almost all of my laundry is done, because it can never be all done!  p s  i wonder how many times <propmale> will want to watch the blues clues movie i just found, i'll be singing that damn song for a week!  lol   "
please can we have real nap today kids?  certianly doesn't sound like it    
"ooops!  i went outside and brought the dog with me, then i forgot to let him back in    so sorry <propfirst>   sad "
is officially tired!
why did <propmale> just dump out the whole box of kix all over the place?
is this a dream?  are the kids really having a nap without all the talking and playing first?
"just ready to relax, don't see that coming anytime soon, but one can hope!!"
"so, <propfirst> <propmale> is getting his 8th divorce, <propfemale> <propfirst> is possibly getting married for a 9th time, <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods are screwing everything, yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage?? really?? feel free to copy and paste if you agree   "
<propmale> must've had super sleep last night cause he has so much energy    we are definitely going to the park today!!
this is great!  a real nap that is lasting more than an hour!!  how did i get so lucky??  or am i just that good?
"well, i had a great day of doing nothing    nice for a change   tonight seemed to have an interesting twist, glad it's not my problem   lol!!"
i feel like i'm cleaning up after <propmale> all the time!  when will it end?
"dude, my ears are burning, does that mean someone is thinking about me or talking about me?  either way, i wish they would stop!!"
"going to the gym, like my second time in my life     i wonder how this is going to be   smile "
"alright      had a good time at the gym!!   but, coming home <propmale> threw my wallet, out the window, on the freeway   great!  <propfemale> just cried the whole time    good news is that it took me only 5 minutes at the dmv, new record, right?   grrrr     "
"took <propfemale> to the doctor today, if hse doesn't have an ear infection, could somebody please tell me why she whines non stop?"
can someone please tell me why it's snowing?  i thought it was almost may   
boring day today    getting more laundry done though!
i think i'm going to end up in the funny farm    
so today was a pretty long day      so ready for tomorrow!!
"was just remembering that on may 16, both of my kids will be 1   i think it's pretty cool!!"
"it's naptime!  i have much more important things to do than sit on facebook, yet i am still here    where is the motivation?"
"even though it is unfortunate that the kids were just up, it feels so great that the only one they wanted to see come through that door to their rescue was their mommy    the laughing and babbling right now confirms it   i love being a mom!!"
i just wonder how people can be so fake and contradicting!!!!  it makes me so mad and so sad for the peole that i love     
"took the kids to the park   <propmale> is so cute, when we pulled up, and he saw the slides, he starts pulling on his carseat straps and yelling \weee!!\""  i think he was refering to the slides   """
"ok, time for bed   was up way too late and the kids were up way too early this morning   no re-runs please!!  night   "
"long day today, even longer one tomorrow    having lunch with my gramma, i hope gav and <propfemale> don't do anything super embarrassing    smile "
"ok, i thought that today was long     tomorrow starts bright and early at 515   is this what it's like to be a real adult?"
"each day is getting longer, but more productive   i have to say, i love it!!"
dinner   check   baths   check   bed    double check    smile 
"can't wait for the weekend, a break from all the things i should be doing and a <propmale> to relax, if there is such thing with 2 kids under 2   "
hanging out with my closet bf     yes i said closet!!
"just got home from the backyard bbq    so much fun until both the kids were having a meltdown, together!!  got to see <propmale> dyrdek though   smile "
"i am kid free right now, until tomorrow at 10am   i don't know what to do with myself!!  feels good though   smile   thanks mom!"
"note to self: do not under any circumstance ever give <propfemale> a redbull and rockstar in one day   she is off the hook!!\p s   i'm so ready for tonight!  (and so thankful that i don't have <propmale> and <propfemale> until 10am tomorrow, happy birthday and mother's day to me!!)"
"i had the birthday weekend of a lifetime    had some needed relaxing on friday night with my very best friend, went out to lunch on saturday and saw <propmale> dyrdek, got to <propfemale> out with some really great people last night and had an amazing celebration, spent time with my family, and got to enjoy my little ones   right now, i feel like the luckiest peron alive!!"
didn't want to get up this morning     been up 6 hours already and still going strong!!
"ok, day one went great!  can anyone tell me why the girls at daycare said that <propmale> didn't cry all day except for when he saw me?  kinda funny how that works   "
"i realy should go to bed now, and i don't think that the rockstar this afternoon is helping     i guess it's just going to be a long day tomorrow    sad "
"ok, i think that this morning <propmale> realized that i was going to leave him all day because he seemed pretty upset when i dropped him off at daycare today    sad "
"ok, i am so lucky to have the best friend that i have   i was thinking about it and i would be so lost without her   god really knew what he was doing when he put her in my life   smile "
"<propfemale> has finally started to crawl   i don't think it's going to last long though, she's pulling herself up on everything   she must be learning all of this in daycare, i've tried for 6 months to get her to crawl with no success!"
the suspense is driving me crazy!!  and i have a feeling that what i'm waiting for is going to be completely and totally irrelevant   
had a really good day today   a great end to a busy week   so looking forward to spending the weekend with my babies       smile 
is thoroughly irritated!
both of my kids are 1      weird!!
the second interview tomorrow at 9am!!  i am so excited and nervous all at the same time   
is facebook really going to start charging a monthly fee?
"i am so exhausted  the week is almost over, but <propmale> and <propfemale> are going to be getting up at 7, saturday or not     can somebody please tell me why little kids don't sleep in??"
good morning!  i'm not ready to be awake     where's the coffee?
so it's firday night and i just might go to bed early    does that mean i'm lame?
"so i was busy all week, and now i'm doing laundry and cleaning all weekend to get ready for next week   will it ever end?  i know once everything is all clean it will feel great, but will i get it all done before naptime is the real question   "
i hate it when <propmale> doesn't get the appropriate amount of naptime      makes everyone miserable!!
"today seems like a lazy day, i don't want to do anything!!  good thing i did most of my laundry yesterday     it just seems like the day to lay in bed and watch a movie!!"
man     i'm exhausted!!  i didn't do anything too crazy today either   and i can't go to bed yet cause it's too light outside and i'll wake up a million times     i decided i am lame!!
now the suspense is really kicking in!!  can the lady just call me already!?!  i just keep praying that this is the job for me     maybe i should pray for <propfemale> too!  smile 
"had a great day today, and so far tonight isn't half bad!!  the kids are getting ready for bed     no complaints so far!"
(sigh)
"alright     i'm moving way too slow this morning, maybe it's cause i'm just waiting and hoping   very exhausting!  but i'm excited for the kids to get up, it's been a long 12 hours without them   smile "
<propmale> woke up before me this morning    makes it a little difficult to get ready when the kids look so cute cuddled in my bed watching <propmale>       smile 
"i'm hoping for good news today, otherwise i'm going to have to start all over again   sad "
getting ready to enjoy this fabulous weekend with my little loves     hopefully they are just as excited as i am    smile 
"really, the kids went right to sleep?  how did i get so lucky?  now i have plenty of time to relax before 7am   smile   i still want to know why kids don't sleep in   "
when will these runny noses stop?!?  aren't you supposed to be healthy in june?
"had a great weekend, now it's time to get serious and get ready for the week      smile "
"ok, it's only 930 and i'm thinking it's time for bed    looking forward to tomorrow, a day full of nothing   smile "
i can't believe my baby is going to be 2 tomorrow    
"happy birthday to <propmale>!!  he even woke up before <propfemale>, like he knows today is special   we're moving into the terrible twos    great    smile "
"all bad news today   sad   just wasn't the plan for me   i thought today would be better, especially since it's gav-v-v's birthday     hopefully things will turn around!!"
"well, tonight sucked too, but at least i had great company!!   smile   tomorrow is a new day, let's see what opportunities await me   "
"ok, i am pretty sure today qualified as a bad day   "
i really like it how <propmale> gets up before <propfemale>     it's nice to have some one on one time   smile   don't really appreciate the cheerios all over my bed though   
so i got the job!!  had my first day today     just wish it wouldn't be so gross outside!!
"i had so much fun tonight    what a great way to celebrate my new job!!  taking the kids to the zoo tomorrow, hopefully it isn't a humid as today!!"
omgsh    it is way too hot!  i hate it   
good morning!!  i've got to start getting ready for the week!  boring stuff like laundry and cleaning         sad       but it's my first full week in a while!!
"it has been a really long weekend, and i didn't do anything!!  i even had a nap today, and i'm still tired!!"
"i'm trying to get ready for work, but for some reason i am sitting on facebook    it's still going to be a good day!!"
"i'm not tired, but i'm going to try to go to sleep   5am comes quick!!"
good morning  i'm tired   not used to this yet   
i should go to bed    morning has been coming too quickly lately 
i am already so tired!!  getting ready to go to the gym   
"ok, i'm home now    still tired and have to do some of the never ending laundry!!  half way through the week though, i'm still alive       smile "
i have a feeling that today is going to be a good day    smile 
"(sigh) <propmale> has a fever, gotta go pick him up from daycare (<propfemale> too)      early day for us i guess    sad   poor guy "
"wow      i can't believe what i just found out!  my stomach is upside down   where is my bf?  we need to talk, asap "
"ok, i thought i said that today was going to be a good day    jinxed myself from the very beginning "
my back hurts really really bad         sad   i've been full of complaints lately!!
"my back still hurts!  i hope i didn't do something permanent, i am having a hard time carrying my kids    this is not good    sad "
moving on now   
"i am really thankful that god has given me the strength to keep moving forward     and plus i have the best support, ever!!  i even surprised myself today, never felt like i could do it, but it's easier than i thought!  does that mean i'm growing up?   smile "
it is such a beautiful day!!  i think i'm going to take my kids to the park   maybe they'll get rid of some of this energy        smile 
"so <propmale> is about to start talking up a storm   he said a few things to me today, like 3 words sentences    i know i'm the only one that could understand him because i'm the mommy   i love him   "
"i'd have to say that today was a pretty good day, considering it was a monday    let's hope the week is the same!!"
"well, i guess it's time for a movie and bed, now-a-days tomorrow comes quickly, and with no remorse     but every day is a step forward, and that makes me so happy!!"
i'm not going to let facebook consume my morning again!!  i hate rushing    
sometimes i think i hide behind the fact that i should be ok   
"alright, time for bed, i falready don't want to wake up!!  lol   "
"good morning!!  i have lunch plans today, and i'm so so excited    "
today's been a crazy day!!!  so ready to be off work        smile 
"because really, i'm about to snap, and then when you need me, i'm going to laugh   "
"good morning! i wonder what today has in store for me   i hope today is better than yesterday, and yesterday was pretty good    smile "
"because i went to bed at like 830 last night, i'm not really tired this morning!!  that was unintentionally responsible      lol!!"
"ok, so my phone is shot!!  i can't see anything on my screen anymore     rwelp, time for a replacement!!"
"9 minutes and counting      maybe i can go home early   smile   yeah, in wish land!!"
"every night is a celebration, and now i really have something to celebrate!!"
i'm having a really great day   
"really, i'm spending my friday night doing laundry, cleaning my room, and washing the  car?  wow   "
getting ready to get outta here!!  just about another half hour and then we'll be on our way       smile 
i totally thought that today would turn out better   not quite what i was e playful ecting    sad 
great end to an ok weekend   gav got a haircut     he looks so old   i love him!!
"i am so ready to start today!  lots of important stuff to do, gotta get serious and get it done!!"
so so so ready for this work day to be o-v-e-r!!  went by so fast until like 30 minutes ago!!
"<propfemale> has an ear infection, again   poor little girl, she just needs to get better already!!   sad "
"ok, today was much worse than yesterday, it seems like it's never going to end!!  i wanna go home!"
"all bad news, all day long          can it get any worse?"
"<propfemale> still doesn't feel good!!  i feel so sad that i can't do anything to help her     hopefully by the time i pick her up, she'll be a happy girl    smile "
"just got home, got some new clothes    first time in i can't remember how long i only bought stuff for myself   feels kinda good!!"
"had my first appointment with my personal trainer yesterday       not only did he kick my butt, i am so so sore too, this is no joke!!"
"i am pretty sure i have the best kids ever   they are so good almost all the time!!  i am so lucky, i love them to pieces and death!!"
"today was actually a pretty good day, considering it was a monday!!  can't wait for this weekend   "
i feel buff already    
day #3 and i'm actually ready and looking forward to it     i think!!
"well, as of right now i'm pretty sure i'm going to be hating life!!  as <propfemale> put it, i'm going to have to pour my kids out of their crib tomorrow morning!!  great   "
i'm ready for today!  hopefully work isn't as crazy as it has been!!
i am so over this day!!!  i want to go home     
<propfemale> just took 3 whole steps all by herself    i'm in for it now!!  it is so exciting though   
"the kids are actually playing together    sibling entertainment is coming!!  along with the fighting, whining, and tattling!! great   "
i had a great 4th   got to spend it with an awesome group of people   too bad my kids didn't like the fireworks  maybe next year   
feeling so good   
kids are clean and in beds    time to relax and do nothing!!
i can't find my phone!!
"going to the doctor's again!!  seems like if one is sick the other is well, or they're both sick   it's been a while since they were both well     "
i'm going to be so sore tomorrow!! no questions   
i love short weeks!!  friday is almost here       smile 
on call this weekend!?!?  great    
friday is almost here    this week went by so fast!!
"i am so busy at work!!  i'm really happy that it's friday, but oncall is going to kick my ass (i think)"
"so at about 630 the kids were so hungry they were melting down, and i'm trying to get the <propfemale> of this oncall thing       i can't believe that i made it through it, and got some calls dispatched!!  money, money, money    "
remind me that i never want oncall ever again!!  i've been working non-stop   and naptime is almost over        sad   i feel like i haven't gotten to spend any time with my kids   i hate that   
i love my kids so much   everyday they learn new things and never cease to amaze me   they remind me to smile when i think i have nothing to smile about   i am so lucky    
"i am so excited to give this oncall back!!  i don't see how a person can be oncall and have a life!!  i worked all weekend long, i'm almost looking forward to going back to work     and i sat at the er to find out that <propfemale> is just getting teeth, great weekend   hopefully next weekend is better "
i am so glad monday is over    i hate mondays!!!
"going to the gym, i'm actually really excited   "
great work out at the gym tonight!!  really worked hard tonight    
i'm ready for the weekend already   at least i'm half way through the week     
just went to whole foods       that place is really cool   never been there before 
can somebody please tell me why i'm paying my personal trainer to make me run outside?
"happy almost friday      smile   getting closer, so many things to look forward to "
"i got my butt handed to me again at the gym, but i know it's for the best!! finally get a night off tomorrow     smile "
"wow, lots of good news already!!!  i can't wait for next weekend!"
pretty sure that tonight calls for a few beers!!
"i love the weekends! get to <propfemale> out with my kids, feels like i don't get to see them all week long  now if only they would have a nap so they're not grumpy   "
"had so much fun last night    now just hanging out do absolutely nothing   the countdown to next weekend begins, it's going to be the longest week ever!!"
ready for the week     i think  smile 
i really hate it when i get the bad mood when it's not my fault   really it sucks   
"i hate mondays, especially ones like this   "
i'm hoping for a better day today   
"had a good workout tonight, going to be sore tomorrow!! 2 days and counting   "
<propfemale> has been sleeping for 5 hours    
finally got a much needed cut and color    it looks absolutely beautiful!!  thanks <propfemale>  smile 
i'm tired of today     let's just skip to tomorrow afternoon   smile 
so excited   
finally on our way    can't wait to get this started already!!
"<propfemale> just walked into the sliding glass door, at first she was kidding, but then i realized the she just a dork!!! so something i would do   "
help!! <propfemale> is off the hook!! i love her   
"great food, great people, great weather    what more could a girl ask for?  more alcohol!!! lol   "
getting ready for night number 2!! nothing can prepare me for this   
weekend of a lifetime!! so much fun! thanks girls   
apparently my kids were so good this weekend    <propfemale> has pretty much cried since i picked her up!!  still so happy to be home with my loves   
i am so tired!!!  i can't even handle it right now!!
<propfemale> ate 2 pieces of pizza tonight    that's my girl!!
so not ready for today      it's going to be very interesting!!
today just keeps getting better      
thank god this week is almost over!!!!!
"i am in such an a-mazing mood today, i just hope it lasts        smile "
i don't want to go to the gym tonight!!!   i just want to go spend money      smile 
i'm a lucky girl   
how come when i have a clean car it seems like it runs better??
what a long day today!! i'm so ready for tomorrow   
i'm so not ready for today!!  just want to crawl back in bed!!
wow   
i can't believe that it's already wednesday   
yeah    don't care 
i love it when the kids and i are driving down the road and i look in the back seat and <propmale> and <propfemale> are bobbing their heads to the music    i love them!!
"so i started taking these really great vitamins, and i can't believe what a difference it's making     "
it's about to be a really bad day!!
we were annihilated at the gym tonight   
i forgot that i'm on call this weekend       sad 
"grrrrrr       so happy it's naptime, i can finally get caught up on this oncall bs "
can't decide if i want to take a nap or not   
i can't believe that the kids are still sleeping! this is absolutely wonderful   
surprisingly i feel really good this morning    ready to take on sunday with my loves!!
just had a great breakfast with my girls    now it's time for a nap!!   wink 
had a great day of doing nothing    then had a nice swim and bbq with the fam! beyond ready for bed   
i am so not ready for the gym tonight    just barely recovering from last week!!
"off to get the kiddos, then straight to the gym    still not ready for this!"
so on our way through the parking lot into the gym <propmale> was acting like a normal 2 year old and walked straight into a parked car!! he's so tough he didn't even cry   
"ok, i'm feeling like it's going to be a good day     "
off to get my loves!!  i'm excited to see them   
i love being single   
can today be over yet?  i am just over it   
i just wanna go home!!  i have way too much work to do   
so happy the weekend is here!!!
i love it that <propfemale> is a full time <propmale> now!!
"wow, what a weekend!!  so not ready for today    i think i'll make it out alive!"
off to lunch!!  i'm starving!!
"well, i'd have to say that today wasn't so bad for a monday, now i'm off to get murdered at the gym      smile "
"taking my little girl to the docotr today      so excited that we get to spend some mommy <propfemale> time, without gav     girls only!!"

"omgsh, <propfemale> was singing in the car on our way to and from dinner    so freaking adorable!!  i love her   "
"i am tired today, hopefully i can make it through the day    "
i hope gav and <propfemale> are in a good mood when i pick them up!!!
note to self: never agree to do cardio with <propfirst>     ever again!!
i don't think today is going to be a good day   
"i am so glad that this work day is almost over, i'm not sure if i could take anymore!!"
i am so sick of this week      ready for the weekend for sure!!  half way there   
"i am so happy that tomorrow is friday    now if it could just hurry up and get here, i'd be in good shape!"
i really hope everything goes well tonight!!!
"really, cause tonight was a-mazing!!"

"so, i can't find my phone, anywhere!!  it's lost   "
beyond ready for lunch!!!!  i'm starving   
i'm finally starting to feel better   
i am sooooo tired!!  i found my phone though      smile 
"i am so tired!!  as soon as the kids go to bed, so am i   "
fake it 'til you make it   
"there comes a point in your life when you realize who matters, who never did, and who wonâ€™t anymore   so donâ€™t worry about the people from your past, thereâ€™s a reason why they didnâ€™t make it to your future "
"had so much fun last night!!!!!  but really, there was no way it could've been any different     not really having so much fun today at work, but it's worth it!"
 smile

i'm the new miss march
i have a feeling that this week is going to take forever!  i can just hope that it doesn't and be thankful that it's only a 4 day week   
"if the 49ers wouldn't screw up so much, then maybe they'd have a <propmale>   stupid    "
"ok, pretty sure this is going to be one crazy week        smile "
i am so ready for today to be over!!  i'm seriously ready to start thursday!!  can we fast forward through wednesday??  it can't be anything good   
cheeseburger meatloaf and cheese potatoes    anyone hungry???
oh wednesday    i've never been so happy to see you      party starts tomorrow!!
i'm pretty sure that my great idea wasn't a good idea at all      
"ok, so thursday is finally here!  i am so ready   been looking forward to this weekend for months!!  it's about to be crazy    "
i am so ready to get outta here!!  this last hour seems like it's going to be the death of me!!  i wish i could leave early

"so thankful that today is tuesday, i'm just not sure if could handle 5 days of work this week      "
one day until professionalism      
pretty sure today keeps on getting better   
"alright alright, thursday is already here!!  i can't believe it came so fast this week    now lets just hope that this day goes just as fast!"
can i just say that i love thursday nights       
the only thing i hate about thursday nights is that i have to come to work on friday     at least i made it ontime this morning 
today doesn't feel like friday       thank god it is!!
just spent the last half hour dancing around the house with the kids       i love them!!!

it's just about t-shirt time!!!!  so ready

i absolutely hate mondays     
"i really hope that <propmale> and <propfemale> are in a good mood, cause i missed them so much today!!  keepin' my fingers crossed     "
i'm really glad that this week is more than half way over   
"so right before i walked out the door this morning, i knew that i didn't have my phone and was like, hey can't forget to grab it     here i am at work, no phone   great "
so ready to be done working today    is there a reason that it feels like ever thursday takes forever?  ughhhhh     
i have decided that an ice cream sandwich is best eaten outside by a 1 and 2 year old        then straight inside for a bath!!  still love them tho     
"i had so much fun last night     i love love love thursday nights with the girls!!  as far as today goes    the quicker the better   i want my bed, immediately!"
"if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten     "
"so, i just went to take out the trash, and when i tried to go back inside the house, the door was locked    <propmale> deadbolted the door, (apparently he doesn't know how to unlock it) and both the kids were crying because they wanted to come outside, and all i wanted was to come in   needless to say, i had to climb through a window     "
"had an amazing lunch with my cousin, i just wish that it wasn't so short      so happy that i got to see her anyway!!"
i'm actually in a pretty good mood for a monday     must be the amazing bbq i went to last night!!

"i jsut spilled my coffee (from this morning) all over my desk, and all over me     i love being so graceful!"
"christina: what time are you leaving?\me: why, you want to go with me?\christina: no, i want you make brownies before you leave \omg        lmfao!!!"
"pretty sure i am so excited it's thursday, and it doesn't feel like i've been waiting forever for it   yay!!"

"i really hope that <propmale> is feeling better in the morning    i hate it when my kids don't feel good, so helpless!!"
"(sigh) instead of being at work, i'm at home, taking care of my sick kids, and cleaning the house   pretty sure i'd rather be at work!"
my kids are sick!!!  i hate it!  the worst part is <propmale> just barfed up his cold medicine   great     it could be a long night 
love that the giants won!!
