"class?  when did auburn get it? was is when your athletic director (at the time <propfirst> housel) goes on the radio and says he is coming for alabamaâ€™s children, and compares alabama to hitler and the naziâ€™s   there is no more class left in this rivalry    i am willing to bet that most of the auburn fans on here requesting class from alabama fans this year had a truck load of class for us last year "
nothing like a good old fashion bitter rivalry to get everyone worked up 
facebook   helping family and friends fight since 2004 smile 
"to all the classy auburn fans, congratulations on a great season   to the rest well   "
