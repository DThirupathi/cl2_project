"'arkham asylum: a serious house on serious e<propmale>h' has beautiful <propmale>, but is definitely not for the lighthe<propmale>ed  it was rather depressing, confusing at p<propmale>s, and insane   the end with batman and two-face was made of win, though "

"no, i'm not depressed!  i've just been wanting more hugs than normal   when i'm depressed i hide in my room for a few hours   i don't like being around people when i'm down   hugs require being around people, which requires not being depressed "

"every time someone tries to imply that batman and two-face both have split personalities, i die a little inside from the sheer stupidity   a secret identity is an orchestrated lie to protect one's true identity that the person has full control over and created consciously  a split personality is a coping mechanism for severe trauma that a person creates subconsciously and has no control over "

i just realized one of the secondary characters of the novel i wrote years ago carried a lucky coin he'd sometimes flip   *bangs head on desk* i    don't really know how to react to that   it doesn't sound like a trait i'd give one of my novel characters; i was sure i'd written him with a habit that fitted in the world i created  like fidgeting with a pocket knife  nope  he was a coin tosser  *bangs head on desk*
"arrrgh! i'm so sick of this cold! it's like i'm over it, but i'm still coughing and blowing my nose every other hour -- and my voice is still gone! *eats keyboard in frustration*"
