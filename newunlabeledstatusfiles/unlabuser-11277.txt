there comes a time when every life goes off course  in this desperate moment you must choose your direction  will you fight to stay on the path while others tell you who you are? or will you label yourself? will you be honored by your choice? or will you embrace your new path? each morning you choose to move forward or to simply give up
"at this moment there are 6,470,818,671 people in the world  some are running scared some are coming home  some tell lies to make it through the day others are just now facing the truth  some are evil men, at war with good and some are good, struggling with evil  six billion people in the world  six billion souls and sometimes -- all you need is one ???????"
"i  know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong  to measure yourself at least once  to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions  facing the blind death stone alone, with nothing to help you but your hands and your own head"
