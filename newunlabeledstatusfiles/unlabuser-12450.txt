listening to owl city  laugh 
"i've been looking in the mirror for so long, that i've come to believe my soul's on the other side  all the little pieces falling, shatter  shards of me too sharp to put back together, to small to matter, but big enough to cut me into so many little pieces  if i try and touch her i bleed, i bleed, and i breathe, i breathe no more "
i officially feel like a jerk    ugh  im going to try and get some sleep 
"how can i pretend that i don't see, what you hide so carelessly? i saw her bleed, you heard me breathe and i froze inside myself, and turned away    i must be dreaming  we all live, we all die, that does not begin to justify you  it's not what it seems, not what you think, no i must be dreaming  it's only in my mind, not real life, no i must be dreaming "
"sparkling grey, they're my own veins  any more than a whisper, any sudden movement of my heart, and i know, i know i'll have to watch them pass away  just get through this day, give up your way, you could be anything, give up my way, and lose myself, not today  that's too much guilt to pay  sickened in the sun, you dare tell me you love me, but you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die "
"once more i'll say goodbye to you, things happen but we don't really know why  if it's supposed to be like this, why do most of us ignore the <propmale> to miss  torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears i'm not feeling the situation  run away try to find that safe place you can hide it's the best place to be when you're feeling like, me! all these things i hate revolve around me  just back off before i snap "
tired from tennis    ugh    i think im going to go to bed real soon 
"evanescence-lose control you don't remember my name  i don't really care  can we play the game your way? can i really lose control? just once in my life, i think it'd be nice, just to lose control, just once, with all the pretty flowers in the dust  just once in my life, i think it'd be nice, just to lose control, just once  if i cut you down to a thing i can use, i fear there will be nothing good left of you "
"the first time i wont regret one look into your eyes and i'll never forget  but you're not about to jump right into this tonight  wondering just what to do, every single second in the room with you  i can't talk this over, to win you over, here tonight  so open your eyes, don't say goodnight, wondering why, alone tonight  i'll just let it go for you  i'm letting you down, you're just hiding it so well "
"what did the egg say to the boiling water? it'll be a minute before i get hard, i just got laid by a chick   "
i didn't even remember that school was tomorrow! thanks a lot for all those who had to announce that on here! lol
school kinda sucked    its all because i have chem   
gonna go to bed but not looking forward to chem    all the rest of my classes are pretty fun!
still awake working on understanding the first <propfemale> of 20 that we have to read for poly sci   
"stay low  soft, dark, and dreamless, far beneath my nightmares and loneliness  i hate me, for breathing without you  i don't want to feel anymore for you  grieving for you, i'm not grieving for you  nothing real love can't undo, and though i may have lost my way, all paths lead straight to you  i long to be like you, lie cold in the ground like you  halo, blinding wall between us  melt away and leave us alone again "
downloading a crap-load of evanescence songs
*sigh* i don't feel like doing anything today    and definately not looking forward to school tomorrow   annoyed 
wake up on your own  and look around you cuz you're not alone  release your high hopes and they'll survive  cuz this is the future and you are alive  dive in and swim away  from your loneliness and miserable days  and when you wake up on your own  look around you cuz you're not alone  let your hopes go and they'll survive  cuz this is the future and you are alive  you're headed home  you're headed home
