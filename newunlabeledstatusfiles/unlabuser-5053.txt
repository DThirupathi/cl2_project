"\a friend will be there for you when things are good   but a true friend will be there for you when things are good and also when things are very bad   and just when it feels like you will never smile again   they can put a smile on your face with just a hug!\"""""
"\friend derives from a word meaning \""free \"" a friend is someone who allows us the space and freedom to be \"""""
"\i hope you got all the answers and you've come to understand that people and things are always going to change and you can't stop them now \"""""
