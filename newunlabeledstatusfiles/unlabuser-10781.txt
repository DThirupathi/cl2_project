"i'll admit i'm a handful  unfortunately, most women won't repost this  i make mistakes, i am out of control and, at times, i'm hard to handleâ€”but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure as heck don't deserve me at my best  that's why it takes a real man to be able to put up with me (or keep up with me, for that matter!) repost if you're woman enough   or just that fabulous! lol"
