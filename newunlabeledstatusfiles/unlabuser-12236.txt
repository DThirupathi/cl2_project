"is in indianapolis  question: why do taxi drivers never know where they're going, even when you give them the most specific directions possible?"
"is having fun at indianapolis! with a heeeeeefty dose of stress, too  d: but for the most part, fun!"

"is anybody looking to buy a japanese wii? let me know, i have a friend who's looking to sell hers, and i can get you in contact~!"
dear giant two-day long headache of doom: don't you think it's time to leave me alone? you're making it difficult to function like a normal human being  unless normal human beings routinely turn off the lights and curl up under a blanket on the sofa for two days 
"starbucks salted caramel hot chocolate, where have you been all my life?"
downtown portland is creepy  both kinds  the good kind of creepy: getting ambushed by zombies outside of a mall  the bad kind of creepy: getting lost and accidentally wandering into a homeless park at night  i'm pleased to report that my brain is still intact (this was a concern of mine for both situations )

"dear stomach, i know you're hungry, but can you please stop making such a racket in the middle of assessment? of all my classes, you had to make your presence known in the quietest, of course  you're really not achieving anything by being such an irascible organ  thanks "
