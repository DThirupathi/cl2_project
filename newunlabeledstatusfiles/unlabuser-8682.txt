it feels so much like falling  dying while i wait to die  the fear of something or nothing  lonely empty lie  
"i can feel you all around me, thickening the air i'm breathing, holding on to what i'm feeling, savoring this heart that's healed "
i'll keep you my dirty little secret  love  (teehee  joyful  i love you!!)
ashes to ashes    we all fall down    heart-broken
