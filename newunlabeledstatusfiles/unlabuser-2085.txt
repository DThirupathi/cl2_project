"has learned the meaning of new years day, recovering from new years <propfemale> "
is starting to raise an eyebrow at a dear old chancellor  =|
"has never before witnessed any twit with worst timing than her  i mean come on, why now of all the bloody times in the world?"
"wow, already time for another three hour drive in the dead of night  well, who doesn't like midnight to early morning driving "
is highly amused  only a couple of days till the wheat crop comes in lol 
"has come to the understanding that there will never be a nice, relaxing three day weekend while in saginaw    annoyed \"
"ah hahaha, man, these past few days have been just absolute peaches, peaches from hell that were not even fit for <propfemale>'s table "
does not like looking at thw world at five in the bloody morning  > annoyed 
really does not find joy in rising at five in the morning and not sleeping till three the following morning on the behalf of work 
"what, in all of god's good names, am i doing up at seven in the bloody morning \\ annoyed "
"ah how sad, children should truly learn how to avoid having kids of their own "
"ok so perhaps hiking around out in hilly country right after eating a nice greasy burger, fries and a malt just is not the best thing to do at four in the afternoon "
loves how a 5 hour shift can suddenly turn into an 11 hour one 
"weary, tired and a little teary eyed "
"haha the glories of life, i don't have to go into work till 8 am tomorrow, much better than 6   smile "
ah back to the night shifts  what glorious ventures the night shall bring 
just had his ass saved tonight  ah thank god for those little blond women 
ah 19 rounds around the sun and yet i still am tempted to forget about the future so that i might indulge in the present  what youthful thinking 
ah the glories of matchmaking  who woulda guess she'd say sure?
"hahahaha, ah, me and the truck get to be reunited later today  smile  it's like i'm sixteen again "
"is rarely leaned towards anger, but some nights know just how to tick you off  > annoyed "
"ah hahaha, i nearly forgot, for every terrible event there can always be found one that makes up for it ten fold  never forget to search for the light around you   smile "
really hates the way he is reminded that his house is dominated by women 
"wow, district 9 was a bit more than i seriously e playful ected  awesome movie "
it's been a long time since i've been this disturbed  why in all of god's good names did they have to choose that particular time to pull up?
has returned to college station 
is back in the kitchen 
"ah the first day of school tomorrow with nothing but bio and nutrition till tuesday, thank the lord "
is now very irritated 
"haha, what better way to spend a night than learning all about <propmale> <propfirst> "
wonders when it suddenly became contreversial for a president to tell kids to stay in school?
horrah for animal nutrition tests  <propfemale> be to that which no one really pays attention to 
"well it's official, i can no longer claim any affection for owl "
"has never been to such an easy chem lab, if only there were more of them "
17hrs till an oh so wonderful o-chem test 
"so, i just got home from work, had to walk, now i have a bio test in five and a half hours after which i have to write up a organic chem lab report after which i have a bloody pre-vet meeting  and after all of this i get to close again on thursday only to take nutrition test on friday  maybe i'll get some sleep saturday after work "
"i am tired and kinda worn out, yet i can't help but grin at the weekend "
"has been beaten, torn, sullied and worn(too literally), and still has a freakin 8am class in 3 hours "
alkene reactions and o-chem tests can just go to hell
time to settle in for a night of bio and o-chem lab  ah the joys of college
"haha to think, i may be getting a roomy next year "
really just does not like the animal kingdom anymore 
"haha, yea i still got it "
"ok, so apprently women still like to call you at random times at night to talk about life in general   note taken "
"ah, work till two and wake up at seven, what a glorious life "
"ah, it's always amusing to go out to drink at bars "
"if anyone could get me the names of those damn twits that invented owl homework for o-chem, that would be just lovely "
"not even a full day back in saginaw and already i am being reminded how easily things can fly right under my nose without me being suspicious in the slightest  ah, what a tragedy to look at opportunities passed  still 3 more days to go   annoyed \"
on the road again 
really is not impressed with o-chem lab at the moment
shall be back on the roads within the hour  oh the <propfemale> of night driving 
haha god i love taken
just learned how one may be ambushed by text messages 
"and so he walked forth into a room of sorrow and pain, looking down upon an organic chemistry test that took a semester to forge "
and thus it was over 
"oh <propmale> bay, why hath thou  forsaken the land which i am bound to"
"shall be back in saginaw by roughly around midnight  ah, just in time for the <propfemale> of the <propfemale> of christmas"
finally got a new phone 
startin on his northward journey 
has finally seen the light of his ultimate dream  love may not soon come to my door step but the right to practice medicine shall not soon be denied to me now!
i really bloody well hate when logic flies in the face of my stubborn will 
just turned his f'ing day around  score!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is fluctuating
"quote of my day, \don't look at my butt \"" thanks for the snap back to reality from the radio crazy stammering women """
"tonight study organic chemistry and entomology, tomorrow drive, work then study some more  oh what a truly grand weekend "
i think i just remembered why i'm not fond of subway 
"shall not soon waiver in his resolve, even if it means inviting the anger of others "
"turkey, <propfemale> oat bread and those wierd sun chips are henceforth banned from my apartment "
haha never would have guessed the chasm between animal rights and animal welfare
"ah done with school by ten, home by one, kinda tipsy by twelve, gotta love this friday "
"hahaha, and thus spring break was slightly spent studying, what an interesting flip"
"great food, great company, great night "
"back to college station, back to reality"
ah the glories of dealing with dumbasses that apprently don't realize that you need to make wide turns when hauling a f'ing boat 
"hazaa, the meds have stopped working and the pain has returned!"
really gotta love those talks about how life is gonna screw you in a few weeks and about how it will probably screw you in a few years 
ah what i'd give only for twenty four hours from now 
and thus exams were over
really needs some good news right about now 
ah when shall my enigma be solved? when shall the reason for her smile be illuminated?
there but for the grace of you go i 
"and i think to myself, what a wonderful world "
hazaa for wearing  scrubs  what glorious days at the clinic 
oh how i miss those three weeks 
"ah, can't wait for monday"
just about twenty more hours till my day off  ah i can just smell the rum around the corner 
"beware, tumors tend to spurt out large amounts of blood"
12 days left
i believe i just saw a commercial advertising infedelity 
ah if only i could suture legs all day
"well, i'm old"
i think i need to open a <propfemale> office
off to college station tomorrow 
by god if they took my records i'll hunt them all down
well i'd say fml certainly covers this one
"another day off tomorrow, why oh why does relaxation have to come at such heavy prices?"
and thus ended any respect left for fox news left in the world 
and so it begins again 
math just isnt as fun as i remember
i think my dream catcher needs to be cleaned out
i think i may have to start a coup at work  \\ annoyed 
"i really hate wet, old, decaying organic matter "
is apparently a hopeless romantic 
"hazaa, i finally found out why specintomycin affects the subunit r-protein 30s during translation and not the subunit r-protein 50s  to think it all has to due with lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycan and not any ribosomal pathway or structure  and if you understood any of this well then, you probably need a few drinks too "
"ha the night started off with someone asking me where i was from due to my apparent accent and ended with a mug of lemon rum with dragons, is there anything more lovely than that?"
"nap, then test, then quiz, then nap"
"test, work, test, homework, long nap"
just 6 more hours till i hit the road
"i saw a shooting <propfemale> and, for the first time, i didn't know what to wish for "
i do believe i have been dumped without so much as a long distant phone call 
i'd give a damaged left arm for just one more credit hour 
"huh, i knew it, urban living is bad for your mind "
and now on to those damn enuch lovers haha 
"off work early, well kinda "
"ah, it feels pretty damn good to be in saginaw with my couch"
ah shoppin on black friday   
why am i bloody well taking care of drunk people over twice my age?
i shall never step into another chem lab again!
"ah my soul aches, not for someone but for something"
"i've been studying amino acids for the past 2 hours, i now believe it is time to study the alcohol functional groups in rum and vodka "
"by god, being in an er is one of the most boring places on earth "
and so begins my four day vacation
"bah, my hatred of people seems only to swell when i am at work "
"ha the heater is finally getting to run in my apartment, meaning im living in 50 degree waether  i think i need thicker socks to remain comfortable "
i need something more than fast food tonight
