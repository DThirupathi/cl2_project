"the constitution pretty much just screwed over the deceleration of independence  it pretty much took the right that we thought we were going to get and cut them off so if the government becomes corrupt we will have to stand aside, and if anyone want to stop the corruption they will have no legal right  all they can do is sign a petition or protest  which gets nothing done "
"nationality is bs  they(the white house specifically <propfirst> bush jr ) took our rights! the patriot act sounds like an act that is for the good of the country  this was after september 11, 2001 what it really is, is an act that allows to arrest, prosecute, and torture a \suspected terrorist\"" """
this means even if you are not a terrorist you can be treated as one  this seems like something hitler did after the reichstag building (where the parliment worked) and declared a simular act 
yeah nationality is bs!
yeah

i feel out of my time  the processes of the modern world are slow and ireliable  of course we hve advanced greatly in the thousands of years we have been here i think this is not how it will stay  i believe that soon things will change even if i must change them 
i got sunburned  pretty sure that even my ees are sunburned  i actually didn't notice or even think about it 
now i see why i don't usually do all the stuff i want in the begining  theres nothing left to do for the rest of the time 
"why do people strive to feel good  at the end of it all you end up wanting it, and when you don't have it you feel bad  for what? a moment or two of actual joy? and then what? just fall into the cycle of being sad because you want it and it gets harder to obtain  it just spirals out of control until your life ends up crashing and burning!"
are we really wired to be this bad at planning ahead that we only feel  good when actually performing an action that brings you joy? this was  the way it was designed  it keeps the human will and might  going  as long as you know that at the end you will have accomplished  something and that it will be different people will go through this  cycle until they notice that sometimes nothing gets accomplished 
"why do people not display there religous or political view on there profiles, and when they do they follow the rules and just put something like  christian - catholic"
"why is my life like this!?!? i'm not really that normal, of course i would never want to be  i would rather find myself dead  i am glad that i am more concious about my surrondings  i wouldn't like to be normal "
just watched saw 5  plot got better and it is very interesting 
got smash bros  brawl on sunday  pretty fun  it seems i can't find anything to do  it is most likely because so little intrests me at the moment  i'm not going to say i can't wait till (time) or then i would be lying because i actually don't have much to look forward to this week 
just broke into my own house and my dog attacked me lol  i need a key

finally chose to use facebook on my phone 
i've noticed that the best thing i do is think  for some reason i find myself thinking about things that are completely unrelative  sometimes i'll be talking to someone and think of something entirely diffrent and still be attached to the conversation  sometimes i lose sight of reality and become delusional

you are more likely to die in a bike(1 in 4147) accident then in a plane accident(1 in 5862)  also more likely to die in a car passenger accident(1 in 272)  and from falling(1 in 184)  as well as a car accident of any kind(1 in 85)  so if you are brave enough to drive a car you should be able to get on a plane without thinking that you will die
