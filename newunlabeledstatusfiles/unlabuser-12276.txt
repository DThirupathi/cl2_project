just spent 4 hours working on band accounts -- ugh! time for a break 
didn't realize facebook was going to be such a commitment -- i just responded to more than 30 pending requests  maybe vikie is right and i have sent too many friend requests    
"my first facebook block  should i really be surprised that it was a kleinsmith \friend\""?"""
jazz police     nothing like a great goodwin big phat band tune to top your evening - especially when your kid is in the band  solid 
heard an awesome concert today  there was this group of high school students playing some incredible concert band music and     hey! that's <propmale> on alto sax!
looking forward to the circuit assembly this weekend  guaranteed to be just what i need  praying my heart will be open to receive it all and act on it 
<propmale>'s missouri all-state honor band concert is tomorrow  hope to get a good recording to share with anyone who can't make it 
"got to all-state venue about 12:45     choir is performing     jazz is at 1 smile 0 and concert band at 2 smile 0     gonna get great seats i think to myself     foolish man! even after choir parents leave there must be 300 people already waiting for band! fortunately, found exactly 5 seats 8 rows back  the bands were amazing  even better than e playful ected  and, of course, my child was the  most  amazing   smile "
"faith is personal, but not private  woe would be me had jesus and the apostles thought such "
why do most of my family members show up in the facebook family list without pictures or links? have they all blocked me? (not that i'd blame them    )
