if i had a world of my own everything will be nonsense nothing will be what it is because everything will be what it is not
i invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time  and every creature lens themselves to change your state of mind  and the girl that <propmale> the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill  has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels  to stand outside your virtue  no one can ever hurt you  or so they say  her name is <propfemale>
sometimes the curiosity can kill the soul but leave the pain  and every ounce of innocence is left inside the brain  and through the looking glass we see she's faithfully returned  but now off with her head i fear is everyones concern  you see theres no real ending  its only the beginning (her name is <propfemale>)
"so     i love <propfemale> and gaga      but im gonna have to say <propfemale> is the down ass bitch                  >>>right after my down-ass-bitch girlfriend but , just sayin   wink "

change only happens when the pain of holding on is greater than the fear of letting go 
having a resentment is like drinking poison and e playful ecting someone else to die
"\fear is a darkroom for developing negatives\"""""
"if you do not know where you are going, then any road will take  you there "
