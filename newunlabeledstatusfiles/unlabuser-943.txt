"you know, going to my grandfather's funeral today really put some things in perspective for me; and i've truly realized that god and family are the two most important things in a persons life  when so called friends stab you in the back, they will always be there!!!"
"whether a relationship, friendship, or a career, never waist your time on something you know does not feel right from the start! you'll just end up dissatisfied "
"just finished running two <propmale>, i'm sleepy  now it's time to take a shower and chill out for a bit "
"just because situations get complicated, it doesn't mean you should give up  the race isn't given to the swift, but the ones who endure "
"it's funny how people use the hell out of you and then talk about you behind your back, then when you confront them they deny it, one thing my parents have always instilled in me is that if your man enough to talk shit about someone behind their back, be man enough to say it to their face "
"man, i hate people who are so stuck on themselves "
"if you believe in god repost this! please don't ignore, you are being tested  for it says in the bible, \deny me in front of everyone and i will deny you in front of my father \"" 97% won't repost this  will you? i am not ashamed! i want everyone to know that jesus christ lives in my heart"""
really thinking about staying in nc for my senior year
"man, some people can be soooo disrespectful, and they push you to the limit "
"man, summer came and went too fast, seems like just yesterday i was a freshman  ready to move on to the next phase of my life       college "
it feels good to finally be home
"man, i'm buggin, only three more days until school starts "
"if there's one piece of advice i could share with all the younger kids out there it would be to never conform to anyones e playful ectations but your own, yes it's good to follow directions when necessary, but when you conform to everyone else's e playful ectations, you begin to lose your own"
wishing i had another week off right now

"god is good just got accepted to odu, one more reply to go!!!"
