"you're always in a phase  if you weren't then you wouldn't be learning from whatever life lessons that have been coming your way  hence, you're always learning as well  people forget that when they get older "
what a beautiful summer day!
"there's nothing like ungodly hot weather, a baking car, and standstill traffic on the bridge "
there's nothing like going out to get the mail barefoot and stepping on poop that's hidden in your lawn  that nice squishy sensation between your toes 
"if the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark  dark would be without meaning  - c  s  <propfirst>"
one more miserable day and it's over
