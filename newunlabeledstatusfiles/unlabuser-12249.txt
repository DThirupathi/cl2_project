is anything really ever worth it?
i've decided i dont  like running at night
do one thing every day that scares you 
heres to alcohol; the cause and solution to all of life's problems   
"if there was only water here, i think this place could be amazing"
its amazing how much you can learn about somebody when you just let them talk 
stupid tv  be more funny 
it's official   i hate dust 
never thought i'd miss alcohol this much!
this iraqi heat is giving me headaches!   sad 
all work and no play makes me a dull boy
dazed and confused 
"if anybody else asks me about leave, i think i might snap "
"i just keep telling myself: \its another day at the beach    its another day at the beach \""  damn   where's the f@%$ing water!"""
challenging my video animation skills   
"\has anyone seen my <propfirst> varvato's ipod case?\"""""
i need to stop talking to people who barely speak english   i'm starting to speak in broken   irregular sentences   
this iraqi wind is horrible 
is all wee-weed up 
i dont like running on treadmills     they hurt!  not like running on the road at all 
is it bad to say 118f is a cool day?
i really hate dust 
"another day, another dollar "
somehow surviving each day 
today was monday?
another long day 
gearing for another day   i hope nobody throws a wrench in it 
"maturity is a bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to remedy anything   - <propmale> vonnegut"
another day down   and another day closer to halloween 
"forgot how much i liked the movie \the replacements\"""""
is seriously considering to purchase the 2010 <propfirst> 
is bleh today   not looking forward to the flu shot tomorrow 
flu shot sucks   
"hates when he puts something away so he does not lose it, and then forgets where he put it  ugh!"
i heard a rumor that iraq is hot   it was only hot for a couple days   i think kuwait is warmer than this 
really needs a good halloween costume idea!
anybody living in the <propmale> area   ?  i need a favor   
"if anybody can figure out how to get a <propfirst> o'lantern out here in iraq, please tell me!"
"deep into the darkness peering, long i stood there, wondering, fearing,doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before "
â€œwhiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting overâ€�
work   work 
beware of the light at the end of the tunnel   it could be headlights of oncoming traffic 
living the dream!  one nightmare at a time   
nothing like taking a pt test after being awake for 2 days straight 
waiting for the great pumpkin!
this is going to be a really long week!   annoyed 
going to bed early tonight   its going to be a long day   
accomplished absolutely nothing 
not looking forward to iraqi winter
"first box sent out today   its now official, the moving process has begun!"
finally some rain in iraq 
"am i the only one enjoying the extra \breathing room\""?"""
totally forgot what highspeed internet is   information overload pending  
snow in kansas   roads closed   offices shutdown   im stuck in my room wondering when i'll get to eat breakfast   how is this any better than iraq?!
the laundry list of things to do is slowly decreasing in size   hallelujah!
first real weekend in the us  off to a good start 
xmas disneyland   quite an e playful erience   highly suggested 
day 1 in ga   everything is closed for the holidays   house hunting postponed til monday 
really wants this move to be over with!
finally got cable and internet   these bare walls were starting to close in on me!
can i go now?  my brain is full 
spent all last night unpacking 2000 lbs of equipment that arrived from cali   my body aches!   definitely do not look forward to work today!
cant believe colt is out   can the freshman step up?
why am i so sleepy!
"almost finished unpacking   been out of the loop for the last couple weeks   this dust will settle soon   never move and start working at the same time, its more stress than its worth   but i'm definitely diggin the new atmosphere!  the south is much better than i remember!"
last work day of the week begins at 330am   have i ever mentioned how much i enjoy the army?  what other institution provides you with so many opportunities to wake up so early?  i bet some of you didn't even know that time existed before 6am 
just ordered my nexus one 
got my nexus one   its pretty powerful 
is completely apathetic 
meh  
it requires less character to discover the faults of others than it does to tolerate them 
dont bother me this weekend   im not interested 
how much alcohol can i cram into 1 weekend?  hmmmm   
"i swear i didnt drink a drop last night, but this hangover is telling me otherwise   "
am i getting that old already?  college and hs reunion this year   
last day of the week   cant wait!
snow???!?
looks like i'll be waking up to snow tomorrow 
so does anybody actually use myspace anymore?   i wonder if i should even keep my account active anymore 
very disappointed with boondock saints 2
high humidity tonight   sux 
"\im going to ask one of the hooters girls if she was a girl scout and if she says yes then im going to ask her what shes gonna do for me since she's owes me after all those cookies \""  -my instructor in class"""
"ice cold milk and an oreo cookie,  they forever go together, what a classic combination "
let the good times roll 
"whats up with the recent increase in video bloggers?  you arent funny, witty, or insightful   quit wasting my time!"
hey!  there's another contradiction!  the albino lifeguard!!
