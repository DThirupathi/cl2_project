"well, between the room being 90 degrees, the tv flashing strobe lights and playing rock music, and that stupid cell phone chiming every five minutes    looks like i'm not sleeping again tonight  and people get annoyed with me for sleeping all day  i guess i need to get used to not having an opinion    no one cares about it anyway "
"is done playing nice  all year, i've compromised and compromised  all year, i've adapted to other people's needs to avoid drama, while everyone else ignored my opinions, and made fun of the way i am  i'm done with that  now its the <propfemale> show  i am who i am  like it or go away  i'm over it "
sigh    mozart makes everything better  smile  all i need now is choir and a good night's sleep and i may be able to regenerate my soul 
    you make my dopamine levels go all silly   laugh 
it is impossible to love and be wise
