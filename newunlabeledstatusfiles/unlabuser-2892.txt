curious - is facebook now requiring personal e-mail acceptance of application notifications in order to receive and send gifts ??
"i have tried 3 days in a row to send \recruit mafia\"" (big black m version) invitations to all my friends who have the application (!!) - is the \""send invite\"" feature working for everyone else or is it out of service ???"""

my mafia members: update wish lists if you need to - if i have it i'll send it      new members - you will get your daily energy pack tomorrow (it's been sent for today)
i may have finally figured out the correct way to send receive mafia wars respect mail - still learning the ends & outs of this game (collect respect from inside the game or you don't get the bonus   i think - lol)
mafia wars friends - i'm helping everyone i can (!!) - lots of bonus opportunities to be picked up off my profile wall that reward you but do not cost you anything -
