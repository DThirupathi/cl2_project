<propmale> fucking migraine   not enough excedrin in the world to stop it ugh  sad 
im starting to see that love is played out and obviously doesnt have as strong a meaning anymore and i hate that   i hate love  it makes you feel so vulnerable then slaps you in the face because for a split second you let your guard down and were actually happy for the first time in a lone time  i really should invest in waterproof mascara!

"you make me smile for no reason whatsoever, you make me laugh at unfunny things, but my favorite thing is most of all, you make me love you and there is no e playful lanation why   i just do   smile "
people need to think before they say things! you really think you know someone till they open their mouth and say something totally idiotic! way to be a true friend! ill remember this

"finally i have found a place into which i fit perfectly â€¦ safely and securely with no doubts, no fears, no sadness, no tears  this place is filled with happiness and laughter, yet it is spacious enough to allow me the freedom to move around â€¦ to live my life by myself  this wonderful place, which i never believed, really existed, i have finally found â€¦ in your arms, in your heart, in your love "

"love? we think about it, sing about it, dream about it, lose sleep worrying about it  when we don't have it, we search for it; when we discover it, we don't know what to do with it; when we have it, we fear losing it  it is the constant source of pleasure and pain  be we can't predict which it will be from one moment to the next  it is a short word, easy to spell, difficult to define, impossible to live without "
