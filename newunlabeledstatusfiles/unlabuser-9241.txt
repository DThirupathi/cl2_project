"it's doppelgÃ¤nger week   during this week please change your profile picture to someone famous (actor ,musician, athelete) you have been told you look like     be sure to post this as your status "
"i have to get out of the house today and go to the gym   the snow is pretty, but it can melt now and warm up to 80 degrees and i would be happy   <propfemale> keeps begging to go to grandma's cuz she is bored too "
"just noticing how my house has become a zoo   i have one dog sitting next to me gnawing on a bone, one cat sitting next to me snoozing, one cat lying on the couch, and the other dog is playing with gilly   i would have never thought i would have this many pets since i am a clean freak, but i sure love them "
"life's getting a little stressful with these dogs   this housetraining thing apparently is not my thing   i am having to hire a dog trainer   talked to one trainer that uses shock collars and i thought it was cruel at first, but now it seems like it is not a bad idea!!  i should have just stuck with my 2 wonderful cats "
"today was a beautiful day, but why does it have to get cold again?  it is amazing how much a nice <propfemale> day can lift your spirits "
took off early today b c i wasn't feeling well   too much stress=sick   i know better   took a great nap and now i am going to do a little homework   i am sitting in the afternoon sunshine shining through the windows and smelling the orange blossoms from my tree   very pleasant i must say 
"i hate being sick   i do find it interesting though how illness brings us back to our most basic level   vanity is out the door   i haven't taken a shower, brushed my teeth, changed out of my pj's, or anything   just sitting here with a tissue stuck up my nose cuz it won't stop running   it sucks "
feeling much better today   taking an antibiotic   i have learned to just give up the natural health kick when it comes to sinus infections   the thought of no sinus infections sure makes florida sound great   never had a one the whole time we lived there 
"should be at work, but i am at home instead   we have been slow at work   anyone need any physical therapy?"
it is amazing how doors just open up at the right time   life just seems to be falling into place 
"just sitting here trying to think of something to talk about, but nothing comes to mind   i suppose that is better than being stressed out, mad, or sad   life is just kinda rolling along right now   being content is a nice feeling "
"just got back from vacation   some time at the beach and disney world and most importantly time with friends   of course it would have been more fun had my husband not been laid off during the vacation   yes, that's right   no one ever said life is boring or if they did they lied!!!"
florida here i come!!  can't wait to be a floridian again   i suppose i will always be an okie at heart though 
"house showing is going great   the house went on the mls friday, we showed the house twice yesterday and 2 more are coming today   that may increase as the day goes on   people are really looking   keeping my fingers crossed   that will be one less stressor to sell fast "
we are in contract with selling the house with a full price offer   we are now packing and preparing for the big moving day next wednesday  it will be here soon!!
woke up last night   it was 2 smile 0 a m  and my husband was not in bed   got up to search for him and he was not at home   panic!! he had left at 10 smile 0 for wal-mart for boxes   i was about to call the hospital when i realized he had taken my cell phone   called him and he was fine   he had came home then went back to get the boxes at 2 surprise 0   just made me realize how much i love him 
moving sure makes you tired   we are finally here in florida   gilly is having a good time and is making a lot of friends already   i have a feeling we will be going to the pool everyday if she has her way 
kinda interesting that we move away from oklahoma and a tornado hits 2 <propmale> from our house   is it a sign?
"so sunburned today!!  went to the beach yesterday and did not put on sunscreen cuz i was under the umbrella, but apparently that was not good enough   ouch!!  gilly is sunburned too - poor baby and we put sunscreen on her   combo of further south and global warming is not good "
"had fun today at the parade   i miss my family, holidays are hard when you are used to getting together with family   luckily i have inherited a good family here in florida thanks to my friend <propfemale>!"
"i feel like the worst parent ever   gilllian is sunburned again!!!  she is blistered on her face and right shoulder   i bought zinc and bullfrog so maybe this won't happen again   we are all sunburned, but it was worth it   had a blast at the beach yesterday   waves were quit big and lets just say i swallowed a lot of saltwater getting hit and pulled under   this is why i moved here   paradise "
"went to adventure island yesterday and had a blast   <propfemale> went down a few slides w  the tube, but she mostly liked the spray park areas and the small kiddie slide   used bullfrog and none of us got sunburned, thank goodness "
"another fun day at siesta beach yesterday   today cleaning, errands, and taking my husband to buy a fishing pole for some salt water fishing with the boys next week   he is so excited!  happy father's day to all the dads out there "
it sure is nice when life treats you good   sometimes i have to wonder why my life has turned out so well and others just seem to suffer all the way through   kinda makes me scared that at some point my luck will run out!
<propmale> the builder (yes our builder is named <propmale>)  has officially started on our house   they are planning to pour the foundation next thursday   it is amazing how fast it goes when someone else builds it   at this rate it may be ready in october 
had fun at sea world today   the dolphin show made me cry   animals amaze me and to see how amazingly talented and smart they are made me happy and sad that they are dying because of the idiots at bp 
had a great day at work today   i laughed so much that my abs hurt   i work with 2 really funny guys   i love working somewhere where i can laugh and have a good time 
"well, it appears it is going to be a very rainy day here   i even looked to see if we could travel to miami or <propmale> and avoid the rain   no luck there either   i guess we will have to suffer like our okie friends "
"went to yoga tonight and realized i may have great balance, but my flexibility really, really sucks!"
"i can't wait to get my house   please hurry <propmale> the builder   apartment living is ok as long as you don't have roaches and fleas, which ours does   so i am not too happy about living in a \nice\"" apartment and paying to live with the critters that should be outside!"""
went to play at a park by the manatee river   we walked to the river and <propfemale> asked if there was oil in the water   told her not yet and lets hope there never is   it would be heartbreaking 
went to sea world again last night and the fireworks were amazing   <propfemale> was so tired on the drive home and she kept saying she just wanted to be asleep in her bed   of course it didn't stop her from waking up at 8 smile 0 this morning 
"i love what i do   i had a patient thank me today with tears in her eyes for giving her some pain relief for the first time in 16 years   wow, what a cool job i have "
"who has heard of the vibram 5 fingers?  for anyone who has not tried them, they are amazing   they feel like you are walking barefoot and it is crazy how much you feel your feet and arch working   stop buying the fancy \corrective\"" shoes and just buy something that makes the foot work properly   i highly recommend them """
"had a good day at work, came home to dinner my hubby made, followed by relaxation in the pool   quite nice and so much different than it used to be   it is so nice to have a relaxing life again "
"went to <propmale> e cheese with <propfemale>   gotta love spending $10 for 2 tootsie rolls, 1 airhead, 1 <propfemale> sucker, and a sticker   which in reality should cost about a dollar   oh, well it was fun anyway   but the food, wow, i am not sure that it could get any worse "
"i love reading a good analytical book   figured out that i am a mix of choleric and melancholic, while <propfirst> and <propfemale> are phlegmatic   so basically i like control and perfection in my life, while the other 2 just don't give a crap!"
went to the pier in st <propmale> last night   we ate at cha cha coconuts and had ice cream   tonight     the goo goo dolls!!
"so <propfemale> went down a blow up water slide at the y and hurt her back   she had some muscle spasms that i needed to release   i may do physical therapy every day, but it is nothing like trying to keep a squirmy 5 year old still to stretch her!  but i succeeded!"
about to go camping for the night on the beach   we have to take the kayak to get to the key so it should be interesting to say the least 
"ok, we are back from camping   overall it went well   we all took the kayak over then <propfirst> had to make one more trip for the equipment   but i just can't sleep well when camping so i am tired   we saw dolphins, spider crabs, and plenty of birds "
"so much has been going on, but i have not been been updating anyone   so here goes   gilly loves soccer and school, buying new furniture and decor for the house which we close on in 9 days, got a promotion at work, making new girlfriends, and loving my unemployed hubby!!!  think that covers it!"
"not feeling well today   i have been taking every supplement i have and resting   not getting any worse, but not getting any better either   now for the big decision, do i go to work tomorrow and potentially make things worse by not resting or do i cancel all my patients who depend on me to make them feel better   that is one thing i don't like about my job!!"
"closed on our house today!!  so happy to finally be moving out of this apartment   even though it was only 5 months it seemed like an eternity   neighbors are so nice, everyone waves at you when you drive around   we saw a 5 foot gator in the lake too "
got everything important moved to the new house   we are about to go to the pool and see if there are any kids for gilly to play with   maybe this evening we will just sit on the lanai and look at the lake and relax!!
"i am always amazed at how life is so uncertain and why tough times in life can either make you stronger or break you   to friends that have suffered losses, to friends that are moving away   i wish you all the best "
nothing like having a babysitter that lives next door   awesome!!
just got back from sea world spooktacular   not quite what i e playful ected   it was hot and busy so it felt like going during the summer and there was not that much new to see   <propfemale> had fun though and she got to watch the sesame street countdown to halloween show so she was happy 
"bought some new plants and palms to plant   i love landscaping   course, i like it even better when my husband digs the holes and plants everything!  i just tell him where to put it "
my husband finally got a job   now hopefully he will pass the drug test   he has been sitting around the house for months now and things just don't seem to get done during the day and he has really had the munchies because he has ate a lot of <propfemale>'s halloween <propfemale>   i'm just sayin'  smile 
bedlam weekend here we come!! put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a oklahoma state fan!! being a cowboy fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously!! there is still no known cure for it and sympathy does not help  but we can raise awareness!! 100% of ou fans will repost this   simply because we know how to copy and paste     as well as tie our shoes!!-boomer     sooner!!!
<propfirst> has been in line at toys r us for 3 hours with another 40 minutes to go   we will save like $150 if he gets all he sets out to get   this is one of those times it is great to live where it is 75 degrees out instead of 30!
"went to st <propmale> beach   not too many people so there were dolphins, seagulls, and pelicans everywhere!  makes me feel so connected with nature to share it with them   can't understand how people can overlook the beauty all around us "
i am so lucky to work with a great group of people   this is the first time that i have liked everyone that i work with and that is really rare   some days i laugh so hard and just have a great time   awesome!
all the ducks are flying here!!!
florida is not feeling so tropical tonight   we are going to be hovering just above freezing   hope my plants make it through!
nothing like being criticized for not doing something that you were never told to do in the first place 
"it is good to be home   it was nice to be with family on christmas, but tgif (thank goodness it's florida)   been outside most of the day so far, it is perfect weather out   so thanks to all my family for hospitality and good memories and i will see all of you soon "
"tonight my daughter rubbed my feet, legs, and arms with lotion   then massaged my shoulders   she said she wanted to do something nice for me since i am so good to her   it is amazing how as mothers we always feel like we are not quite good enough   but times like this tell me i am doing something right   i sure love her "
"brother's week! if you have a brother who has made you laugh, made you cry, held you when others made you cry, punched you, stuck up for you, drove you crazy, hugged you, watched you succeed, watched you fail, and never says i told you so, saw you fall, picked you up, cheered you on, made you strong, and is someone you can't live without    copy and paste this to your status "
"i have not been on facebook much lately, but it sounds like all of my facebook friends are sick   sorry everyone and i hope everyone gets well soon!!!!"
i love landscaping   it is so much fun planning out beds and deciding on what plants to plant   we are e playful anding our beds and moving palm trees   everything is really starting to grow   can't wait for everyone to see!!
just looking through pictures and i feel sad that i don't get to concentrate on my family more   time is going by so fast and my gilly is growing up   do all parents feel like you just don't spend as much time with your kids as you should?
the air is filled with the smell of orange blossoms   it is my favorite smell in the whole world!!  i wish i could bottle it and send to my okie friends and family 
"i heard the sonic boom today from the shuttle returning to earth   it was quite loud and shook the building   it passed directly over sarasota, where i work "
"<propfemale> said she was proud of me and <propfirst> because we take care of her   she then said that i am not as proud of myself as i should be, like she knows that i wonder if i am doing a good job as a mother   she never ceases to amaze me with her insight and comprehension of things way beyond her years   i am so proud of her "
just watched 2 male bald eagles hunt for small ducks in the lake behind our house   they kept dive bombing and the ducks kept going under   the eagles finally tired out and the sun went down so they left   those ducks were amazing because it lasted about 10 minutes   i bet the eagles must have babies   i was so stressed out!
"feeling so lonely tonight   i lost my sweet baby girl   she was always with me   as i am going through my normal evening routine, i am realizing that she is not sitting on the counter next to me while i wash my face or waiting for me to go to bed so she can snuggle by my legs   she spent more time with me than anyone else   i am really going to miss her purr   love you baby girl and thank you for 8 wonderful years "
"there comes a point in your life when 'fun' no longer means bar hopping ,clubbing and being out until 4 am or drinking to much  it means movies,going out for family dinners,bed time stories and sleeping at 8pm  becoming a parent doesnt change you   it makes you realize that the little people you've created deserve the best of your free time! repost this if you are proud to be a parent and love your \boring\"" life"""
"it is a cruel joke that i am so allergic to animals   i should say some animals, well actually just some of one type of animal and not others   it is confusing to me too?!!  we got another cat to replace our baby girl   she is the sweetest thing ever, but she is bothering my allergies   i am going to have to take her back   figaro (boo boo), our other cat, will be happy   he hates her!"
