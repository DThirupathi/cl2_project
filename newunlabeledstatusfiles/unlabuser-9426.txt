anyone in galesburg interested in going to coffee tuesday? give me a call if you're interested!
has to start packing so she can move to michigan soon    this is weird 
"is going to officially move to mt pleasant tomorrow, though the furniture won't be there for another two weeks   "
made it to michigan in one piece and is as moved in as she can be without furniture!
"is going to be in colorado springs from tomorrow until sunday to pack up her life  if you're around and want to <propfemale> out, give her a call!"
is wondering if there's anyone still around in the springs or if everyone has already left   
"is almost done packing her life  unfortunately, the bookshelf is the task to be tackled tomorrow   "
is getting on the road to michigan just as soon as she finds coffee!!
"made it to michigan and is currently making things look pretty! two rooms down, two to go  also, food is becoming necessary   "
done with the moving settling in and waiting for classes to start monday  where did summer go?
"survived day one, but is really sleepy    reading may have to turn into a marathon tomorrow if i want to actually get anything out of it "
just commenced a counter attack against yellow jackets with her vacuum cleaner!
is going to bed regardless of party status in the apartments around her  hopefully a sleeping pill will solve that problem   
has one class today and then is getting out of dodge for a real weekend (i e  minimal work for grad school)!
is back to the daily grind
is at a loss to create interesting statuses   maybe if there were more sleep and less work her brain would function?
"it does not change everything we know about evolution and human history when we find skulls that show evidence of early homo erectus in tbilisi  it changes one fact about one species out of billions  even if this one fact is important, it doesn't overturn decades of research into any of those other species or even most of the other hominins!"
"likes when papers are specific as to their definitions  for example, \normative understanding of post-pubertal heterosexual rape\"" as opposed to the one word \""rape\"" that most other papers would probably use """
last first exam of grad school (if that makes any sense)    here's hoping it goes more like history than physio!
adopted a 7 month old kitten today  check out the new album if you want to see pictures!

rain = halloween in <propfemale> arbor  a good time will be had by all!
"actually, it looks like it'll be halloween in mt pleasant after all!"
"if i were still at knox, the term would almost be over  as it is, i just finished the second round of midterms    over a month left does not equal happy <propfemale> "
michigan weather seems to sap me of my motivation to do things such as homework  hopefully this will change before i get too far behind   
only halfway failed at baking cookies! this is quite the accomplishment as anyone who has ever seen the products of previous attempts can attest  only a couple are transparent and there's even one batch of semi-fluffy cookies!!
wishes she had more motivation to study for her exam tomorrow   
just wrote a 21 <propfemale> term paper in two days  take that grad school 
"eviscerated her term paper tonight, but managed to cut it down a bit which was the goal!"
it appears michigan likes me about as much as i like it  at least we agree!
finally heading to illinois!!!
"is heading into the final stretch    if i have failed to call or write recently, that's why  e playful ect contact after the 7th "
when did december happen? and why am i still in classes?
beat the physio paper into submission and now just has finals to study for  if only the snow would go away

survived the first semester of grad school! now to go into a coma for a while

feels old    i spent the afternoon cleaning the apartment to light jazz 
just spent the night reading about sem and path analysis  now it's off to read a cookbook before bed!
"thinks  apa is silly, especially when trying to find all the necessary information to cite doctoral dissertations   "

"probably shouldn't have turned on the olympics, but the figure skaters are so pretty and sparkly    real work can totally get done during commercial breaks, right?"
is going to try actually sleeping tonight and see if that improves the motivation to work tomorrow   
thought i was unproductive until i looked at my schedule and realized i did everthing i wanted to do today  it's an odd feeling   
"spending the day with the lancet, my thesis, and a midterm  i've had better fridays   "
"two questions for the day: 1) why does the cat only want to be pet when you're not petting her, and 2) why are motivation to work and workload always inversely related?"
"i totally finished the exam more than 45 minutes before it was due  this makes me a rock <propfemale>, right?"
"if i keep averaging one new piece of information per half hour, i might finish this presentation in a couple weeks  unfortunately, i'm presenting in 42 hours   "

"enjoys yoga, but is slightly creeped out by the name 'corpse pose'   "
my cat is apparently a mix between a puppy and a fainting goat   
"is a little productivity too much to hope for on a warm, <propfemale> friday?"
"i love reading series of journal articles that effectively break down to 'i'm right', 'no, i'm right', and so on  it helps me feel mature "
just got a productivity package from japan! here's hoping asian productivity serves me better than the american type i've been using 
just got a productivity care  package from japan! here's hoping asian productivity serves me better  than the american type i've been using 
is leaving the internet behind for the weekend  should be interesting   
"now that i'm back, i'm in desperate need of productivity  why are there only 24 hours in a day?"
"right after i said more movies need to end with dancing zombies, i watch the episode of the x-files that ends with dancing zombies! that pretty much just made my night "
days which start by playing piano are always better than any other kind of day!

is a doofus 
"had her status hijacked, but is glad at least some people out there didn't agree with the previous one   wink "

is down to three projects  this term needs to be over yesterday   
one more project and then year 1 is done!
"after 25 hours of work, minus 2 hours for sleep, the final project of my first year is finally done  printing it out, turning it in, and collapsing in a puddle of exhaustion   "

is reading about a study which tested familiarity with names by comparing common names to made-up klingon names  i'm officially in love with these researchers (and wondering if i can incorporate klingon's in my thesis as well    )!
finished beating down the introduction to the thesis proposal!
"one thesis proposal draft, done and submitted to adviser  one grad student, tired and missing her bedroom    "
just found a cd-rom with a bunch of stuff from senior year in high school  quite the trip down memory <propfirst>!
"postseason is finally decided and all i'm doing is rooting for any one of seven teams to beat the yankees  this year was not good for any of my \home\"" teams   """
"really does not have the time to deal with teen spirit this weekend    could we add another day to this weekend after homecoming is over so the kids can have their fun, but i can have the time i need to work in a quiet apartment?"
