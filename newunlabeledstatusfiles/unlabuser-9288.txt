listen to everyone  ideas come from everywhere 
the best year-round temperature is a warm heart and a cool head 
no one can make you feel inferior without your consent 
your smile will tell you what feels good 
time 
every flower blooms in it's own sweet time 
"because you e playful ect more from yourself, others respect you deeply "
the philosophy of one century is common sense to the next 
now is the time to try something new 
"love truth, but pardon error "
a smile is your personal welcome mat 
"if you would be loved, love and be lovable "
now is the time to try something new 
a smile is your personal welcome mat
