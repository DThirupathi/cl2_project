had an absolutely amazing weekend   but why's it always feel so lonely right afterwards?  oh well   gonna crash headlong into monday at work in a few hours 
"is having a somewhat lousy day, but has some leftover weekend happiness to balance it out   and plans for this weekend too!   smile "
"curry chicken for dinner, a sudden downpour of rain, and a new karaoke show tonight   "
"just feels wrong working on thursday   and what's with all these people at our shelter in the middle of the afternoon?  if every person in this shelter right now adopted one animal, we'd be out of animals!"
"my horoscope says i'll get a life-changing opportunity today, and that my future is bright   hm "
life-changing opportunities today: 0  dramatic news received today: 0  giant bullfrogs saved from the middle of fairfax pike: 1 
is getting psyched about going to the beach in the morning!   smile 
is on her way to the beach   yay beach!
"is back from the beach   kinda wish i hadn't come back, now "
had a dream last night about being 4 inches tall and nearly being squished by everyone i love   maybe that's why i feel so puny today    annoyed 
curry for lunch!  and <propfemale> bought it for me!  ?
going to my first leesburg karaoke show tonight   kind of excited to go somewhere new   but so not looking forward to work tomorrow morning   ^^;
is crashing hard today   doesn't help that the shelter is somewhat of a madhouse this morning either   
feeling very blah   nothing to do tonight   need to escape and maybe find a happy somewhere    sad 
into the storm i go   
kinda fun day    smile   watching a shot in the dark   probably gonna fall asleep doing so   oyasumi nasai   ?
"holy crap, caribbean curry for dinner! today is a day for une playful ected happy   smile "
whoo!  nothin' like waking up 9 minutes before you have to leave for work 
bleah   chores    sad   but for happy reasons   and i'm wearing <propfemale> ears while i do them so at least it's cute 
"evening of happiness planned!  then in the morning, otakon!  ?"
"having a great time at otakon despite not being able to sing, apparently    annoyed   one more day   "
"had an amazing last day of otakon and even got to spend time with <propfirst> at the inner harbor   kinda magical day    smile   now off to sleep, finally "
"ah, nothing like a soul-destroying bad day at work to follow up one of the best days of your life   ><  i just need to stop coming back from trips "
no more yapping   please     ><
went a little crazy writing   apparently the creative needed to come out in order for the sad to go away   feeling lots better   ?
had a pretty good day despite the nasty headache from the incessant yapping   tomorrow mom says she wants to go out and do a thing   let's see if it actually happens 
"mom backed out on our plans, as usual   don't know why i got my hopes up "
isn't today just a cornucopia of suck 
"yay, tonight is much better than today was    ;"
and i won't forget the way you helped me up when i was down~?
anybody got $4000 they can lend me?  i wanna go to japan 
absolutely wonderful evening   just enough of all the right happy things   ?
is in bad need of something fun to do today   
"drove to west <propfemale>, bought flowers, peaches, and old horror movies, held a parrot, and got rained on   pretty okay day so far "
got elbowed in the chest by an oversized papillon   ouch    sad 
"went shoe shopping with mom, and had bikers beg me not to go when i left leesburg karaoke   haha!  ^^;  awesome evening   feels like the week's turned around "
happy birthday daisuke ishiwatari!
why can't you haunt my real life as often as you haunt my dreams   ?
change of plans    smile 
texas <propmale> and broomfoot 4evar!
"had curry, watched awful, awful movie   now time for g gundam until i fall asleep "
awake too early for work   worried about what's gonna happen   wish me luck 
at least now i don't have that pesky job to get in my way 
feeling amazingly happy after one of the worst days of my life is worth way more to me than any stupid job   thank you 
utterly exhausted   ran around everywhere today to no avail   hopefully a shower and karaoke will make things better 
"awesome night, wonderful company   this is the most happy and least lonely i've felt in i don't know how long   ?"
dear self: don't offer to break in mom's combat boots ever again  bad idea 
is growing sick of personality tests for job applications   sheesh   ><
"worn out from cleaning (yes, with cat ears on)   karaoke tonight and then awesome happy weekend time! ?"
"had a great time at the rockingham county fair with <propfirst> yesterday!  i got to pet a giraffe!  today, flea markets and who knows what else      smile "
"has a previously une playful ected <propfirst> for another night   hooray!  tomorrow, thrift store hopping and the pool   finally!   smile "
i think i signed myself up for the craigslist scam e-mail list   my inbox is full of things that look like replies to job postings but are actually not 
is feeling kinda useless   but isn't giving up 
"gotta go in soon and get my last paycheck, so today might be a little sad   but i got a surprise visit from <propfirst>, so that makes it better    smile "
totally unproductive day   but awesome for so many reasons   ?
"worked my butt off today getting tanks sorted   mÃ¶ is a happy snakey   time for a shower, and then leesburg karaoke!   smile "
"this hand of mine glows with an awesome power!  its burning grip tells me to defeat you!  take this, my love, my anger, and all of my sorrow!"
i have work as an artist! and maybe a gig as a backup vocalist? today is awesome!  smile 
"dear frustrating, worried thoughts in the back of my head: kindly stfu so i can be productive   thanks "
"oh wow, my facebook was broken for like three hours!  i nearly died   x_x  karaoke in a bit, yay!   smile "
had a few vocal gremlins but karaoke was still wonderful   and i got the added bonus of creating what is possibly the finest artistic masterpiece i will ever create    smile 
omg omg i have an interview!!!!!
"all twisted up inside   turn off, nerves   turn on sleep "
"alright   it's go time   i'm going to kick today's ass   getting things done at home, interview's at 1 smile 0, and after that, there will be creativity "
so much for that   they ended up giving the job to someone else in their office   the search continues i guess    sad 
"the creativity, it fills me with happy!   smile   so many new things to think about   no time for worries or regrets "
it's days like today that make me want to drop everything and just go e playful loring   
today was a good day for e playful loring!  took awesome pictures   karaoke tonight!  ?
"rush, why are you harder to sing than iron maiden? sheesh "
"totally wiped out!  karaoke was awesome, except for the crazy people who screamed at me in the bathroom   pretty happy regardless though    smile "
"did some chores, now i feel sleepy   can't doze off   must summon energy for karaoke   "
"tomorrow will be better   no drama, no stress, and my creativity will resurface   and i have something to look forward to    smile "
thanks a lot subconscious   i didn't really need to sleep   
busy day ahead   probably should've slept in a bit less   oh well   off to <propfemale> i go   
"tonight, challenging songs and a runaway brain "
my horoscope was super-correct today 
i don't want to have to leave another cult because i misunderstood the waffle house menu    sad 
"finally home   gonna collapse in a pile now, k?"
feeling less twisted-up inside is awesome    smile 
off to manassas today for books and japanese food and happy    smile 
"happy acquired   shower, food, then karaoke    smile "
dear paving crew currently screwing up traffic in my town: stop it  i have places i want to go 
nobody at karaoke but me   
"oh yay, i have a broken jeep now  what's next?"
can't stand this wait   still don't know what's up with my jeepy   and really want to get out of the house   
fabulous   my jeep threw a <propmale>   they said i need a new motor 
i have the best mom ever   everything's gonna be okay   i've gotta find some way to thank her for this one   
"a good dinner, a long bath, and people who care about me   nothing else matters for now "
is mobile once again   smile 
"today, homework   oh, is there something else going on?   smile "
home   exceedingly happy   can't wait till next saturday   sleep time now 
"oh, awesome  the rental car died too  just keep me away from things with wheels i guess   sad "
yeah  um  whoops  i might be an idiot 
"today, roaming "
has an interview wednesday! woohoo!
rawr   roller coaster day   off to blue fox for karaoke 
"feeling amazing   look out job interview, i'm about to kick your ass "
"well, that was less than ideal   we'll see what happens    annoyed "
"yay, tomorrow morning my jeepy returns!  with a new motor   and a new radiator too apparently    surprise "
"has  a  job   still not sure what, though!"
gah   why do story ideas always have to hit when i'm half-asleep?
"has a jeep, but not enough sleep   gonna be a long, hopefully interesting, day "
so much stuff happening at once   exciting but exhausting too   thankfully nothing on my plate tomorrow but karaoke   and sleeping in!
bad horror movie dreams   slept too late   let's see if i can accomplish something today 
"i'm off to woodstock to inquire about a job   gonna take the top off the jeep and work on my tan a bit on the way there, i think!   smile "
"shaking off a less-than-stellar morning   cleaning the house up before the guys get here, then at-home party, then karaoke party at <propmale>'s!  and my horoscope said to stay home and keep to myself today   "
hi facebook i'm drunk!  smile  and happy for once!
best  birthday  ever   smile 
"had a wonderful time with her karaoke people last night   didn't get so drunk i saw constellations or anything, but definitely enjoyed myself   i wish today were off to a happier start, but it might get better   sushi for lunch, after all   thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes so far    smile "
"delicious mexican food for lunch, yay! they even played the mexican hat dance   smile "
"would really like to enjoy herself at karaoke this evening   so emo-della, stay the fuck home "
"is ridiculously thankful that she has people who care about her  it's been a really long, really good day   i'm going the hell to bed now    smile "
"gaaaaah   no karaoke   ended up painting shelves and talking to mom   she says she's coming out with me friday night, but we'll see if she remembers "
can't find meat-print fabric on the internets   i wonder if it exists?
"ah, the sweet release of karaoke  i think the pent-up energy i had was reaching critical mass "
so frustrated   can't sleep   broke my voice at karaoke and still feel like screaming 
trapped at home on a nasty rainy day    motivation = 0 
lesson learned: don't believe a word drunk mom says    sad 
feeling worn out and old   bedtime   new month starts now   hopefully with new reasons to be happy 
"wow, beautiful day outside!   smile   i think today is a day for adventure   "
has work in the morning   smile 
"oh god, picture twice in the same night is just not fair  not even the man who sounds and looks like booboo bear made human can make up for this "
it's cold this morning and i'm missing my voice   doesn't feel like i'm sick though   working 10-2 today 
first day and i'm already staying late to cover someone else's shift   also i like how they tossed me back into things with no training  good thing i remember!
home   exhausted   gonna collapse now   *flump*
i can honestly say this is the most tired i've been in a really long time   i am gonna sleep in so late   
"yay, <propfemale> <propfemale> buffet for dinner and i didn't get sick from eating it    smile "
and the seasonal sinus infection strikes again    sad 
"is feeling better, but bored   at least there's karaoke tonight to look forward to "
"had a blast at karaoke as usual    smile   set my four alarms, got work in the am   yippee "
awaaake   bleh   work 9-4 smile 0 today 
hates her job already   geez 
"today: fail, fail, and more fail "
sinus infection is almost gone this morning   and i haven't really done much of anything to fight it   awesome 
work 12 - 7 smile 0 today   still hurting from yesterday   we'll see how this goes 
woohoo!  off work early!  and today didn't totally suck!   smile 
"has today off, and it's beautiful outside   but so many things to do!  i'll just have to make an adventure out of getting stuff done    smile "
"has a land line, with a different number than the old one   and a new cell phone, with the same number as the old one    smile "
i will learn to survive 
working 4 smile 0-9 smile 0 today   might hit up leesburg karaoke afterward if i'm feelin' squirrelly    smile 
weird: having a dream about karaoke and remembering the songs people sang  weirder: going to karaoke that day and hearing the same songs 
home   glad i went out   very excited for a three-day weekend   but it is so bedtime    smile 
sang on my own at karaoke and did it surprisingly well  had some great <propfemale> too  i feel like i destroyed a mental block   smile 
totally laid-back weekend was just what i needed to recharge my batteries   ready for adventure tomorrow!   smile 
"yay, it's an absolutely perfect day outside!   smile   off to skyline drive this afternoon!"
"had the best day; that's right, i don't care what you did today, my day was the best   smile  rocking out at karaoke, then home to collapse   "
"broken into pieces and stuck back together again   over and over   i think the pieces are going together right this time, though   at least i hope so "
doesn't wanna go to work    sad   10 smile 0-5 smile 0 today   unless they decide to send me home early yet again 
is covered in glitter  yay xmas ornaments  ><
nothing like a two-hour impromptu nap to make you feel like you've completely wasted your evening   
work 9 smile 0-4 smile 0 today   bleah   sad 
rrrgh  i can see karaoke's going to be a rage release tonight   
you know it's bad when your cats complain because you came home too late   awesome evening at karaoke  ?
going to go buy work pants   guess that means i'm not planning on rage-quitting any time soon 
"feels like she's leveled up, and all the right stats got a huge boost    smile "
"nothing quite like a hundred strangers thinking you're awesome  yeah, the drive was worth it   smile "
"wrote my thoughts down, made sense out of them, and now it's off to work   2-7 today   and afterward, who knows what?   smile "
"was completely wiped after work, but feeling muchly recharged by karaoke   now if the game was going better   "
"alright, who slowed down time today?"
how many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?
well  tonight's given me ample reason to smile   smile 
   and now tonight's given me reason to be angry   i don't want to go to bed this way but i'm too exhausted already to get it all out    sad 
"so yeah   i woke up to a phone call for an interview in two and a half hours, to a place i sent a resumÃ© to yesterday   awesome "
that went really well! i'll know by thursday     smile 
?????!
karaoke time~ ?
"c'mon, today, don't let me down   i need a good reason to be happy "
still haven't heard anything and they close in 15 minutes   that can't be a good sign    sad 
sigh   off to work   though apparently they haven't decided yet   so there's still a <propmale> 
ah  box full of paintbrushes! it's just like old times   
"home from work   plans were canceled   tomorrow, i can has the day off    smile "
"still doesn't know if she has a new job or not   and won't be able to ask till tuesday   off to leesburg karaoke, to enjoy the only work-interference-free bit of weekend i have "
i didn't want to wake up this early but i guess i don't have much say in the matter   at least the sky is pretty this morning 
"senses today will be a battle   but not one she intends to lose   working 1 smile 0-close, then karaoke at <propmale>'s    smile   long day is loooooooooong "
"off i crawl to work   ><  10-5 today, or 10-whenever i collapse from exhaustion "
feeling much more lively now that i'm not covered in glitter and stock room grunge   and i'm at karaoke so i'm in my happy place   smile 
just saw a really bright shooting <propfemale> while driving home and had a hard time deciding what to wish for   only two things i really want right now   maybe i can get both    smile 
can has new glasses next week  no can has new job   sad 
"rip, <propfirst> the octopus    sad "
can't quite shake this feeling   but i'm not going to let it win this time 
work 1-close today   b-dubs after   tonight needs to be phenomenal 
rawr! i is kitteh  why i no can has a grammar?
"yay, awesome night even though work was poo as usual    smile   oh well!  time for a sleep "
"just got to run a kids' crafting demo   we made feathered masks  i thought i would hate it but i actually had fun   found something awesome about my job today, hooray!"
extremely productive day   very happy that work is starting to suck less   got a good day planned tomorrow   now for sleep   
i'm going slightly mad   
running three kids' events today  awesome   smile 
"getting ready for an epic evening    smile   also, i get to dress up for work tomorrow   i really wasn't e playful ecting that   no idea what i'm gonna do just yet   "
rah rah ah ah ah!
sigh   beaten by a tranny  isn't that how it always goes?
"worn the hell out, mentally, physically, and emotionally   what a state to go to work in   "
having second thoughts about my costume   my hair is much too big    annoyed 
is all hippied out   groovy man    smile 
so many things to do and no motivation or focus   even when i start something i can't finish it     why is everything so daunting today?
staying up till 5 is not the most conducive for productivity the next day   i appear to be afflicted with the lazy today   
off to get my new glasses!  yay!   smile 
"wow, the doc wasn't kidding when she said my new prescription would make things look really weird   also i think they make me look a little nerdier    annoyed "
i'll play too    let's see how forthcoming my facebook friends are  leave a one word comment that you think best describes me using the third letter of your 1st name    no repeats! it can only be one word   then copy & paste this on your wall so i can leave one 
"at work till 3 smile 0 (halfway through already, yay) then home to get some actual work done  karaoke tonight!"
"yeah, today is amazing   smile  i won the awesome award for today after all "
bravery is apparently easier to learn than <propfemale>   
"work till close, then rocking out at leesburg   whee!"
"think i pulled a muscle lifting big heavy plastic cases today   oh well, still enjoying karaoke as best i can   smile "
i just hit the high note in heartbreaker  i couldn't do that before   
"yay, sleep and a shower seem to have fixed my back   working 12-8 today, then <propfemale>'s pajama party after!   smile "
"don't be fooled by the brave and cheerful exterior i put up  some old wounds are easily ripped open, especially ones i caused myself "
"had an e playful erience last night   not looking to repeat it ever, ever again   but i thought i'd feel much worse this morning than i do "
"gotta go to work now   till close   augh   i still feel really damn weird   this'll be interesting, that's for sure "
still feeling weird  i really thought i'd have shaken this by now   but i'm in this fog of stupid and i can't figure out how to be smart again   sad 
everything's twisted up again   i thought i had things untangled a while ago but everything just knotted back together 
having lunch with <propmale>! yay!  smile 
worst wake up ever   kidney stone   fuck my life 
"woke up late, with no voice, and my kidney's still issuing complaints   off to work!  10 smile 0-2 smile 0 today, so at least it's not a long shift "
"dear customers, i am not sick, i only strained my voice  please stop acting like i have the plague "
y
i'd listen to my brain a lot more if my heart didn't drown it out 
four and a half hours till work   i need to be productive today   
i must really look like i know where stuff is today   
"sigh   so unnatural being home on friday night   i'm tired, though, and my voice needs the rest, so i'll probably fall asleep soon   meh   tomorrow shall be epic    smile "
"morning, bookface   working 11 smile 0-6 smile 0 today and then <propmale>'s tonight for karaoke and happy!   smile "
pockets are a good place for a unicycle 
"was having a pretty terrible day till i went out to karaoke   problem solved    smile   off tomorrow, looking to get into some kind of mischief   "
"aaah, i just missed a phone call for an interview with some dude who said he got my resumÃ© in the mail   except i've never heard of him and i remember pretty much all the ones i actually mailed off    annoyed   and he didn't answer his phone when i called him back "
"yay, dude called me back! i has an interview wednesday afternoon!"
had an *awesome* conversation with mom   heading to blue fox in a bit   a lil' early so i can actually catch the whole game for once!   smile 
cleaning   getting a new mattress soon!  <propfemale> ears: on!   smile 
new mattress on thursday!  woohoo!  now who wants to help me test it out?   smile 
just got a glimpse of my work schedule next week   i'm going to end up in jail    sad 
"interview time  my nerves just went \aaaaah\"" """
interview was   interesting    annoyed   not sure how that one's gonna come out   not bothering to get my hopes up 
home in time for a nap before my new mattress gets here   yay    smile 
hey!  it's 11 smile 0!  time to drag loud heavy things down the sidewalk!  woohoo!!
11-6 today   hoping it's busy so it passes quickly 
"i has a tired   home for a little bit, then off to leesburg for karaoke    smile "
everywhere you look there's a painful reminder   
"10-5 today, then off for 3 days!  also <propmale>'s tonight!   smile "
"drinking coffee and enjoying it   guess i'll need an \adult\"" card now """
why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door with a thousand million questions about hate and death and war?
woohoo! way to go redskins!!
the kaiju monster of doubt is raging through my tokyo 
"shaking off last night's nasty thoughts   i'm gonna be productive today, and tonight's going to be amazing!   smile "
i think i finally get it 
"found a <propfemale> old-school casio keyboard at a thrift store   the demo on it is \wake me up before you go-go\"" """
"today doesn't count   tomorrow's going to be better, too "
watching flash <propmale> and enjoying a midnight snack   the evening turned out okay after all    smile 
any lunatics out there want to come buy craft supplies at 10:45 tonight?  come on out and visit me at work!   laugh 
"home   feel like i've been beaten up, and i seem to have screwed up my ankle again   so not looking forward to tomorrow or friday   but still, i'm thankful i have a job   and amazing friends   and an awesome mom, too    smile "
awesome dinner   glad mom got it together before i had to go to work    smile   feeling happy despite not really being able to spend the whole day with mom like i wanted to   bout to go fight an angry mob at michaels   it'll at least be an exciting way to spend four hours   and i'm getting paid extra for it 
part one of the battle wasn't bad   not as busy as e playful ected but still plenty crazy   part two in t-6 hours   considering a catnap but it probably isn't gonna happen 
"been writing for the past four hours   and my brain just keeps tossing out stuff   may have to rejoin this after work   as for right now, it's go time!!  time to kick some black friday butt at work!"
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i had espresso this morning  love 
what good is sleeping after work when all you do is dream of work?  blargh 
leveling up 
3-whenever 
"wow, got home at around 7 smile 0 and mom's already obliterated   i'm almost worried to leave her like this, but sticking around won't do me any good either    annoyed "
sleepy time   mm-hm 
"is about to run a kids' birthday party at work   never done this before, but it's gonna be fun!"
"today is a good day at work   smile  and i'll be done with it in two hours, yay!"
testing 123 can anybody hear me?
aw  the high note in run to the hills doesn't even phase me anymore  gonna have to find a new adrenaline rush song 
"internet seems to be working again, yay   off work tomorrow   gonna dedicate a portion of the day to learning some new songs for karaoke    smile "
"i don't know where this good mood came from  i don't think it's mine   i think i found it under a rock  whatever, i'm keeping it   smile "
short day at work today   and awesomeness to look forward to tonight   just wish it weren't quite so gloomy out   
i guess this isn't cold november rain anymore   but it's still cold   and still probably hard to hold a candle in 
augh!  why does benadryl always knock me out like this?  it'd be nice if it actually took care of the problem as well   
"dear everyone: i am okay  my sinuses are infected from my allergies and i had to take benadryl, which makes me sleepy  i am not sad or upset  but thank you for worrying about me   love "
"relaxing with a cup of peppermint tea and my lappy    smile   nice quiet evening in, hopefully it'll knock some of this ickyness out of my system "
wish i felt better already   hopefully staying in today and resting will make me feel better by tomorrow    annoyed 
snow!
"working 1-8, then <propmale>'s tonight!  feeling a lot better too   not quite 100% but way better than the last few days    smile "
"i assure you, under this coating of glitter and pine cone debris, my heart still beats, my mind still functions, and my spirit fights on "
woohoo! wide awake at three am is exactly what <propfemale> wanted to be today!
work till 5 smile 0  making stuff out of duct tape & pipe cleaners today   hopefully some happiness will be derived from this 
nothing like standing in front of an open door for seven hours when the wind chill's down to 19 degrees   if i wasn't sick before i probably will be tomorrow!
they say that absence makes the heart grow fungus   
"more days need this kinda turnaround   i started off depressed and pissed off when i left for work, and today's been nothing but awesome   smile "
off to work in a few   be out at blue fox around 10 smile 0 or so   hoping for some excitement   
"oh man, une playful ected happiness after work is the best   karaoke was awesome    smile "
"had a great dinner out and some good company for the evening, so today is a happy day too!   smile   also mom bought my humidifier for me, so maybe i'll be a little less prone to respiratory death this winter   yay "
"had a small adventure today, yay!  working 6-10 smile 0 again (blarg) and then karaoke at bdubs right after    smile "
"12-7 today, <propmale>'s tonight   it's gonna be a long day, but hopefully a good one!"
"yay, no work tomorrow   time for sleep is now till whenever my body decides it's done sleeping "
holy crap it snowed overnight! i knew it felt like snow   
i finally figured out why i feel so off tonight  i didn't eat all day  i feel really stupid now that i figured it out   
"food in stomach: check   happy from karaoke: check  ridiculously comfy, warm bed: check   good night    love "
"feels like i'm just spinning my wheels   i'm trying real hard to get out of here, but i can't gain any traction "
mom decorated for christmas without me 
i was just in a dark room with two dudes   
found my phoenix down    smile 
"beat   don't wanna think about working that shift again tomorrow   gonna wrap myself up in my blankets till i'm a human coccoon and sleep till i wake up   goodnight, world "
"go away, it's too cold to come out of here and i'm still not a butterfly yet "
"4-11 smile 0 again   any loonies wanna come out and buy glitter glue and yarn at 10 smile 0, come on out "
"sore and tired but not sleepy   just give up, consciousness, i need rest "

"quick, someone clone me and then send my clone to work so i don't have to go   also clone my jeep so she has something to drive and i don't have to stay home "

"when i let my head lead my decisions, it's always wrong   but my heart's usually wrong too, at least so far in the short term   so i guess i'm going to have to start listening to my feet   they say they're tired   i think i agree "

"sigh   slept through half the evening, missed one thing i was gonna do, and i'm too poor to go out to karaoke, too   ><"
who would've thought that being asleep for three or four hours in the evening could lead to not being able to sleep at night?  hahahaha ugh   ><
sometimes a happy phone call is all you need to turn your day around    smile 
"happy plans for tomorrow night, but saturday   please hurry up and get here "
on my way to <propfemale> for foreign karaoke  smile

stupid sinuses   at least i have my tissue octopus to cuddle 
at this rate i'm going to be a quivering pile of goo by the end of the week  ><
"work from 6 am till they let me go home today   and work tomorrow too, now   i've got to be out of my freaking mind "
"i just woke up   and i was terribly confused about what day it was   i had a lovely dream, though "
"11-7 today   kinda glad i gave up my day off to go in today, as i would derive little enjoyment from being stuck at home on a rainy crappy day "
   now what?
"not feeling like myself   can't quite pinpoint what's wrong   lack of social interaction, feeling burned out from work, or just feeling fed up with this whole situation   or most likely a combination of everything "
friends and bacon are a wonderful cure for the blues   smile 
it looks like a beautiful day outside   i'm glad i'm off    smile

tiem for a normal sleep    smile 
"thank goodness, only 2 hours left  >< did all of winchester have the day off today or something?"
no more truck days    laugh 
"sorry, future <propfemale>  present <propfemale> wants some kind of happy and karaoke is likely the best she's going to do "
"here's hoping karaoke, ihop, and a shower are a good enough substitute for sleep to get me through my shift that starts in an hour   probably not "
36 hours since i slept last and i'm still more coherent than my mother   ><
"'cause i need freedom now, and i need to know how to live my life as it's meant to be   "
"thank you, google maps, for making this trip awesome "
spending easter with <propfirst>!   smile   and my room seems to have been invaded by peeps 
"first day of official managerdom, here i come  it seems to be off to a good start "
must resist urge to fall asleep after work   something fun to do would be nice this evening   -_-
work in an hour   maybe today will be better 
no  not better 
10 smile 0-close   wheeeeeeeeeeeee 
"it's rare that i can come home from work totally exhausted and still have a smile on my face   it was a hard day, but it seriously paid off in the end    smile "
one incredibly strange dream and one really scary one do not make for a restful night's sleep 
"beautiful day to share with andrew   and lis for a while, too!  hope the rest of the weekend is this nice!   smile "

off to work till 7   time to put away my sadness 
under pressure 
off to work   let's see what today brings 
"rainy tuesday night, could you be more boring?"
"why is it that i can't manage to stay up late on my own when i actually want to accomplish something?  ugh   goodnight, i guess "
"one more day of madness, then i'm off for two days   thank goodness "
mom has a job interview this afternoon  go mom go!
hmm   what to do this evening?  and tomorrow and friday for that matter?   annoyed 
since when did i become the responsible adult in this household?
"why can't i focus on anything but what i've screwed up?  this isn't a useful mindset, but it's one i seem to be completely locked into   it doesn't offer any solutions, just makes me feel terrible   what is the purpose of this?"
not having a good brain day   maybe some karaoke will solve this 
i'm a cold-hearted possum murderer   sad 
the first friday in may is no pants day   
i'm just gonna let something brand-new happen to me   
"goodbye, safety net   hope i don't need you "
i don't belong here   
"i feel like an impostor   an angry, bitchy version of myself   this isn't what i'm like   "
