going to longview on thursday to spend x-mas with my dad  i hope it turns out ok 
hoping things look up for me!
happy new year everyone
my new years resolution is to let go of what i can`t control and let everything that happens to me ultimately make me a stronger and wiser person  post comments and let me know what yours is!
well my internet still works thank god 
"just got back from fast <propmale>'s! me and <propfirst> played like 10,000 games of pool  i had a great time! looking forward to writing my new mixtape! keep hating bitches but remember i'm one of a kind!"
sitin at da mall   prolly going to fedex office afterwards 
"everyone loved \let me find out\""   i wish i could get ppl to appreciate my other music as much """
being without a lab blows!
when they gng to notice me  i go hard on every verse 4real 
"something we all adore, something worth dieing for, nothing but pain, stuck in this game, searching for fortune and fame   "
e playful eriencing set backs trying to record my music  this happens everytime 
in fort worth   trying to get some more equipment to record with!
nuttin' that ppl do surprizes me anymore   strait up 
"god is great, beer is good, and people are crazy"
"i go da' hardest, flow so retarded, i'm discusted wit myself i mean uh where do i start   haha "
i'm checking out this college online that has special programs for audio production  they are supposed to send me information  i hope it's what it's cracked up to be   
i just created a shadowscape ent  myspace   new beats will be uploaded weekly 
i <propfemale> stopped to pay attention to certain things in my past  it sucks when you remember them   i hate to dwell 
i put my trust in god   he's the only one willing to help me 
"i worked out yesterday for like 3 hours  \haha  ima get me a protein shake now "
<propmale> 11:13 - \if you then, though \3d4a551b03dc35b7dfa38c9033cc3cae,just got done doing pull ups and curls  trying to get cut!! haha 
i can't change the mistakes that i've made in the past  all i can do is create a brighter future! i'm far from perfect but i have a good heart and there is someone who deserves to see the dscent side of me  to the rest of you hatas   you never deserved it!
watching the mlb all-star game  everything seems evenly matched right now  no score yet 
i wish i could somehow understand other peoples' inconsistent behaviour for just one day 
it's been 3 years and i still can't believe you found your way back to me! i ain't complaining at all tho! i love you!
everybody i know my age is in good health   not me 
idgaf what anyone thinks about me period! i'm a beast bitch! if i really wanted to i could crush everyone in my way! hahahaha!
i wanna thank all the people that have stuck by me threw the years! if it was for y'all i prolly wouldn't be here   god bless!
god has blessed me more times than i realize   maybe i need to pay more attention 
be careful what you wish for cuz you just might get it and when you get it you might not know what to do with it and it just might come back on you ten fold   
producing some bangin ass beats to go on da' pro-cess mixtape! me and v3numb gonna murder em!
life can break me down but my faith in god is my crutches!

everybody has their own opinions and theories on life   everyone also has their own personality  don't be prejudiced against mine just because yours is different  when you harbor only self righteousness you tend to weaken your image by looking down on others 
i can't stand people   4real 
"you hold me inside your <propfemale> like a terminal stain on life, you condescend to my primal brain and twist me around like a knife, can't begin to e playful lain, the feelings i have restrained, don't ask me how i am, because you're too busy planning your epitaph, let me tell you\don't - try to be the one - person who has stayed - just to say they never left me! aggravated, complicated, someone say it god, i never learn   "
"bout to get ready to go on a date with my baby!! going to pancho's, then to see jackass 3d and paranormal activity 2!! btw: changed my status to single on accident, you assholes!"
