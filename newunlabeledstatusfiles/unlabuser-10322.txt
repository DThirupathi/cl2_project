i guess theres some people that are never gonna be happy!!
"life is too short to wake up in the morning with regret  so, love the people who treat you right, forget about the ones who don't, and  believe everything happens for a reason  if you get a <propmale>, take it, if it changes your life, let it  nobody said it "
advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer and wish we didn't   
never regret something that once made u smile!

"\when men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go and you've just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low go ask <propfemale> i think she'll know\"""""

"its long but funny so read it!! growing up   your best friend turns into your worst enemy, lollipops turn into ciggarettes, the innocent ones turn into sluts, homework goes in the trash, detention becomes suspension, soda becomes vodka, undies turn into g-strings, kisses turn into sex  remember when getting high meant swinging on the playground, when protection meant wearing a helmet,"
"love my sister week: if you have a sister who has made you laugh, wiped your tears, hugged you, watched you succeed, saw you stumble, cheered you on, kept you strong, and prays for your happiness, copy and paste this into your status  i have the best sisters in the world!! <propfemale> <propfemale> dreyer & chanteal <propmale>"
