"i'm not ashamed!!! let's see how many people on facebook aren't ashamed to show their love for god and admit that jesus is their savior    we need to get god back in <propfemale>    if you're not ashamed, copy and paste this in your status"
check out my myspace      i updated and changed a couple things! soon to have more recent pics!
girls girls girls      ! lol! not doing much of anything really!  talking to will like normal! gettin ready to start preppin a bangin ass dinner! mmmmmm! can't wait!
don't feel well at all! this sucks! it seems like everytime i turn around i'm sick again! aaahhh! also wondering what it is about my life that is so freakin interesting to others? people seems to be more worried about what the hell is going on in my life then their own! wtf? the older they are the more they figure they have to talk about! we aren't in grade school now ladies   seriously! grow up and move the hell on!
so much running through this cloudy winded mind of mine!
"omg am i pooped! i need sleep!!!!!!!!!!!! between <propfemale> and <propfemale>, i can't get any sleep! toss and turn then hot and cold! nothing but a pain in the tush! all i want to see is the back of my eyelids!"

juice??? crangrape or cranapple?? the real question    ? i'm voting for the crangrape myself! cranapple only if mixing with alcohol! what do you all think???
hating the fact that i feel like i have no one to depend on but myself these days          sad   leave it to someone else and you're leaving your ass open for penetration!
can't wait to get off work and go home    must get sleep! lol! my ass is beat and i'm not talking kinky stuff either!

my body hurts all over and my face is deff sun burned! it was worth every last little ache and pain! can't wait for next year! bring it on!
had a great day today but it was long as all hell! my head is killing me! watched my neighbors get evicted today and it about broke my heart! my heart and thoughts were on the infant they had when her crib and belongings were being ripped through by a bunch of blood sucking vampires with no shame! my prayers go out to them!
what's on my mind   you really don't want to know at the moment! it would make me sound like a horrible person! only god can judge me    and give his forgiveness!

just made some kick ass homemade chicken and dumplings   omg can't wait to sit down and eat  finally i can keep food down       its freakin great
