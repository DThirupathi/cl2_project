thinks a lot of people out there need to take a class on how to be considerate human beings    the little things go a long way!
i need some new books to read    any suggestions?
"jackpot! just found a single dvd that so far contains: finding nemo, monsters inc, toy story, toy story 2, a bugs life, beauty and the beast, and 4 other unnamed movies as of yet     we've stopped to watch beauty and the beast!"
"happy 3rd birthday, to my precious big boy!"
