well today sucks    
a good long drive down a road that thankfully had no cops and lots of curves does wonders for ones mood! i feel 1000% better!
<propfirst> debose to the house!!!!
"hmm i believe that the florida gators needs to do something different with the qb rotation    like let <propmale> <propmale> throw the ball to keep the defense from stacking the box every time, everyone knows <propfirst> brantley isn't a run threat so make them realize someone else is a pass threat!"
the florida gators need a new offensive coordinator!
"so my car is \limited\"" to 155 however i just hit 167 before i had to slow down for a corner   another 1 4 mile and i'm sure i could have maxed out my 170 speedo!"""
if <propmale> addazio is still the florida offensive coordinator on monday i'm switching my favorite team to tcu!
wow the cowboys are winning!
<propmale> tebow rushed for a td and now just threw his first td pass!

whoever messed up the gc should just kill themselves     i've spent 2hrs trying to burn out whatever crap they got in it and have made no progress!
"guess i should go back to being a cowboys fan, <propmale> phillips is gone and <propfirst> romo isn't starting     "
"the things you year in a hospital waiting room \we could have had a camaro   but we had have a kid instead!!\"""""
"guess i can't say nothing exciting ever happens in kansas city, tonight is ksu vs duke, a possible preview of the national championship? i hope so!"
feel like this is gonna be a long week    
ut finds new ways to amaze me every week    i can't imagine <propmale> will be the qb next year    if he is then i mourn for my friends who are ut fans!!
"as much as it pains me to say, cam <propmale> looks like a heisman trophy winner today!"
well now there is only 1 thing that could keep cam <propmale> from winning the heisman: proof he got paid to go to auburn   
"went to bed when boise st was up 24-7 at halftime, so you can imagine my surprise when i woke up and heard they lost! 'bout damn time!! go tcu football!!!"
game time! florida gators at florida state seminoles!!!
please help the florida gators and support this cause: fire <propmale> addazio
"sometimes i wish i wasn't an only child, this is one of those times!!!"
"tcu football moving to the big east is a bad move!!! the big east is a weak conference, and the mountain west is getting stronger! pit is the perennial power of the big least and they lost to utah who got crushed by tcu  the big east doenst have a single team worthy of a bcs bowl! and with boise and <propfemale> moving to the mountain west it is a much stronger conference than the big east!!"
so i woke up to a pot of fresh starbucks coffee and hot scones in the oven    its times like this when i love living at home!!
this is going to be a long and miserable weekend!!!
never thought i'd say this but boomer sooner!
so everyone knows i'm an sec fan but i hate cam <propmale> and by extension auburn   so it hurts me that i can't in good conscience pull for the sec champion to win
can it be thursday already?
"so i can write a fb status update that is \too long\"" yet i have writers block on my 10 <propfemale> research paper??? this is bull shit!!"""
"its amazing how just hearing the right song can ease your mind, therefore allowing you to get past the writers block that has killed your progress for so long!"
hmm at ~1 <propfemale> per hr i still have ~7 hrs left    i need to pick up the pace   
"considering i got no sleep last night, today has gone quite well  smile "
yeah short nap didn't help    
"been awake for 45 of the last 48 hours     screw school, im never doing this again!!"
we will miss you urban meyer! but moving forward <propfirst> mullen should be the next coach of the florida gators!!
is it weird that in the last 2 months i've grown to despise weekends?
everyone knows that after the <propmale> bush scandal you have to pay your players the same way you would make any other under the table payment: in cash or with gold coins   they will probably never have any real evidence on cam <propmale> till his dad gets greedy dumb and tries to move $200k in krugerrands   
store is sloww    its gonna be a long day     can it just be tomorrow already??
"who would have thought the florida gators would hire will muschamp?? on one hand its like kicking texas while they are down, so i like it! but i really wanted <propfirst> mullen to be the next coach!"
