"my tribute to meggie cont: when you actually meet someone, you may not really meet them for years to come, or maybe you already met them  i am just wondering which of you rubes i am blowing off right now, or perhaps then "
"my tribute to meggie: you know how they say that time flies when your having fun, the opposite must be true as well  well our minds can only occupy one moment in time  so i have a theory that everyone is going along in a different conscious point in their life and is only rarely there with you "

well my sojourn into the world of modern and avant garde <propmale> was pretty much a bust (i must be related to that <propmale> stein guy people keep mentioning)  still the day wasn't a total waste  i saw this really old guy in a coffee shop who couldn't quite see his phone to send a text message so he was using a monocle for a better view  in the famous words of some credit card commercial which i can't remember: priceless 
i wonder if this is how atlas felt when he went to get the <propfemale> apples

"i got a virus messing up my computer  it wasn't letting my virus software search, when it did, it didn't find the virus  so i tried to do a system reset, to an earlier point before the virus popped up  unfortunately, that really messed up my computerand it would freeze on start-up  after trying several fixes i found one for the virus  but thesystem restore, while i believe it removed the virus, was now the problem   "
