trying to forget someone you love is like trying to remember someone you never knew 
hello all  i hope everyone had a great day  and may your night be even better 
guess not   lol

"okay,so       say you had this friend and she was preganant and you were hearing from a few people that your ole man could be daddy of your friends unborn baby  you brush it off at first,but then everytime you go around her,she acts funny and doesn't really speak to you and she totally avoids your ole man when you are around  what would you think? would you think maybe the rumor was true or what?"
i hope everyone's night was great  i'm going to try to occupy myself while i wait for him to get home            he's late again   sad 
"i've noticed when you're left to alone so much,lonliness seems to become your best friend   sad "
listening to my music i just put on profile  got to find something to do 
is wandering what time he'll be home tonight 
couldn't sleep      haven't been to bed yet           i can not believe i'm still awake 
success is not final  failure is not fatal  it is the strength to continue that counts 
"maybe i will get away for the night and get so damn drunk that i for get about everyone who doesn't give a shit like they tell me they do            and who knows,maybe i won't give a shit!!!!!!!!"
"if your week has been messed up and the bullshit of everyday life has got you down   i say you just need to go out tonight,get your drink on,and say :fuck it     tonight it's all about me \"",2010-05-28 23:10:23""",13c6afd4ba32 laugh 7052eed1c7e2373d21,"you know,i was watching something on television earlier and it made me wander how these people could who have children could abuse them in any way  as a parent you are suppose to love and protect your children,not be the 1 who hurts them  i just don't understand how anyone could do that to thier babies  it makes me sick "
busy day today and i have this killer headache  i hope all have a wonderful day today  xoxo
"if tears could build a stairway and memories build a lane,i'd walk right up to heaven,and bring you home again \mommy loves you so much,emilie!!!!!!!! i miss you!!!!!!!!"
"i've come to realize that if you are afraid of love,your heart will break any way     only in not half so nice a fashion as when you let somebody love you "
"do you ever get to the point where it's like you help and help people so much and even though you sincerely do love to help people as much as you possibly can,sometimes you just get fed up with giving and giving and giving and getting nothing back when you need the help? just a thought "
"you know,you can place judgement on other people all day long,but when it comes down to it,at the end of the day they are still who they are and you are just another person talking shit "
"question ladies,if some girl sent your ole man a friend request on here and he acts like it pisses him off that she did because he said he don't even really talk to her and he's not intrested in being friends with her,would you ask her why she sent it and tell her to oleave him alone? what would you do?"
"i come to realize that people are going to continue to talk shit and friends are gonna come and go,so the best thing to do is ignore the shit talking from pathetic people with nothing better to do and enjoy each friendship to the fullest while they last "
"it's funny how people will make up things,even if it still gets them bitched at,just to keep from telling the truth and keep hiding things from you "
"you know,even a person isn't <propmale> and didn't complete school    they can still be good parents that love thier children and still provide what thier children need "
love is a spirit of all compact of fire
you don't stop laughing because you grow old  you grow old because you stop laughing 
i just want to say thank you to everyone who is trying to help me  i greatly appreciate it so much 
"well,i think i'll get off here now  good night to all and may you all have sweet dreams "
"i just want to tell all the parents who,while you may not have alot of money and a huge house,but you do make sure your children have what they need and you give them your unconditional love     good job!!!!!!!! you are great parents  and,always remember,there is no such thing as perfect parents  mistakes are made,but that is what helps you and your children learn and grow "
"so,here i sit    hope crashed to the ground again  time lost  clock stops ticking  tears flow down my face as the pieces of my broken heart break even more  can't do this anymore  all hope is lost  my life and happiness never to return  this is the end for me "
"you tell me it's hopeless  you tell me to give up  you tell me it's final \i tell you i still have hope  nothing is final  i will not give up \mommy loves you,gabryl,clara,allison,joseph,peter,daniel,and <propfemale>  mommy will never give up!!!!!!!!"
"attention\every one : please spend one <propfemale>  and read this     urgent from glend \eagles hospital 7 women have died after inhaling a free perfume sample \that was mailed to them  this product was poisonous! if you recieve free\samples in the mail such as, lotions, perfumes, diapers, etc  throw \   them away  this is not a joke     send to all friends and family see more"
just watched true blood   smile  let's hope sookie is a good shot 
"waste not your time in anger of things now taken away,but love and <propfemale> the beautiful memories that are eternally with you to stay "
love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence 
"i'm a lover,not a fighter       but,i will fight for what i love "
"it's hard to wait around for something you know might not happen,but it's even harder to give up,when you know it's everything you ever wanted "
my heart goes out to <propmale> rosier's family  you are all in my prayers 
"getting off here for now so i can get ready to go out with two of the most important men in my life,my daddy and my hubbie   smile  yay!!!!!!!! \talk to all later  hugs n kisses  everyone have a safe and fun night  xoxo"
i have come to realize that some people just aren't meant to be happy no matter what they do 
"lifes a bitch cause if it were a slut,it would be too easy "
"don't let it bother you when one person ignores you  there are plenty of other people who enjoy your conversation,your time,     you "
i used to think being the oldest of 6 sucked because i had the responsability of being the one who had to set the right example for the other 5  i was wrong  i now realize what sucks about being the oldest is having to except when they one by one get older and don't have time for thier big sis anymore   sad  i miss the good ole days when we all <propmale> out   sad 
"just a message to a person who wants to talk shit about who i am with,shut the f*ck up  you don't know shit about me,my sisters,or who we are with  you couldn't know anything about any of us cause you haven't been in our lives to know anything  and,please,take note of this,your opinion don't make me or break me  you are just another asshole with an asshole opinion  oh,and one more thing,please have a nice day  mwa  smile "
i hope everyone has a beautiful day  i haven't been getting much sleep lately so i am going to go lay down and catch me a little cat nap  i will talk to you all later  love and hugs  xoxo

"it's funny how guys always think that us females are so damn stupid  kinda makes you sit back and laugh in a way,after you get being pissed  lol if only they knew us chics are smarter than they think "

"i remember a time when we were all younger and rumors didn't matter  we all were friends with people no matter what anyone said  then,as time went on and we all grew up,everything changed  we started letting words control our lives and friendships  makes you wander if getting older really makes you wiser  maybe being young and ignorant was when we all at our wisest "

my life sucks  sitting here at my momma's house waiting a little bit longer to see if they're coming home  if not it's walking back home and i guess i'll try to see the family tomorrow 
"thank you,dear lord,for the angels you sent from up above to my children  my babies needed them and you sent them  thank you!"

"so,far thanksgiving is okay  except for the fact that my brother,jeremy,still won't speak to me just because of things he's heard  it bothers me more than i let it show and be known  i've always been so close to him  it sucks when all you want to do is cry on a holiday that should be happy "
is sitting here with a smile 
"it never stops amazing me how they will lie straight to your face because they think you are stupid,when in all actuallity they are the ones who are stupid for under estimating you "

"any guy can love a thousand girls,        but only a rare guy can love just one girl in a thousand ways "
a man sees himself through the eyes of the woman he loves 
"in every girls life there will always be those three guys   the one she loves, the one she hates, and the one she can't live without   and in the end   they're all the same guy "
all truths are easy to understand once they are discovered;the point is to discover them 
what time is <propmale> hewitt open til at wal*mart today? does anyone know?
getting offline now  too frickin'aggrevated 
sometimes it is better to smile in front of everyone than to cry all alone 
\you can close your eyes to things you don't\,13c6afd4ba32 laugh 7052eed1c7e2373d21,i think that the only reason people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that dont change; when everybody and everyting else does 
somebody please tell me what time <propmale> hewitt at wal*mart of starke closes today  please!!!!!!!!

"you know,it sucks when you're a smoker and don't have any cigs  couldn't file my taxes today,no check,and no money  can we say,\aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh\""?"""
"you've got to take the good with the bad, smile with the sad, love what you've got, and remember what you had  always forgive, but never forget  learn from mistakes, but never regret "
be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind 
"always put yourself in the other's shoes  if you feel that it\hurts you, it probably hurts the person too "
never allow someone to be your priority while you're just their option
being sad with the right people is better than being happy with the wrong ones 
"in the words of my oldest daughter        \my eyes is crazy!\"" lol\",13c6afd4ba32 laugh 7052eed1c7e2373d21,nothing ever goes as planned 
"sometimes you just canâ€™t open up to someone \not because you donâ€™t trust them \but because once you tell someone how you feel inside, youâ€™re giving them permission to hurt you"
the true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good 
"*attention* <propfirst> is in need of platelets for transfusion, if you are a negative blood type and can donate, would you please come to shands at gainesville (main hospital) and donate? copy and repost on your walls as well please   thanks so much !!"
it's not right to treat other people like crap just because one person treated you like crap   sad

"remember,what people say about you behind your back doesn't even matter  their words will not make or break you   smile "
"why are you so stupid today? anyway,i think it's very typical of you  lmao"
it is strange how often a heart must be broken before the years can make it wise 
"we all lose friends   we lose them in death, to distance and over time  but even though they may be lost, hope is not  the key is to keep them in your heart, and when the time is right, you can pick up the friendship right where you left off  even the lost find their way home when you leave the light on"
"friendship isn't about whom you have known the longest    it's about who came, and never left your side "
"â€œtruly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget â€�"
never e playful lain yourself  your friends don't need it and your enemies won't believe it â€�
"these days flattery wins friends, truth begets hatred "
a friendship that can cease has never been real 
"if you have a best friend who's made you laugh    stuck up for you   drove you crazy    got mad at you    watched you succeed    saw you fall    picked you back up    cheered you on    had your back, ready to fight the person who made you mad    & all of these things made your friendship stronger & you can't do without their friendship paste this to your status and see if they know who they are "

"here's a question for you facebook friends  if you tell a person that someone else has pill addiction and they need help to quit,is it right for the person you told to turn around and give pills to the one with the pill addiction?"
"i am a nice person and don't like being mean,but right about now,yeah,i am going to be mean  a certain somebody needs to stop thinking everything i post is about him  and,if he has something to say about anything i post,then say it to me  i love my sister and am really tired of him upsetting her  now,here ya go  this is about him "

"when impressing your friend becomes so important that you don't care about if it hurts the woman you (supposedly) love,then maybe it's time for you to think and decide if you even really want to be her anymore and just stop making her cry "
"i'm not a perfect girl  my hair doesn't always stay in place  i spill things alot  i can pretty clumsy at times  i have a broken heart  my friends and i sometimes fight  and,maybe some days nothing goes right  but,when i think about it and take a step back,i remember how amazing life truly is and that maybe,just maybe,i like being unperfect "
