"'loneliness, insomnia, and change:  the fear of these is even worse than the reality '  ~mignon mclaughlin, the second neurotic's notebook, 1966 t t"
"i'm finally on meds, things are better; i just don't know why i feel depressed "
"\the world needs anger  the world often continues to allow evil because it isn't angry enough \""~bede <propmale> \",f7a5e2a9df63e06e370f laugh 8e3488cfa3,"why does the wind blow at such funny angles,\where may emotions sway with such a breeze\where my heart can ache at the pain of another\do i feel to much, or just too deeply\for those who are great\for those who glow with such bright light\i wish to speak love, but that word so mis-taken\so misunderstood\i say it freely now\i love you, i love you great and i love you deeply\i simply just\love you"
"part 1\lonely, am i, between every beat of my heart\silence that comes and goes\reminds me of silence from you\light remains, glowing, flickering\casting shadows upon our memories\shining upon tomorrows dawn\the hearts rhythem doesnt change"
"part 2\lonely, am i, between my breaths\still, unmoving, as love is\the sea swells, ice runs across my feet\it travels up my spine, like the warmth from you once did\this sea is boiling compared to your touch\as i sit and ponder\lonely, for so long though\the sun is rising\perhaps love is too"
"my body(part 2)\my nails, long and smooth\leaving ghost trails down your back\you shiver and sway\like the natural rhythm of my hips\lastly, as i walk away, you notice what moves me\long and slender, like porcelain my legs\as you finally take me all in,\iâ€™m to far away\you never spoke, just watched\my body"
"my body(part 1)\i walk, i see you watch me\your eyes devour\my hair, red like the fire of my soul\my eyes, deep blue and warm\windows to my heart\wish to swim?\you follow my breath\your eyes, rise and fall"
"i can feel my blood flow\between your fingers,\as you hold my heart to yours\you breath and steal mine\intertwined and falling\speak, so words may pass my lips\cry and i can feel your joy\love then i may feel\your blood between my fingers"
i am so full of poetry!! ^ ^
"the winds have chnged again\leaves fall and your scent passes\tails twitch, growling quietly\old friends, new paths\daylight fades\until another day"
"waiting for the breeze to come\to smell your scent once more\yonder fields where old hearts roam\and memories from yore\sighing to encourage wind\<propfemale> coming to an end"
"caught between the winds again\the branches sway\the fields shiver\in between the two\i look for a river"
"tired, -hangs head- wow "
"timid little creature\standing in a clearing\if only one could reach her\to show a world with out fearing\i wish to take her by the hand\show her lovely things across the land\if only i could touch her\if she'd let some one love her\such a lovely timid creature\if only one could meet her"
"excerpt from journal annoyed i will get back to the sexual, sensual <propfemale> i once was  i will walk down the street and be that draw dropping beauty that nearly stops traffic  i will become the woman that into a room and even the woman will stare  i will be that innocent, free spirit that has a dark side  i will be the wet dream you wish you had "
"journal entry part two annoyed i will become that woman again i am a woman of power, of class, a woman \that knows who she is and who you want to be, i will be that woman \again  i may have been torn down,"
"part three annoyed  but the best thing about rebuilding is\ you can rebuild better the second time  and if i am torn down again it \will be by my hand, not the hands of others in california i said i \wouldn't hid my voice anymore, so get ready because i am ready to speak \ i love me!"
everyone loves a good bit of confusion   
"winged\open your wings\feel the wind, full force\fly with your feet on the ground\looking down, while moving up\feel your feathers\show them proud\power in beauty\beauty in self\beat you wings\cause the wind of change\control the chaos\the chaos within\show yourself full force\open our wings"

"love isnt a two way street, and thats alright\i'll still talk with you all night\i'll still give you a safe place\when the world wont give you space\i'll give you a shoulder to cry your eyes out\i'll give time to show what your heart is about\i'll give you trust and never ask for what you can't give\i'll show you reasons to live\i cant be with you, but i'll give you everything, \because your amazing"
