why do the tv stations treat people like they have a 5 year-old mentality?
question: what gives any one person the right to force their will on another without the other's consent? is this not called coercion?
"some examples:  if i were to demand money out of someone under threat of force, that would be considered armed robbery  if an institution demands money out of someone under threat of force, that is considered paying their fair share "
"if i were to kill someone because i regarded them as a threat to my life or way of doing things, that is considered murder  if an institution kills someone because they consider them to be a threat to their existence or challenges their way of doing things, it is considered patriotic and honorable "
"if a man straps a bomb to himself and blows up innocent people, he is considered a terrorist  if a man fighting for an institution uses a fighter plane to drop a bomb on an apartment complex of innocents, he is considered courageous "
"if a man calls his creator by a different name than the institution, he is considered to be a heretic and therefore must be persecuted and tortured  if a man persecutes and tortures heretics in the name of the institution, he is considered a saint and is to be honored above others "
why is this?
happy <propfirst>'s day everyone!
