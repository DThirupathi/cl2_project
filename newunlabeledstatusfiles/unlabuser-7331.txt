"**my favorite quotes for today**\*â€œa smart person knows all the rules so he can break them wisely â€�\*â€œreality is a hallucination brought on by lack of alcohol â€�\*â€œe playful erience is what you get when you donâ€™t get what you want â€�\*â€œif at first you donâ€™t succeed, try, try again  then give up  thereâ€™s no use in being a damn fool about it â€�"

give me back my point of view cuz i just can't think for you  all that's left has gone away & there's nothing there for you to prove  look what you've done  you made a fool of everyone  
"when we're high, when we're low, boy i promise i will never let you go  said i got your back boy  keep my swagger, keep it looking good for ya, keep it looking hood for ya  cuz shorty if you don't know  "
if everyone was perfect then this world would be a very boring place  
what do say in a moment like this  when you can't find the words to tell it like it is  just bite your tongue & let your heart lead the way  sometimes you gotta listen to the silence & give yourself a little time to breath  what do you say  
when you have a fat friend  there are no seesaws  only catapults 
"\i never think of the future - it comes soon enough \"" <propfirst> einstein"""
