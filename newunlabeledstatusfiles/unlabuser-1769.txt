"starting to realize our baby boy will be here soon  angel has been having contractions every 2 hours and 25 mins apart  wait, getting anxious is more like it   "
contractions with angel slowed down in intensity after she took a hot bath last night  no baby jayden yet  we continue to wait    
contactions have come down to 10 mins apart  this looks like it will be the real deal!!!! is it about time to call the doctor?
"walking around making laps around the store  no baby yet, but hoping the walking will speed things up"
angel is at the hospital getting checked out  stay tuned     more to come
"here's the update so far on the possible birth of baby jayden: angel is dilated to a 3 and cervix is 60% thinned  they are trying to stop the contractions, but it looks like it's not working  any takers on a possible birth very soon?"
"angel is being sent home, but if the contractions get strong again, we are coming back   and we wait again"
back at the hospital again  strong contractions and trying to stop labor again  it looks like god is going to keep this baby coming 
"finished at the perinatilist  baby jayden looks great and is fully developed, so the doc said if the contractions keep going, there is no need to stop them anymore  so, hopefully, jayden will be here soon "
"well, we have made it to 36 weeks and no baby yet  my original vote was for jayden to be born within the next week  the baby has dropped quite a bit  so we still wait for our newborn son     "
"angel and i have been at the hospital since 1 am with contractions that she finally couldn't handle  tried to stop contractions, yet again, and it failed  she ha thinned out some more  stay tuned    oh yeah, full <propfemale> is on tuesday"
still trying to stop her contractions    really irritated  just let her have the baby already!!!!
we are back in the hospital and this time it is time!!!!  angel is in active labor this morning!!!! baby will be born today!!!!
<propmale> will be buying the krispy kreme donuts!!
