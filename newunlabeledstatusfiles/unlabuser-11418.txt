is bored and missing <propfirst> - thank god i'm not going to be in florida all by myself until july!
is staying up to see if being 27 feels any different than being 26

"the stress is killing me     life is so up in the air right now   it doesn't help that <propfirst> left this evening for a week at sea, either     though knowing he is going to have the time of his life hanging out with his team mates and diving helps a bit    "
