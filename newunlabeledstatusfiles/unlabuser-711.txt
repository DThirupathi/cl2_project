"just sittin here thinkin   man   i swear, everytime i think about my sister it just hits me that i'm never gonna see her again, that shit hurts, sittin there watching my daddy tell the kids hurt the worst   i don't even feel the same right now   i didn't think you can cry till you  can't cry anymore and still be crying, i don'[t even think it's set all the way in yet  love you <propfemale>  "
fighting back tears    remembering the years  
"@my family:  i love you all more than you will ever know    if you happen to read this, which i hope you all do, even though i may be terrible at showing it at times, i really do  being the introvert i always have been it's so easy to bottle all my emotions up and keep them inside, especially during these past couple of days   i appreciate everyone coming together but why did it have to be because of this???"
"never trust what you hear, lies wait around every corner for the fool who comes looking for them, disguised so cleverly you'll never doubt it, unbeknownst that what was promised, you'll never see it   "
"superior mindstate, still shy  but go ham anyday  1-way vocabulary loquational skills scary but the very fact  is that  you'll never understand  misinterpretations foreshadow delusion of the shallow  the keen know to follow mind schemes, only those whose can apply should reply know what i mean???"
"the debaucle to which no amount of frustration and meditation can solve, the labyrinth of synapses sending the mind as a projectile through a celestial-scale journey of everything you've been conditioned to know, that which you don't and that which you'll never know, random and unpredictable as to when and where this instant transmission will land you   "
makes scholars say i got all the <propfemale>  
"sees all the drama, personal problems, and senseless debauchery people subject themselves to on a daily basis, the imbalamce of their life and the need for people to just look in the mirror and figure out what it really is that's wrong with them   because it's never the things people blame it on  "
prides himself on the simple complexities so drastically overlooked that even the superficial don't see what's right in front of their eyes so awkwardly obvious   is eternally gracious for the logistics he has come to realize that a lot of people won't come to realize what it's like to be blessed like this 
   and admires the humility required to actually not detach from the immensely diverse personalities down to every individual denizen of this world with the notion that this separates me from you   while actually knowing that it does      s n   egregious conceptions are encouraged to be elaborated upon 
"gettin high  that's every blunt, new whip  that's every month, get my money on the back end  all i do is front, get it in that's every monute, get it in that's every hour, get it in at any store  yea i'm whippin any powder   - jeezy"
"the next step, as always, may seem unclear in the beginning if a person doesn't really know themselves and what they really want in life   for the next step is always a suprise "
what's on my mind?  something that'll never cross yours 
"up wit the birds, insomniatic wit a loss for words, feet to the street  huggin them curbs "
fuck the lakers  
"back wit a vengance, but aint never left the scene  reprimandated for statements so obscene, loathe superficiality my observations are keen, so frivulous to the trials and tribulations of my regime   these beings, underlings in my intellectual kingdom, oblivious to the actual connotation of freedom"
"feels like he has the power to do whatever the fuck he wants to do, just needs to figure out what he wants to do  "
confusingly simple yet so simply complicated
"fooled will be thine eyes of mine, or even of yours, to fall for the brightness you see in what may appear to be a dime diamond, yet to feel it's shine, proves it's worth "
emotionless gazes into unwitting faces of the subjects with which i make my observations confirm the mystery of trying to conceive what you realize you'll never understand about me   vague body language concealing dilemmas some will never face or even realize that i'm going through this   a worry-less demeanor battling demons in a chess-game of championship moves  
"meanwhile, stupid wild goin svedka bound, touchdown and parties gather round, profound profiles mesh <propmale> styles into clash of the <propfemale> ability to erupt to rage or situation-accordingly wise words spoken with strangers who bond and relate to me, strange looks from those i don't entertain, i hear they hate me, the quality you lack and how i do it so greatly    "
nah nigga what's on your mind??
"1 way = you better go nigga, dey got us  (hear a lot of people saying that shit, think you should know what it means)"
"can't believe some of the milestones under the belt, can't wait to reach others, learns from every one he doesn't reach, and is thankful for those who won't yet come to realize what blew right past them   they won't believe until i show you   "
"great day, guaped out, hella shelled, jiggin outrageous, phone jumpin, steady choosin, 1st of the month, debt free, s s   level 10, family straight, full stomach, fresh fit and 59-50 fitted i'm goin in tonight!!!!      swag wit my round we svedka bound   "

"dolo:  that's how it's been that's how it's gone be    everyday out here by my damn self, never hard to find  fuck everybody, and fuck you if you wanna take shit personal   yea i'm talking to you   "
having a simple goal can undermine the most determined efforts of the lost to use negativity to bring you to a place similar to where they can't seem to escape feeling comfort in <propfirst> unwise to the fact of what these indivuduals understand and utilize further trapping them slowly but surely   to my family and others similar i want you all to think about that  
"the bullshit and bitch ass people in this world, snitchin ass niggas think i done forgot, motherfuckers who run they mouth but won't do shit, the motivation that'll make a nigga wanna be a bitch, the strength of my fam just know we the shit    i'll steal for em, kill for em, shit gone get real for em, lurkin in these streets everyday, man who really want em???"
"super <propfirst> ham hock pound o' grease on the samich he a knee-slappin shebangbang never thought i'd make it this far still on e skatin thru states watch me coast thru your county well known like that shit in the news contractor wit that work careful clients we choose game rotten need cheat codes not to lose power ups, no cower ups these niggas so enthuused    "

steadfast and true in this corrupt environment where the adept are hated by the same ones who hate themselves for the fact you couldn't see me on your best day   quite local to the continental 48 yet so much further than you'll ever go  not even half of life's e playful eriences e playful erienced still pales you in comparison to the raw knowledge possesed   
"i got dat up all night no sleep pass the water nigga, i got dat give you a song and a beer have you drinkin and jukin, i got dat outta character tell me everything on your mind you aint never mean to talk that much, i got dat so nasty on the tongue but you love the taste   i got dat!!!!"

it may take the most complex or even the simplest situation to realize that feelings and emotions are not to be invested in this game where niggas aint trill and bitches don't keep it real   even the smallest amount can jeapordize any given aspect of well-being at any given time  not many besides family are there for the long run if you don't know who they are as you should find out   meanwhile know yourself   
"big things require an even bigger focus and train of thought  everyday starts from scratch, mentally at zero, realizing everything before now is nothing compared to how far i'm starting to go imagining where i'll be tomorrow  never doubt thoughts as they tell more about you than you know about yourself, a new avenue of knowledge today is priceless being able to picture how many more you know will come from that one  "
"if you aint ridin wit me, it's 1-800-fuck you!!!!  jeezy tell you the real  "
"is eager to prove the devotion as to how i felt in the beginning is how i've always felt, even to this day   shy tendencies tend to withdraw form what i realize is the inevitable, yet now i want you to know i'm here and as scary as it's been lately anticipating the moment i don't know what will happen when it does that i've always been here, no matter how terrible i've been at showing it   "
fuckin wit these hood chaps   they don't do nothin but sit at the store and ask you for a dollar all day

"went alabama bound for the weekend   chillin wit the fam, went ham, same nigga everywhere i go, goin back again cause i aint never been before   meanwhile back in these trenches  "
"what you want to happen and what you actually go and do can be two completely opposites if you allow them to be   that's when excuses and putting the blame on everybody else comes into play  i've made a lot of mistakes yet have always accepted responsibility for them, i just wish you could be man enough and do the same   "
"has a word for all you lowlife senseless <propmale> riders stuck so far in a nigga ass they forecast shit hatin on what you can't do    i love ya'll   i just wanna tell ya'll i was so stupid to ever get mad didn't realize yall was just doin your job  not sayin no names aint no need to do all that, i roll the loud up in your honor   "

"maturity knows no age, no gender, race or moral    maturity is the ability to understand what the word means and to be   not just act that way  "
what makes a female a bitch??
went ham and lettuce at fetish!!!
"off to a late night ponder, careful as i wander these trenches, filled with traps and failures stenches, front street get you knocked off the bat, catch me in the ground,  follow gutter routes like a rat, step light or the next step might cause you to wreck, secure all perimeters and keep contacts in check, respect goes a long way, especially the kind you earn, life's lesson's all around me, i sit back and learn "
lol real niggas bump swv!!!!! (sisters wit voices nigga)   
"some moments need to written, recorded or else-wise put in stone for the sole purpose of remembering and recapturing the emotions and specific thoughts at that moment as a foundation in building an on-going an determined effort towards those specific thoughts and emotions as i remember so vividly the simple past-time of smoking and going from something that didn't mean that much, merely for the sensation but"
easily avoidable to something that became quite enjoyable and slowly but surely became an everyday habit to the determination to smoke the best and even more of it as much as possible is the same reason i quit just now 
feels so good     to be so hood!!!
a perfect vocabulary can't even help you pronounce some of the names these young people givin their babies   that shit should be against the law

mental compilations relax tempting sensations to digress from what you know you shouldn't be doing  
", a kaleidescope of culture, humility, a perfectly controllable endless rage constantly tempting it's release, street and even more book smarts, vocabularistic swag so outrageous in the gutters cussin and slang to grammatical perfection and an astounding array of words, and an ability to look you dead in the eye and see what you'll never understand  "
fuck the cowboys and the redskins!!
anxious as to what's in store for me    contemplating and steady growing more inportantly
"i'm goin in! fuck it, i'm goin in!! like an illiterate nigga hope i never see a pen!!!"
i hate a liar  
some people won't appreciate what they don't realize what they have until they see that the next person won't do it like that    
coming to understand i got a serious temper like the purest form of evil catching myself thinking devilish thoughts not hard to control but almost impossible to not acknowledge  
";shy natured  won't say too much, makes heavy observations"
"'s new attitude, so suddenly occuring  it's capable to elude even my mind if i don't mentally rewind and make milestones, cultural drones don't know what's going on, if it's not in the here and now  my history's long, intellectually strong  i merely roam looking to convert lost souls trapped in the wrong  "
"lyrical e playful ressions elicit sensations; sudden rushes of adrenaline it's like you can actually feel the synergy surge through you as the strongest muscles happen to be can you feel it in your back as an electric feeling sends a euphoric healing throughout your innermost dwellings understanding my words it have a hold on you now, just tell me how does it feel??"
"it's true that a sincerely positive outlook shines throughout not only the one radiating such a brilliant energy but also those so lucky to be within reach of such an <propfemale>, realizing that multiple beliefs and morals are based on the same sole basic interpersonal congregiously based facts these uncanny individuals possess  reiterations from peers reflect mutual mindsets "
"strong body; strong mind, strong everything"
stupid dumb night   
"she just tryin make it, so she right here gettin naked  i don't judge her, i don't judge her, but i can never love her    "

"man i love my team, man i love my team   i would die for them niggas, i'm about whatever man!!"
chillin like oh-so-hard glazed gaze glistening like a krispy-kreme!!
"got drunk last week, got fucked up the other day and got bent yesterday, i'm gettin kinky-twisted tonight    2 4 lokos down you can say i'm 8 crazy!!"
"they say i <propfemale> crazy conversations but i learn alot from confused faces, lost thought we was on the same <propfemale> i'm a couple chapters ahead silly rabbit"
slippin
"re-vampin the gameplan, can't believe the things i used to do and how i changed, hard to tell that i'm the same man, back to the basics, strangers stress the talent i was blessed with; say i'm a damn fool if i waste it"
quite contagious is the power of creative outragousness!
"2 15 98-11 26 10   r i p  prince   been a long time, had a good run, lol if there's a dog heaven i know you on row 1 "

"froze toes out roamin got my situation swole, why is it you won't miss me til you realize i'm gone   strong minds seem angry when looking from behind, never worried bout yours too tied up with mine  i sit too high to stoop that low, why think of what was when you can let it go and go?? words to live by"

"quite pensive on the late night tip opportunities don't present themselves without a mind like this i stress the truth fakeness never gets you anywhere doors that always been open aren't enough i could care less but digress i do from my central theme quiet natured if i wasn't i'd be targeted for schemes, make connections then toss em like i don't even know you only way you'd understand is if i break down and show you"
quite silly to think that one could be the one but no ties make positions past placed out to crumbs the best is what i'm used to and i can't settle for less one quality isn't enough if you don't have the rest mindsets set the day can't wake up feeling down when looking back on old conquests no wonder i'm profound   
can't stop till these gears of insight take a break but breaking souls into debris and knowing you did it is great disguise schemes through a awesome personality and laughter but the power of the almighty dollar is what i'm after   
money makes moves broke cowards always lose!!  petty bitches wanting handouts in the way please move!!
"piercing perceptiveness, attitude at times devilish"
"no time for the friend zone, i'm tryna score i want the end zone  that's the game that i was taught, reel em in or run em off!!"
