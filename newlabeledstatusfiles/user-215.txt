2010-08-16 17:45:25 wish i was home with the boyfriend we barley see each other anymore since our work hours are different
2010-07-19 22:59:27 why do people try to friend you when they don't know the person they are trying to befriend when they know that when that person goes on that they will just ignore the person  never invite someone to your profile that you do not know if you question send them a message if you can or just ignore them but don't add anyone you don't know because you could regret it later
2010-08-27 01:57:31 at house of beer right now
