2010-06-18 03:50:33 "father's day is approaching..yellow roses grow in heaven, lord pick a bunch for me. place them in my daddy's hands and tell him they're from me. tell him that i love and miss him. when he turns to smile, place a kiss upon his cheek & hold him for awhile, because remembering him is easy, i do it every day. there's an ache in my heart that will never go away... if your dad is in heaven, copy & paste this"
2010-06-18 15:38:51 "got <propfirst>'s flowers for father's day yesterday...waiting on them to be delivered today...i think it would make him proud to know that i went with guy colors and not pink lol...i could talk him into almost anything but the color pink, i tried painting the office pink, tried ordering pink shrits and hats, and tried to get him to buy a pink 18 wheeler and he just wouldn't have it lol...good times and great memories!!!"
2010-03-23 02:43:27 "thought for the day: never tell someone ""everything happens for a reason"" unless you can back it with the information that its either for the bad or the good. if you cant give that kinda information to go with the saying then dont say it at all, because it becomes a pointless statement and an endless waiting game."
2010-09-12 01:47:32 <propfirst> dunn just walked on stage...hell yeah!!!
2010-07-06 14:01:13 "is going off the mnt. then back home to swim, swim, swim, swim, and swim  smile "

2010-03-30 19:02:06 "...all u folks think i've got my price, at which i'll sell all that is mine. u think money rules when all else fails, go sell ur soul and keep ur shell. i'm trying to protect  what i keep inside, all the reasons y i live my life..."

2010-04-27 20:38:40 there r many people n this county who choose not 2 vote & yet voice their opinion on how it should be ran & by who. just a reminder if u don't vote u give up the right 2 have a political opinion. by the way the stunt pulled over <propfirst> cleek & <propmale> myers at a little known store n <propfirst> was very tacky & childish...i think we all know these men will come running 2 protect us no matter the out come of this election!
2010-04-28 02:06:25 its sad when u ride through this small little town and see that there are more cars at the local bar than at the local stores...and people wonder why grundy is a poor county.

2010-06-25 15:43:59 there is a prayer intended 2give strength 2ppl faced w/circumstances they donâ€™t <propfemale>t 2accept.the power of the prayer comes from it's insight n2human nature. because so many of us rage against the hand that life has dealt us.because so many of us give n2despair when faced w/an impossible choice.the good news 4those who utter these words is that god will hear u& answer ur prayer.thebadnewsisthatsometimestheanswerisno.

2010-06-08 17:02:56 "thought 4 the day: everybody in this community has something to hide. u know how difficult it is to hide anything in a small commuity . everybody knows everybody else's business, but u don't know all of it. so this makes for a very paranoid place."

2010-06-27 17:03:11 "i've heard thats it's possible to grow up. i've just never met anyone who has actually done it. w/o parents to defy, we break the rules we make for ourselves. we throw tantrums when things don't go our way. we whisper secrets with our best friends in the dark. we look for comfort where we can find it. and we hope against all logic, against all e playful erience. like childern we never give up hope."
2010-10-17 23:54:43 "much to my dismay, my laundry did not sort, wash, dry, and put its self away. you would think after the long talk we had this morning that it would have done as i had asked. yes, i'm the psycho who has full on conversations with inadament objects."
