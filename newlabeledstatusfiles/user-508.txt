2011-01-16 15:15:15 it's a beautiful day to check out the omaha zoo!
2010-12-04 07:00:45 "congratulations, airman <propmale>   you've earned this (badge) as much as the rest of us "
2011-01-05 14:28:42 "i love you too, component cable!"
2010-10-15 02:40:04 "so, i have a lot saved up from my austere lifestyle, and now i find myself at a crossroads question:  should i buy a car when i go on leave soon?"
2010-10-21 23:40:56 "dang unit compliance inspection!  it hasn't even gotten here yet, and i already hate it "
2010-09-26 21:51:09 "dang!  i gave myself half an hour to get in uniform for gi party, and it took me 8 minutes   and i was trying to take my time, too!"
2010-10-26 22:45:08 "every week since i joined the air force has been at the very least a minor adventure, and at the very most a constant stream of triumph turmoil   i got almost exactly what i wanted, without it being at all what i e playful ected "
2010-11-22 23:27:20 "in 50 hours, 31 minutes, and 26 seconds, i'll be seeing my family for the first time in 6 months   it's gonna be the best thanksgiving ever!"
2010-11-09 00:05:45 nothin' like a trip to the gym to bring you back to reality!
2010-11-20 01:26:50 "99 1 out of 100 on my pt test   now, i am faced with the burden of squadron-wide rmtd   hopefully, it at least causes some people to think before they drink underage during the next few weeks "
2010-10-28 02:27:19 "and just like that, i'm moved from connor manor in the 332nd, to <propmale> manor in the 338th   only time will tell what's in store for me next "
2010-12-13 23:02:06 "can't   hold   on   much   looooongerrrrrrrr!actually, i think i can make it another 2-4 days   it's just gonna be really tight trying to in-process, get my leave set up, and get ready for christmas in the space of 4 days "
2010-11-27 05:50:51 "man, this week has been the most educational of 'em all!  i never realized it, but i make a comparable leader, and i make my family proud eh, still not so sure 'bout that first one "
2010-11-30 03:28:32 "unless i can get a hold of flight medical tomorrow, there's no way i'll be outta here this week!why isn't anything ever as it should be?"
2010-12-18 01:08:27 "unless something really cool happens, i'm gonna be spending the night in atlanta hmm, i can't believe my outlook is so bleak right now "
2010-12-24 01:27:32 "okay, so i won't be on leave nearly as long as i thought   but i'm still going home tomorrow, and that's what counts i'll be on leave until january 2nd   i'll let everybody know when i'll be in each area, but my time in melbourne got cut out, and i'm not stopping in kansas city but for lunch "
2010-11-18 23:36:20 "after spendin' so much time here, i thought i would be used to seein' a batch of friends leave   now that my class has graduated without me, it just doesn't seem quite the same good luck on your first assignments, guys!  none of you need it "
2011-01-21 17:20:04 holy crap!  they just ordered my 3d cdcs!  they'll be here in 1-4 weeks!
2010-12-28 03:07:23 this is the best christmas ever!  and we still haven't opened the gifts!
2010-01-01 06:57:42 just when i think it can't get any better   
2010-12-07 01:40:39 "man, i am soooo close to leaving keesler for offutt!  at this point, i've done all i can, and i'm just waiting for everyone else to get their rears in gear "
2010-12-21 15:25:21 "man, i love getting visits from family   it's almost as good as going to visit them!"
2011-01-22 04:01:15 just found out that the base plays taps at 2200   that's nice   i would've really enjoyed it at keesler 
2010-11-21 13:39:43 "everybody goin' to new york for the <propfemale>'s thanksgiving day parade, make sure you have the time of your life, and that you get enough sleep to remember everything!"
2010-12-12 01:35:30 don't look at me in that tone of voice or i'll deafen your eyesight!  it smells a funny color 
2010-01-02 04:38:13 "i was told that a hard part of going on leave is seeing people after a year or so and finding that while you've gone through a body and soul overhaul, everyone else is doing exactly what they were doing when we left   i am relieved to say that everyone i've seen is doing something new and exciting!(and best of all, everyone is telling me how proud of me they are!)"
2010-11-21 01:18:14 "wow, we all went out there thinkin', ""today is gonna suck ""  but then, something snapped, and we all turned rmtd into something fun man, i can't believe i just said that "
2010-01-02 21:18:56 "back in blue springs, if only for a little while!"
2011-01-13 04:43:03 "i think for about the 4th time, i've found a new niche "
2010-12-07 23:01:44 "i have my flight physical appointment!  on next tuesday   if i'm not out of here by next friday, i think i'm gonna have a nervous breakdown "
2011-01-10 12:13:12 "what?  no blues today?  but that's the highlight of my week!eh   not when my birthday is on friday "
2010-12-24 23:47:58 just saw dad for the first time in 14 months!  i got all tear eyed 
2010-11-28 21:29:08 "never again must i try to go that long without seeing family   same goes for leaving my magic cards at home and working out i haven't been to the gym since wednesday!"
2011-01-12 05:19:10 "when you end your day by preparing for tomorrow, it should (and most likely will) be a good day "
2011-01-07 17:44:20 "dang it, i thought i was finally done with wakin' up late!  i guess if you aren't ready for it, life just loves to throw a curve ball your way "
2011-01-21 05:42:53 is considering protein supplements   extremely tentatively 
2011-01-04 13:05:57 nothin' like a fire drill at 0645 to clear out <propfemale> sinuses in the mornin'!
2011-01-18 20:21:49 first day of squadron pt   i'll bet it's at least 9001% better than keesler!
2011-01-14 21:25:04 is no longer a teenager!
2011-01-17 22:39:05 i like the guy who did the plumbing for this building's style   the optimum <propfemale> for standing up to pee in the toilets is always exactly 30 degrees to the right from where you're standing 
2011-01-07 04:11:55 "man, if i can't stop spillin' stuff on my carpet, my dorm'll never stop smellin' like spot shot "
2010-12-24 21:52:38 "made it to michigan!  just waitin' with grandma for <propfemale> and dad at the airport   come on, time   i don't ask for much, just speed up for me, just this once!"
2011-01-11 18:20:40 "news flash   my phone charger finally crapped out on me   in about 18 hours, i'll be without phone or internet until i figure something out "
2011-01-13 22:06:34 amazing power nap   i can't believe how comfortable my chair is 
2011-01-20 23:56:29 first day at work went really well   i just wish they'd give me some real work already 
2011-01-21 15:23:58 "1 mile run to the gym at -3 degrees+pt with the squadron for forty minutes+1 mile run back+2 hot pop tarts+1 cool shower  equals my kinda morning!"
2011-01-24 04:54:33 "okay, i've been on the same profile picture for 4 months now   somebody needs to recommend a profile picture to me, or at least take a picture of me so i have a better picture than this one   it's a good picture, it's just time for a change "
2011-01-09 22:24:42 snow!
2010-01-02 22:21:00 chipotle!!!
2011-01-18 18:18:02 "man, this is one weird week "
2011-01-17 03:51:56 "i have the gift of speed   quick feet, quick thinking, and if you put something in my hands, my fingers spark   i only wish it didn't make everyone else seem too slow to wait for "
