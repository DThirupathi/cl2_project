2011-09-14 22:58:35 washington was awesome - got a lot of good work done but only had 3 hours of free time so went into the city - asked at the hotel about getting a ticket for the washington monument - no problem it's free....it's also closed because of structural damage (be nice if they'd shared that before my $50 cab fare!) so could go look but only from the bottom! did go through to the <propmale> memorial though - i knew he was a tall man but that tall  wink

2011-09-25 21:13:32 the unsubscribe option will be getting used liberally - getting really fed up with all these status updates that should really be notes. you know that new option that allows you to pick your audience? well if your status is going to be a 5000character essay use that option - i don't want to see it! and if you're upset by that delete me and we'll both get on with our lives.

2010-10-23 13:31:53 "virgin mobile - just been <propmale> by their own lies. in august i paid off and canceled my contract - they continued sending bills, i disputed them, they now claim i called them on 5/10/10 to reactivate the account - now that's a good trick since i was in icu wired up to all the machines that go '<propfemale>' if i moved a finger! virgin mobile- you've been caught!"

2010-06-08 11:35:04 "the uk tax man just gave me money back.....yes you read it right - they gave me money back and it wasn't a piddling amount. if you moved outside the uk in the last financial year it mght be well worth your time getting a tax review and before anyone sends begging letters, she who must be obeyed knows about it so you've no <propmale> for you!"
2010-06-15 19:28:50 why do all these so called football stars get paid so much - so far all i've seen is crap. they're obviously beleiving their own legends. north korea get a fekkin bag or rice for playing and they're so far as good if not better than brazil!

2010-06-15 20:18:48 "jeez the english sports commentators will clutch at any straw to mention 1966 - north korea being in the tournament this year is a gift to them since their last appearance was 1966! shut the fuck up about it, in case you hadn't noticed england aren't playing- look up this date 15/4/67 (home championships - wembley)"
2010-11-03 22:48:55 "virgin mobile finally admitted they got it wrong saying i'd called to activate my account while lying in icu - they've ""graciously"" canceled the <propmale> and closed the account - amazing what you can get them to do when they've been caught out in a blatant lie."
2010-09-26 17:41:33 "too much time on my hands today -is it just me or is that new ikea ad with all the cats really saying ""ever wondered what that smell was? well we let cats piss all over the furniture at night so you can get  the pungent aroma of ammonia in your home"""

2010-06-22 17:05:47 "so it looks like the libs got a fair amount of their 20:20 tax policy in but i fail to understand the phrase ""emergency budget"" - if it's an emergency why are they waiting for 6 months to activate it? (not that i want it sooner) smacks of the old trick of give them bad news months in advance so that we can load a wee bit more bad news on them later! - wonder what's coming next"
2010-12-19 09:56:41 panic over - have my travel home planned like a military operation except for one minor detail...managed to lose the ferry booking reference (don't bother berating me i've been already done it) - until 10 minutes ago i was going nowhere! been on hold with p&o since 08:45 to get that damned reference!

2010-08-27 18:15:14 "i suppose like most people i have my routines and there are certain things in the world that can be taken as constant and immutable - imagine my confusion then when i went to the local indian take away tonight to see it being run by a chinese couple! i did go back outside and read the sign again!  smile   but now my world has been shaken, i can't be sure about anything now"
2010-08-20 16:07:42 "decisions, decision...tomorrow go west to the wild coast of achill and 80% <propmale> or rain and spectacular <propmale> walks or wimp out and go east to wicklow and 25% <propmale> of rain? of course option 3 is available...do sod all, all weekend"

2010-10-18 17:13:14 "in a complete contrast to the eejit dr that asked me why i was there (after my heart attack) my regular gp came back today from holiday - obviously to a very full day of catch up and appointments but still finds time to call personally to talk over my recent ""event"" - take a lesson eejit dr"
2010-09-22 17:01:26 "watched ""devil"" last night - wasn't particularly impressed but i did hesitate this afternoon when the elevator in apartment block  foyer opened as i approached it - empty and uncalled lol but then as i was the only one in it ....that means i am the devil! mwahaha"
