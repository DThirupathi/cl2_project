2009-08-16 05:01:47 "at work.  slow, calm night.  no drama.  except for the damn low volume, but high pitched wailing sound coming from the fire system...  almost like a meditation exercise."
2009-08-14 17:52:15 "have to go back to work tonight...  had a wonderful week off.  went to lake <propfirst>, hiked up tongue mountain, got another year older, and spent time with an old friend.  all ends too quickly."

2009-09-26 08:11:25 is trying not to smoke and going crazy.
2009-09-27 04:00:54 on day 2 plus 3 hrs since last cig smoked.   i did this all once before a few years ago and don''t remember it being as difficult.  but i will get it done.
2009-09-28 22:33:42 "so, getting near the end of day three in my quest to give up smoking and go without a cigarette longer than my friend who i am in a contest with... coincidentally though, i am noticing that i have had an increased amount of pain in my left knee since i stopped.  not sure what to do about it either.  thought, suggestions?"
2009-10-08 21:00:51 "is not feeling very well today.  possible ear infection (ouch!), on and off fever, tired, dizzy.... and at work to top it off.  and it seems just about every guest is lacking in the area of common sense which is more aggravating when one isn't feeling well."
2009-09-04 12:09:09 heading to bed.  have to work the graveyard shift tonight.  hope fully it'll be slow tonight.  i want to try and get some shopping in before work and stop at my sister's to visit.  good night and good morning all.

2010-02-06 06:09:36 "sitting at work, reading a book, waiting for the last reservation of the night before i can do my audit.  been sniffling, sneezing, coughing and wheezing all week, and my dad's in the hospital.  can't visit him while i am sick, which should be obvious to some, but my sister gives me a hard time over it.  am i wrong not to visit my father who had surgery in the hospital when i am sick?"
2010-02-07 05:04:27 "so, i felt better today and went to see my dad in the hospital.  it's amazing how a hospital bed can make a person seem smaller, almost as if what made them ill has shrunk them in some way.  it's a difficult sight to see.  other than that though, he seemed to be doing well and is e playful ected to be discharged tomorrow morning."
2010-02-12 03:16:58 "only an hour left at work.  dad's been home since sunday, doing okay so far.  got approved for a week off of work in march to go to florida with my sister, her husband, her friend, <propfemale>, and <propfemale>'s three children, <propmale>, <propfemale>, and <propfirst>.  i am hoping too that my friend and his daughter will be able to go as well.  i am really looking forward to going!"
2010-02-10 01:17:32 "so, dad came home from the hospital on sunday and seems to be doing okay.  made spaghetti w/meatballs, sausage, and garlic bread last night.  came out pretty good, although, not sure if it is actually possible to mess those up.  sitting at work now, doing <propfemale>, so a lil bored.  think i might go and play some wow."
2009-10-20 00:56:54 go angels!  i'm not a laa fan... i just hate nyy.
2010-02-17 03:23:30 "at work, struggling valiantly to keep my eyes open.  long weekend w/o enough sleep today.  and it wasn't even the good type of long weekend.   sad   can't wait to go home and snuggle up under my covers and sleeeep."
2009-10-21 01:19:44 "tried to do something that was the right thing and won't let anyone, ""friend"" or not make her feel guilty for it."
2009-11-20 16:15:28 "today, i am thankful for my parents, even as nutty as they are, and my sister who is there for me as often as she can be.."
2010-03-18 21:48:32 "last night at work before going on vacation.  i am excited about getting away for a while.  have some last minute laundry and things to do, then packing.  hoping for a great time away."
2010-08-03 12:39:40 ever feel like you just left work and are back already?
2011-01-21 17:24:04 i think that worse than getting only 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep is getting 3 hours of interrupted sleep.  going to be a looong f'n day.

2010-06-04 20:50:19 "last day of working with the new hire & honestly, i am relieved.  this kid seems to be lacking in any form of common sense; it's really aggravating.  i try to be patient, but the questions he's asking could be answered by a few children i know.  makes me want to tear my hair out."

2010-10-19 10:36:48 hurt my thumb on my left hand the other day somehow.  not sure how i did it; just woke up and it was hurting whenever i move it.  and there's some swelling down by the joint where thumb meets palm.
2010-07-17 03:06:15 "so my ""best friend"" decided to end a 17 year friendship over reasons he can't seem to communicate.  apparantly, i should be able to read his mind and just know why, but while i do feel i have good intuition, this does not make me a mind reader.  so, the only thing i can conclude is that he wasn't really my friend at all."
2010-07-04 20:23:10 "went to maconchies (sp?) yesterday with <propmale>, rachyl, <propfemale>, connor, and <propmale>.  swam in the pool, felt good.  unfortunately got some more sunburn, and yes, i did use sunblock.  hurting quite a bit today and very tired."

2010-08-29 04:11:34 "disturbed at big day out was great!! so was halestorm, stone sour, and avenged sevenfold."
2010-07-19 05:05:45 "ok, so tonight at work wasn't too bad cause it was slow, but tomorrow night will be a different story... more check ins, more walk ins, more phone calls, more senseless questions...shouldn't that mean more money per hour?   wink "
2010-08-08 21:41:59 "i miss my former friend who i loved as much as i love my sisters and his daughter, but i am not going to play guessing games either.  be straight up and honest with me or don't bother in the first place."
2010-07-28 19:10:14 "just got out of work. (yeah!) it was a hot, tired day.  now when i get home though i have to empty the cats' boxes-yuck!  but then gonna relax and go to bed early."

2010-07-30 14:19:40 "ok, i work in a hotel called microtel... anyone with an ounce of sense could probably guess that the rooms are smaller than in most hotels.. yet it never ceases to amaze me the number of people who e playful ress suprise or dismay over the smallness of the rooms... and this even from people who book online where there is access to pics for a person to see"
2010-07-31 15:59:41 "ate at <propmale>'s diner in watervliet and found a hair under my omelet. i handed it to my waitress and told her about it, but was done anyway. she asked if i wanted it wrapped!"

2010-01-01 21:21:24 "i cannot believe the level of disrespect being brought to my sister and brother-in-law's home with fights, drinking, pot smoking, trashing the basement, and a lack of following rules they set down with all they have tried to do to help certain teens. makes me very upset since i love my sister more than anyone and don't like seeing her disrespected, especially not in her own home."
2010-08-30 16:19:42 having lunch at red robins with my mother
2010-07-23 01:37:15 a bit upset about a lot of things lately.. which apparantly i am not allowed to e playful ress or voice an opinion about because it might upset certain people.. like the truth might upset them cause they forgot how to tell it or hear it.. better to bury it right?  pretend everything is happy?

2010-08-08 21:41:51 "so, apparantly, the source of the reason my ex best ""friend"" lied.  however, in my post yesterday, i did use the word supposedly in regards to the source.  so, i do apologize for the post, but feel that if my former friend doesn't want me hearing and believing things second hand, he should tell me what his issue is himself."

2011-01-17 09:56:27 "there's something wrong when at bed time, one tries to wend their way around their sleeping pets to avoid disturbing them."
2010-12-19 02:46:14 isn't it kind of disrespectful to call someone by a name you prefer instead of the one they prefer?
2011-01-15 03:21:08 "so tired, wanting to fall asleep right here... still got an hour left, plus drive home time... planning to sleep like 12 hours..."
2010-12-19 02:49:33 some people can be very rude.

2010-11-25 15:13:24 happy thanksgiving everyone.
2011-01-20 03:37:33 nothing like being scheduled 20 days in a row between two jobs to make a person feel tired looong before the end of said 20 days.
2010-01-01 21:00:53 i feel that if certain teenagers want to be treated like grownups they should act with the maturity of grownups...
2011-01-17 05:42:29 tired.. going to bed.  night all.
2011-01-25 20:24:53 i just woke up an hour ago and already i want a nap... it probably didn't help that i didn't go to bed til 8 this morning...
2011-01-24 09:40:59 16 days in a row and counting.. and tired
2011-01-16 23:22:59 "still feel lil blah today, but the hours are moving along.  and i don't work too much!   smile "
2011-01-29 13:56:30 "day off today and tomorrow.  yeeeayy!  some extra sleep, a bit of shopping, maybe catch a movie.."
2011-01-18 23:53:54 "insane night at work.  none stop phone and check ins for the better part of 3 hours.  have to spend the night at work cause the roads are too messed up and dammit i don't have my laptop.  not to mention, i prefer my own bed and blankie."
2011-01-04 20:18:56 "day off... home relaxin.. had things i wanted to do today, but short on fuel.. so have to put that stuff off for another day off"

2011-01-28 05:21:16 i love it when my bank f's up and i can't get access to my funds til the next day.
2011-02-18 21:07:04 "ever notice someone's help can actually be more of a hindrance?  i can handle doing what i need to do and if i do need help i will ask.  but even when i do, it is not an invitation to take over."
2011-02-19 05:23:16 "tired, tummy ache, fever, going to try and sleep now..."

2011-02-28 23:29:51 hate it when people say something and then contradict themselves in the same sentence..
2011-03-01 00:11:18 amazing how talking to an adult can sometimes seem so similar to taking to a child... or make me feel like a dentist trying to pull teeth...
2011-03-02 11:56:19 how is it possible to love and hate a movie all at the same time?
2011-03-03 02:24:52 "you little b, how dare you accuse my sister of causing you instability.  after she let you into her home & all she asked was that you work or go to school & you couldn't handle either.  nor did you help around the house."

2011-03-12 22:42:41 "hungry, hungry, what to have for dinner..... thinkin a ribeye from chilli's...  slllooooow night at work"
2011-03-12 23:34:21 wondering when my dinner decisions became the business of anyone other than myself or my doctor to decide whether what i eat is good or bad...
2011-03-14 07:24:03 just got home from a workout at a gym i just joined.  trying to work towards getting myself healthier.  here's to hopin' i can stick with it & do what i need to do to succeed.
2011-03-14 07:25:40 "most people have at least 200 friends on facebook, but when it comes to needing a ""friend"" to talk to how many will actually be there for you? i can guarantee not even half of your facebook ""friends"" will like this. like this status if you'll be there for me. set this as your status and see which friends are there for you.."
2011-03-16 01:18:20 "the one you just called fat, has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs. the one you just called stupid, has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night. the one you just called ugly, spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her. the one you just tripped, is abused enough at home. there's a lot more to people than you think. put this as your status if you're against bullying!!"
2011-03-17 05:51:52 how do you find a way to honor someone who used to bully you and hit you when they were being paid to take care of you?

2011-04-09 21:33:43 have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour. i know the ones who will. think of the ones you know or love who has/had cancer. my prayer is that 2011 a cure will be found. will you post it for 1 hour? do it for all. there are too many to mention who have fought & who are fighting. i hope to see this in all the statuses of my friends. just for an hour

2011-09-24 17:24:45 "just had to pass this along!! >>>>>>>>>a mother passing by her daughter's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. then she saw an envelope propped up prominently on the center of the bed. it was addressed, ""mom."" with the worst premonition, she opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands: dear mom: it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you. i had to elope with my new boyfriend because i wanted to avoid a scene with dad and you. i've been finding real passion with <propmale> and he is so nice-even with all his piercings, tattoos, beard, and his motorcycle clothes. but it's not only the passion mom, i'm pregnant and <propmale> said that we will be very happy. he already owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. he wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too. <propmale> taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and trading it with his friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so <propmale> can get better; he sure deserves it!! don't worry mom, i'm 15 years old now and i know how to take care of myself. someday i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grand children. your daughter, <propfemale>... ps: mom, none of the above is true. i'm over at the neighbor's house. i just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than my report card that's in my desk center drawer. i love you! call when it is safe for me to come home..... copied from a facebook friend"
