2010-01-25 01:36:14 maybe i am finally starting to worry about this thing a little bit  <propfirst> 
2010-01-29 01:31:59 hey everyone  dont get upset ya all  it was just my regular mri that i have to get every year  i was a little worried because my doc  thought it might be growing since i am in early menopause  it hasnt grown or shrunk  it is the same as far as they can tell  sometimes they can grow so slightly that they dont see it on the mri 
2010-01-18 21:28:25 head hurts!! so sick of having a headache!! i wish they would take this tumor out of my head!!!
2010-02-03 23:19:25 hey all! my sweet <propfirst> <propfirst> is 5yrs old!!! time really flys by! dont forget the b-day party for him this saturday at 330  my out of town people can come if they need a short vacation  your more than welcome to stay with us  i know it is highly unlikely but thought i would try!!
