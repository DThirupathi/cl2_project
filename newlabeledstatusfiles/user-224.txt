2010-03-08 08:18:39 """knowledge is power,"" huh? that's a load of misleading bollocks, right there.  it should say ""particular knowledge is particular power.""  though, even that is a kind of paradox.  you have to understand it before you can understand it."

2010-02-20 01:50:11 "is even more impressed by how graciously <propfirst> lysacek is handling his victory than by the performance he gave to earn it.  whatever emphasis typical americans place on national pride in olympic competition, i hope they take note of this guy's attitude.  then maybe we can move closer to living up to all those grandiose titles we give our country."
2010-03-10 08:36:50 "<propfirst> brand, <propmale> gervais... is there some specific cockney category of british comedy that i'm not aware of?  i love it."
2010-03-01 03:10:35 "oh, all the comrades e'er i had,  they're sorry for my going away, and all the sweethearts e'er i had, they'd wish me one more day to stay, but since it falls unto my lot, that i should go and you should not, i gently rise and softly call, good night and joy be with you all."
