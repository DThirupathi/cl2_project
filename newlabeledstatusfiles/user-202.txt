2010-05-07 16:16:41 "okay so b/c of that stupid medicine i had to get some teeth pulled on friday...i'm just getting around to where i can talk and don't need an ice pack every second of every day. i can easily say that it was worse that labour! some of the teeth roots that came out were almost an inch long! i kept a couple, i'll have to take some pics this weekend. the worst of it is, he didn't even finish!"
