"per my weight! i know recall all the things i hate about being thin: swimsuits have no room for tits, jeans have no crotches, no one takes you seriously about how much meds you need (well, they don't always do that when ur fat either, but they're more likely to), and men don't just look at you they ogle you like they want to start licking you right there in the middle of aisle 7. ugh."
"okay so b/c of that stupid medicine i had to get some teeth pulled on friday...i'm just getting around to where i can talk and don't need an ice pack every second of every day. i can easily say that it was worse that labour! some of the teeth roots that came out were almost an inch long! i kept a couple, i'll have to take some pics this weekend. the worst of it is, he didn't even finish!"
"i know i have fought an kicked and screamed for a long time against any use of such devices as facebook and myspace and so on and so forth. i refuse to maintain relationships through things such as this, but i will keep a <propfemale> up jic. and i promise i'll get ses to take a current photo of me so you guys can see my 'weight' progess."

"on the up side if you want a fab way to quit smoking go have 3 teeth pulled. you aren't allowed to smoke for 3 days anyway. put on the nicotine patch b4 you leave for the dentist. on the 4th day tell yourself, i did it for 3 days i can do it for 4, and so on. i'm up to 7 days and as i've been more concerned that the only part of my body that doesn't hurt is my hair, it's not been too difficult!"
"but if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin.  if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. http annoyed /bible.us/1john1.7.nkjv"
