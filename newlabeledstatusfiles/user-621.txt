2011-07-15 14:15:42 fb is being ridiculous.  it has blocked my ability to reply to all of your lovely messages.  i thank you all for the support.  it it much appreciated.   love    smile 
2011-07-16 05:12:52 "please remember to remove my <propfemale> <propmale> account from your friends lists, if you haven't already.  i've done all i can to block her from this account and to hide what won't be suspicious on the other account, but it seems it would be safer to simply remove all possibilities of an accidental post to the wrong account.thank you.   smile "
