2011-02-27 17:51:09 "hmmmmmit seems i've left all maths revision as well as an english paper question and several other pieces of homework until now.......well english is a waste of time so that's that sortedall other homework is a waste of time so that's that sortedand mr oxley is my maths teacher so i've pretty much already failed my mod 3 resit anyway...."
2011-02-28 22:15:20 "well.....i think i should probably spent at least some of tonight doing maths revisionnot the end of the world though.....there is always mod 5 to get that grade....not that i'll do any good in mod 5 either, but procrastination is just much better than revison"
2011-03-01 23:07:07 "the combination of a failed module 3 exam and an even worse tech project, despite the 7 hours spent on it today, have pretty much provided me with excellent reasons on why i havent done the numerous other tasks of the week and it is not my own faulti attempted to revise maths and do tech folder work but ultimately both failedat least it's the thought that counts....."
2011-03-06 23:02:52 "well this is another weekend spent terrorising the people of new vegas and 16th century rome and not finishing my tech folder or doing the other multiple peices of homework.......but considering my tech product consists of three willlow branches, lots of string and arcylic credit cards it doesnt really matter much folder work i do, i dont think anything can save it anymoreso a weekend well spent i think"
2011-03-08 22:17:55 "you are such a good friend that if we were on a sinking ship together and there was only one life jacket... i'd miss you heaps and think of you often.knowledge is power, and power corrupts. so study hard and be evil.to be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and call whatever you hit the target.some people hear voices.. some see invisible people.. others have no imagination whatsoever."
2011-03-10 18:48:42 "well that was a deeply uncomfortable parents evening.....for the first time since he was chucked out, my dear father decided, in his infinite wisdom, to turn up at parents evening, spent five minutes complaining then told two teachers that they taught stupid (not the words he used) subjects and he didn't know why i was taking them.....he then shouted at a teacher to hurry up and find my results then stormed off"
