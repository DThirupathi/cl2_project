2009-09-09 14:45:32 "suddenly, i have no job now, i have hardly anything in my portfolio since the last ten years was confidential work, and want to go to los <propfemale> to get a special effects job, one of the hardest things to get. how am i going to do this?"
2009-09-29 18:00:48 "is feeling good, strangely enough. got a nearly guaranteed job and an apartment in north hollywood. just gotta figure out how to not get a job here so i can collect a couple more months of unemployment."
2009-11-02 12:28:55 "yes!! ""v"" is on syfy all week! my favorite show when i was a kid. it has been 20 years or so since i last saw it. it was probably the show that most inspired me to become an fx artist. perfect timing, just when i need some inspiration........."
2009-10-27 07:20:26 skinny puppy in philly in mid nov......just when i'm broke as a joke....arrgh!
2009-12-29 02:35:36 "just saw avatar-3d. if <propfirst> <propfirst> wasn't the most famous director before(which he wasn't), he is now. the story looked kinda so-so on the commercials, but it was absolutely fantastic. everyone has to see this movie, in 3d that is, its meant to be. imax3d may be even better. this is the new 3d, its nearly perfect. you have never seen a movie like this before. truly revolutionary. go see it."
2009-12-31 22:50:47 "bored, bored, bored. i have nothing to do tonight. think i might go see avatar in imax 3d by myself......."
2010-01-23 16:46:19 "conan rules. best sign out of any show, ever. true class act."
2009-01-02 07:55:47 "imax is stupid. i will never see another imax movie again. the only good thing is that it's 70mm. it was the wrong aspect ratio, screen was 1/4 of the size i thought it was gonna be, and far less spherical. i guess i was thinking of ima laugh ome/omnimax. the 3d seemed to have less depth, but maybe it was just me. don't see avatar this way, go see it in ""regular screen"" 3d."
2010-01-21 16:10:42 "i don't have many heroes, but conan o'brien is definitely one of them now.  the rare individual with true integrity. sacrificing himself for what is right. boycott nbc!"
2010-05-28 20:27:29 "a <propmale> went hunting for bear. he walked five <propmale> east of camp, but couldn't find any game. so he walked five <propmale> north, where he saw a bear and shot it. then he walked five <propmale> directly back to camp. what color was the bear?"
2010-04-05 15:04:56 "ipad = stupid. = me losing hope in design, somebody please, get it right, it is so simple. = do i have to do it myself?"
2010-09-30 00:09:51 <propmale> giraldo dies of od.  he was the best.  the 2 best comics die in the same month. how sad.  i guess the earthworms are the ones that get the last laugh.
2010-06-26 07:50:06 "free foosball table! i am moving and need to get rid of a foosball table. anybody who wants it must pick it up before wednesday. in good shape, couple chips, bent playfield corner, but certainly good enough for a ""non-pro"", lol.  legs are off for transport, but a truck or hatchback would probably still be needed to haul. contact me asap to schedule a pick-up time as i will be in and out of town for hours at a time."
2010-05-21 06:00:48 awesome covenant show. <propfirst> myer from haujobb filled in for a missing keyboardest. unique show....
2010-06-06 10:36:46 how big is this underground oil reservoir and could it possibly lead to the extinction of humans?
2010-06-14 08:35:41 "if you remake a movie you should be banned from film-making and treated like you bet on your own team, like <propmale> <propfemale>.  the only exception is if you are the original director and you're unhappy with your first film, then remake it all you want, it's yours.  you don't see the <propfemale> <propfemale> being repainted by another artist to make it ""better"" because we have new paints......."
2010-06-14 08:35:31 "there was already a classic movie called ""the karate kid"".  there should never be another by the same name unless it has a different concept.  in the new karate kid, the kid is taught kung-fu.  call it ""the kung-fu kid"" you greedy hollywood idiots."

2010-09-02 19:36:16 "every single thing, that every single person, has ever said to you, has just been  vibrating air."

2011-03-02 00:29:25 "if the weather's nice on friday or saturday i'm going to monster makers in <propmale> for a huge bulk order pickup.  if anybody wants anything from there or wants to tag along to keep me company or check out the facility, let me know. i can work around your schedule. i'm getting 400 lbs. of <propmale> and plaster, so i'll have to keep things under the limit of my car, lol."
