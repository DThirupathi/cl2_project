the average low income adult spends $35 a month on lottery tickets for which they will never win anything. if that same adult took that same amount of money and reinvested it at the same rate in an average mutual fund it would be worth more than a million dollars by the time they are 70. so you tell me. is it <propfemale> or your own decisions that keep you down???

"a seahawks fan, a steelers fan, & a patriots fan are climbing a mountain & arguing about who loves their team the most. the patriot fan insists that he is the most loyal. ''this is for new england!'' he yells & jumps off the mountain. not to be outdone, the seahawks fan is next to profess his love for his team. he yells ""this is for seattle"" & pushes the steelers fan off the mountain. repost if you're a seahawks fan!"
