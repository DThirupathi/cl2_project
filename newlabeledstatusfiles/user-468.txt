2010-09-20 17:01:14 thought of the day: if your actions are just there is no need to justify them. second thought: if you are a good person; the opinions of others is irrelevant

2011-02-27 15:52:24 i had a murder mystery dream--but there was no mystery. i was the killer. every time i woke up in a panic and laid back to sleep; the weapon i had became less potent and more ridiculous. i ended up with a french fry.

2011-03-05 20:11:59 "this is the poem i got from my ""adopted"" sons wemek & general.""a life, a life. a mom, a wife. a friend till the end; who is always willing to lend some nice advice. simple and sweet, with cute shoes on her feet. staying cool no matter the heat. happy birthday from g and wee."" awe i love these guys  love "
2011-01-08 16:20:06 i finally got rid of that abhimanyu jerk. no thanks to facebook! i had to re-friend him just to tell him off for blowing up my cell at all hours...then facebook wouldn't let me block him for another 48 hrs for some cruel unknowable reason...your 48 hrs are up.  smile 
2010-11-26 01:06:42 so disappointed with facebook right now..i tried to put that i was in a relationship with myself but it rudely told me that i cannot create a relationship with myself...narrow!
