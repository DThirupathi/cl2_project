2010-05-14 19:45:37 i can't tell whether this is a result of global weirding or if this is just normal pittsburgh weather (which isn't so normal to begin with)...
2010-06-02 00:36:25 i hate it when what my heart wants to do goes against what my brain wants to do... it gets so confusing what to do...

2010-09-06 22:36:14 "anyone wanna e playful lain to me how to use sine, cosine, and tangent?"
2010-06-22 08:03:04 internet in <propfemale> sucks! is it too much to ask that the internet doesn't crash every 5 minutes? i swear i'm gonna go crazy before the summer is over at this rate.

2010-11-25 16:25:40 i'm thankful that everyone i care about is healthy and happy. have a happy thanksgiving everyone.
2010-06-18 18:59:06 "all i have to say is, if we get on the wrong plane, well yes it'd be my fault but you should've e playful ected as much. i have practically no idea what i'm doing..."
2010-06-26 22:13:04 went to bed feeling like crap. woke up just now feeling crappier... figures
2010-09-30 01:46:58 "having a heart-to-heart talk with your parents is a little awkward at first, but after a while, it's almost like talking to your friends. and the end result is always satisfying."
2010-06-27 04:52:16 "ugh. it's not bad enough i have to taste my partly digested food when i throw up, but does it have to come out through my nose as well? that's just nasty..."
2010-08-21 02:31:18 "whenever i take a break from facebook, i always seem to come back right on time to wish someone a happy birthday... how do i do that?"
2010-12-15 01:03:31 "the bad thing about being a part of more than 1 club/activity/group/whatever is that there comes a time when you have to choose one over the other. and then you're conflicted because both groups feel they're more important than the other. and you feel guilty because no matter what you choose, you know someone's not entirely happy."
2011-01-21 16:04:23 "english 2 cas: to those who do not know or are doubtful, our mystery story is indeed our english final for the semester. mrs. <propmale> has confirmed it. pass this on (not necessarily copy and paste; you can just tell them over the phone or something) if you can in case someone won't see this in time, especially <propfirst> (m), <propfirst> (d), <propmale>, and <propmale>, because i don't have them as friends on facebook."
2010-08-12 13:07:08 to whoever's in charge of bad luck: tomorrow's friday the 13th. let's see if you can create enough bad luck to ruin my birthday.
2010-08-07 04:11:30 why is it that my dad's iphone doesn't need a proxy to get on facebook?
2011-01-07 23:32:06 first time cooking dinner in 9 months. still as fun as always  joyful 
2010-11-24 22:06:29 "today was nice. did practically no work the entire day (save for two classes, ceramics and tech)."
2010-10-08 02:12:00 loving the new opening and ending of yu-gi-oh 5d's!!!
2010-09-13 01:09:01 these reading questions are a lot harder than they looked on friday...
2010-10-14 17:38:18 has officially found his first teacher/school staff that he hates.
2010-12-06 23:42:14 "if i may say so myself, awesome <propfemale> festival today!"
2010-12-23 18:15:24 "until today, i did not realize the song ""alone again"" was in both <propmale> little 2 and ice age 3"
2010-09-25 18:39:14 i still can't tell the difference between interests and activities...
2010-11-02 23:15:24 i wish we had math homework that didn't involve drawing graphs every other problem...
2010-09-07 00:45:37 "finally learned how to use sine, cosine, and tangent. thanks mom... and thanks to you too calculator..."

2010-10-10 17:05:28 now why couldn't the weather have been this nice during the weekday?
2010-09-26 20:03:47 finished reading a separate peace... still don't know why it's called a separate peace...
2010-10-13 03:02:00 "section 4, problem 31: the answer on the back is incorrect... it should be 2019, not 2017. where do i go to complain?"
2010-09-15 23:15:38 "reasons to go to mcg (from lowest priority to highest priority):1. get creativity hours2. fun classes3. <propfemale> out with friends4. long bus rides5. on the day of the signup, eat 4 pizzas before you even get to dinner  laugh "
2010-09-15 02:19:09 "what i learned today from chemistry: if you do not have an ice tray, you waste a lot of oil..."
2010-10-08 21:13:58 how did we meet? (copy this to your status and see who remembers)
2010-10-15 23:17:24 for those going to homecoming: hope you have fun. for those that aren't: go ahead and chat with me tonight if you want. i'll be keeping facebook open while i work on my history notes.
2010-10-23 20:30:36 self-discipline sucks sometimes...
2010-11-30 23:36:35 "i sometimes wonder why i'm such a loyal, committed idiot... unlike my smarter friends, who decided to go home and finish the english essay, i went to stage crew, even though i don't even have 1 <propfemale> done yet... looks like another sleepless night..."
2010-09-28 01:30:59 reading stuff on <propfirst> for english homework. i do not sound like a <propfirst>. at all.
2010-11-05 00:49:17 "like my status and i'll tell you...1. something i've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds.2. the color you remind me of3. my first memory of you...4. the animal you remind me of......5. ask something i've always wondered about you 6. my favorite thing about you7. challenge you to post this"
2010-10-25 10:34:44 this is why you shouldn't put stuff off until the last minute. lesson learned... for the 4982nd time...
2010-10-07 01:50:49 sweet! found out i could use google documents to type out my essay...
2011-01-03 01:12:00 i remember back when winter break seemed like an eternity. now it just passes in the blink of an eye...
2010-12-04 16:17:42 sweet. microsoft office 2007 already has the exact format for the outline
2010-10-23 14:10:14 mr. naveh makes finding a why question sound easier than it really is...
2010-11-01 20:50:51 had forgotten what it was like to <propfemale> a 50lb bag of rice...
2010-12-18 02:55:34 "the first day of one acts was a success if i do say so myself. thanks to everyone who came. for those who didn't, hope you come tomorrow."
2011-01-21 11:22:59 figures we'd only have a 2 hour delay -_-
2010-11-30 05:08:10 "crap!! fell asleep when i came home, woke up around now, meaning i missed the deadline for the tech homework. and i didn't even need to stay up that late over the weekend since the history notes weren't due until friday. yeah, i hate my life right now..."
2011-01-23 02:44:25 "20% of my semester grade and all i have to do is write a story, no essay. best english final ever..."
2011-01-21 12:36:26 never mind. spoke too soon
2010-12-12 03:27:34 is jealous of all the people who have christmas trees ='(
2011-01-12 20:14:59 cooking lunch: fun. washing dishes: not fun. just another drawback of having no school...
2011-01-22 00:48:30 "i swear my sister hates doing dishes. she gets me to do them almost every <propmale> she has, even though we had an agreement that i would cook food and she would wash dishes..."
2011-01-28 04:17:31 holy crap. i had 3 cuts on my foot and i didn't even notice until practically the entire bottom of the foot was covered in blood...
2011-01-12 13:00:00 the good news: no school. the bad news: i'm gonna be bored out of my mind...
2011-01-24 04:11:03 who knew the school delayed for really cold temperatures too... but i'm not complaining. no music class again  smile
