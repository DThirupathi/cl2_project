"is it just me, or did this week start out horribly?"
"school. it's always there. me... i was there, then i wasn't.... no seriously. i was. ""was."""
time to chill? i think so...
"""and know that if i, knew all the answers i would not hold them from you'd know all of the things that i know. we told eachother, there is no other way."""
"hiding from the enemy is hard. hiding in plain sight is easy. becoming invisible however, only belongs to those who hold secrecy."
i think i'm allowed to wish everyone an official <propfemale> christmas now!
"""a writer writes his mind, not his ideas."" - anonymous"
no! i watch you and you don't watch me!
just want to wish everyone a happy holiday!~
"""it's okay. we will be there. besides, there's not only negative feelings inside people. courage... everyone has the courage... here."""
"""where does this go?"""
as of today... there shall be no more love for anyone.
i'm never going to get work done after this all starts....
"""so if i ever see you on the street / ill pretend that i didnt see / and turn my face / no use in small talk anyways"""
why am i up? why else? it's story time. just... not for you people.
i believe the obsession has finally hit... thank you for a totally free weekend.
meh... fun but it could have been better...

"for those who felt it, 5.7 in socal. south of palm springs."
