i have never been more annoyed with an anime in my life! why does the main character have to be so bloody stupid? > surprise 
oh the nostalgia... klonoa you're so awesome!
i need to play klonoa so badly right now... why is my ps2 not connected? why has <propfemale> got the wii remake? gah! d:
maybe listening to the klonoa soundtrack isn't helping the situation.
finally got to play klonoa 2. i still get freaked out when klonoa is close/going to fall - i also still freak out on that level where that boss chases. i also ramble (a lot) about the weirdest things; but i can't seem to hold a normal conversation.  laugh 
"everything is falling, what? why?"
morning!
saw a lovely parrot.
what's up?
morning again!
"morning, yet again people! the holiday is going so fast.  sad "
oh what a laugh maaaan-face!
i'm surprised no one has complained about my laughing. o.o
night everyone!
mornin'!
"i want to hear more of it. next time, i hope."
why do i have a twitter?
what a day.
"haha, procrastination station in the nation! yeah..."
needs a freakin' hair cut.  laugh 
what's on your mind?
crys-t! i'm loling so much right now!
"spleen, it remembers..."
"i think, and this is just a 'wild' guesstimation, i have developed a fully fledged cold."
"awesome day today. <propmale>, you ledge!"
"oh dear, looks like that smothered chicken in the sandpiper today, or rather yesterday, was not a good idea. either that or i'm actually coming down with something.  sad happy birthday mum!  annoyed "
"yeah, i'm ill. proper. i'm really unlucky health wise this year."
oh how i wish it was a friday. then if i'm still like this tomorrow i wouldn't be missing anything. but it's not so... crap.
i feel like i'm gonna be sick. waaah!  sad 
dyscalculia? i really do think so. 4+4 laugh !  playful 
'simply knowing you exist ain't good enough for me...'
"happy birthday mother! even if you can't see this, happy birthday anyway! thanks for never forgetting to be awesome.  laugh "
feeling sick isn't nice. stay away from me food! eww... what?
"just told mum, it feels like a weight off my shoulders.  laugh "
make the nausea go away. please?
"so, i'd like to eat, i really would. the sight of food makes me want to puke... it's not nice."
ugh...
"just had a grey ladybird on my desk. t'was pretty cute. it was just walking along, not a care in the world. highlight of my day, how sad. well, i am stuck at home so it makes sense right? it's not everyday a person gets to see a grey ladybird inside, right?  smile "
"just read bits and pieces from my journal to the parents, i think i may have baffled them with some of the things i wrote. though i'm not entirely sure. ah well."
"so i'm still ill. however, today is the 3rd of march, which is reason enough to be happy! wooh, 3rd of march!!!"
"why couldn't i just be identifiably allergic to one type of 'consumable' product; that would be easier dealt with than the, more or less, unknown!"
i can put monsters under my bed.  wink 
can't believe i got the amnesia story right on emmerdale on the very first episode <propfirst> got hurt. i now predict that only his first wifey will be able to get his memory back.
"i'm currently obsessed with pieces of flair, the gems they have on there. it's a shame more people don't use it... *hint*"
i feel like a zombie... or something.
i'm looking forward to next weekend!
nothing is on my mind at the moment.
"head ache, yay!"
"yay, i have my computer back! lovin' the fastness of it!"
"i'm not feeling to great... i want to be able to eat food, but the thought is also making me feel worse."
i'm ill again...  sad

i feel like i should still be at college... lol. so awesome that i've done pretty much everything for this wbac thingy.  playful 
i know what i am going to be using artemis for; it was hard to decide exactly but what i have in mind is going to be very fitting and hopefully - in the long run - beneficial.
"why are you broken pieces of flair? i wants to see ""my creations"" and stuff. d:"
tired of thinking to much... tired from thinking too much...

"dw rocked today, am so glad that the new doctor was not made of fail!"
"don't make me go back to college tomorrow, i don't want to have to sit through welsh bac and the like. i'd rather waste my time at home on the tinterwebs. d:"
"i don't like the new fb profile. why is the status box hidden? now you have to click on ""status"". guess it's got something to do with fb wanting us to ""put more effort in"" rather than making things easier... *is really close to leaving*"
"nothin' like stickin' all your songs on reeaaally loud and singin' along, really takes the pressure off thinking."
achy headache is achy...  annoyed 
"just had a packet of m&m's, they so cannot be beaten."
"seriously, no one says ""gee whizz"" any more, so stop saying it you stupid man!"
"i'm half asleep here, feel like a zombie or sommit. lol"
"finally connected mother's laptop to the internet. 'twas not easy for she has ubuntu, a foreign, and slightly user unfriendly operating system. o.o"

"ipod touch came today, it's really pretty snazzy!"
"it's strange to think that a couple of months ago i couldn't whistle at all and now i'm whistling along to songs and stuff. yeah, still not brilliant but i'd never thought i'd be able to whistle ever, let alone whistle a tune."
"every now and again i remember i am turning 18 this year, then freak out because it means ""becoming an adult"", i'm still a really childish person and so the concept freaks me out! i blame <propfemale>'s birthday for reminding me."
doctor who = awesome
i have a funny feeling i may have mild hay fever - randomly.
"college tomorrow, if i can make it. i hope this year i'm luckier health wise. if i can't go tomorrow i've already notified the teachers so they can give me work and stuff, so no worries. -_-"

"<propfirst> green answered another of my questions! it's not that he is answering them that's the most interesting part. out of all the people asking questions of all kinds, mine were deemed interesting enough to answer.  laugh "
why is youtube being so slow? all i want to do is take a break from revision...  sad 
college tomorrow!
"mini unicorns that pee rainbows, they are just the right size for the fairies to ride - fabulous."

"damn... sad dream, not only that but it also woke me up. it took ages to get to sleep and now i'm awake again, awesome."
"yay, my facebook font size is bigger. thank you ""better facebook""!"
head... still... bad.... d:
"my birthday is totally froody, in the <propfemale>! adulthood, tango you!"
"anyone else have a love/hate 'relationship' with urban dictionary? sometimes it hits the nail on the head when it comes to slang, other times it's stupid and insulting. -_-"
"bb's <propfirst> pepper constantly being called ""<propfirst> pepper"" or just ""(the) pepper"" reminds me of the days when people used to call me ""<propfirst> perrin"" or just ""perrin-oh"". seriously people, why?  annoyed "

tatty bye my lovelies...  laugh 
today has been awful...
"it's <propfemale>'s fault that i like anime, btw."
it's a kind of magic that i can see right through you; it's like you're an invisible man riding a bicycle. i'm certainly not gonna stop you now! what?
"can't believe it's almost christmas already, where does the time go?"
"my head, it hurts...  sad "
