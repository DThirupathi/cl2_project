2010-09-11 04:33:45 "love is...a temporary madness.  it erupts like an eathquake and then subsides. and when it subsides you need to make a decision. you have to work out if your roots have become entwined together, if that is the case it is inconcievable that you should ever part.because this is what love is."
2010-09-26 21:23:57 "we are thinking of them as who that have been in the past, rather than allowing mental space in our minds, for who they might actually be.as long as one holds a mental image of his partner and someone he is not happy with, she will continue to show up in his eyes that way."
2010-09-11 04:34:09 "love is not breathlessness. it is not excitement it is not the premulgation of promises of eternal passion.that is just being ""in love"" which any of us can convince ourselves we are.love itself is what is left over when being ""in love"" has all burned away, and this is both an <propmale> and a fortunate accident."

2010-09-26 20:49:21 "at the same time with the equality of modern woman, he must have a very cautious and open mind, with usage of words so that one does not end up branded sexist.the values of an old society when it comes to being a real man are great but must now be blended into a society where we as genders are both equals."
2010-10-06 13:52:37 "had an amazing day yesterday, cementing the 6th of october in my mind and a day to always be remembered and treasured for all my life."

2010-09-26 22:25:24 "thoughts from the topic ""anger management"" in my book ""a modern <propmale> man""how is anger related to depression?often ones anger becomes ones depression, when we give up fighting a problem, in doing so  one loses the energy of anger, thus becoming depressed, mildly to start with and if left unchecked will develop into deep clinical depression, often needed professional help to get one through."
2010-09-26 21:20:56 "thoughts from the topic ""laws of attraction""men if you are in a unhappy ""dissatisfying"" relationship now, stop ""pigeon-holing"" your partner. its a clearly know fact that when we are not happy in our current relationship, we often place our partners in a labelled box, sometimes consciously, most times sub-consciously without realizing it."

2010-09-26 21:27:19 "men, you must give your partner room to be who she is capable of being , by consciously entertaining higher thoughts or e playful ectations of her.give her the right to live up to or down to your e playful ectations.only in this way can she become someone in your eyes that you understand and can move forward with into a stronger loving relationship."
