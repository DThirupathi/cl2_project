2010-07-09 01:49:22 """you can kill my body, but you can't kill my soul. my soul will live forever!"""
2010-06-19 00:50:22 "so call the mainland, from the beach,your heart is now washed up in bleach,the waves are rising for this time of year.and nobody knows what to do with heat,under sunshine pylons, we'll meet,while rain is falling, like rhinestones from the sky."
2010-05-03 22:49:08 hmm... i agree with the tacos
2010-09-27 00:52:38 we'll be just fine...
2010-08-26 21:46:06 "all i have to say is that some people are just freaking stupid. they get angry over stupid, petty things. then they just do stupid stuff."
2010-10-05 21:08:07 "so, whatever this is, this thing that now i've becomeyou hate it so much, you keep on running from it"
2010-05-04 02:29:27 the tacos lied after all
2010-08-29 14:58:41 "what about sunrisewhat about rainwhat about all the thingsthat you said we were to gain...what about killing fieldsis there a timewhat about all the thingsthat you said was yours and mine...did you ever stop to noticeall the blood we've shed beforedid you ever stop to noticethe crying earth the weeping shores?"

2010-09-04 22:10:01 "everytime one of my parents yells for me, i'm afraid that they're going to punish me for something i've done. fml"
2010-12-05 04:05:50 i wanna be praised from a new perspective
2010-11-10 21:41:09 "life lives, life dies.life laughs, life cries.life gives up and life tries.but life looks differentthrough everyone's eyes."

2010-05-20 22:14:58 "my brother just murdered an innocent life. all it wanted to do was live, prosper, and pass of it's traits through it's offsrping in order to continue the legacy of life..."
2010-06-30 01:07:57 "so, who wants to come see the last airbender with me thursday? any takers?"

2010-06-01 03:02:06 is pissed off
2010-05-24 21:39:13 "leaving school early would have been alright today, except the ub meeting was terrible. i walk in and then i'm told to sit from the dark by five somber voices, all speaking in unison. the chair i sat in was directly below a single hanging lightbulb, slowly swinging. a glass of water was already set in front of me, but a fly was slowly creeping along the rim of the glass."
2010-09-01 01:51:11 "to all the people that told me happy birthday today, thank you. this birthday hasn't been the best so far, but it definitely hasn't been the worst  laugh "
2010-05-26 04:16:10 tomorrow is going to be fun  laugh 
2010-05-06 01:17:04 feels like screaming-you know just for the fun of it.
2010-06-22 00:59:41 it's a distraction!
2010-05-22 15:16:31 "so when i go to upward bound this summer, i have to take part in a talent show. so i'm going to play one of my favorite songs on marimba. someone take a guess at what i'm going to play!!!"
2010-05-20 01:58:13 "i feel like crawling under a bed and laying there for while, and i feel like shit."
2010-06-11 13:15:58 only my dad has the ability to immediately ruin my first day out of school.
2010-05-25 01:07:24 thinks it's time for a haircut. and wishes people would actually tell him how long something is going to take.
2010-05-19 00:13:53 "honestly, i hope it gives you hell."
2010-05-09 13:59:40 i'm going to cook a meal for my mom cause it's mother's day. this isn't going to be easy.
2010-05-22 00:43:55 <propfemale> varney owes me some very delicious brownies.

2010-06-15 00:04:33 """getting out"" by every avenue-the story of my life. maybe that's not up to me to decide,so maybe it is, maybe it isn't. but if it is then my life lasts 4 minutes and 13 seconds."
2010-06-15 01:07:25 "se <propfemale> de todos ustedes, y hablando en espaÃ±ol es divertido!"
2010-07-14 16:25:03 "had some awesome hours with <propfirst> camper and zak <propfirst> yesterday. and, i got my glasses today. so, now i can see, which is awesome."
2010-06-08 02:11:22 "i may be glad that i have a bright summer ahead of me, in the next school year i'll miss many people. i hope that they will all remember me, and visit sometime."

2010-06-15 23:54:45 "is bored!!!! if i don't find something to do, i'm going to end up sleeping. all the time."
2010-09-02 01:33:47 "through electric lines i see a sky,tarnished by a puff of smoke,to a mere hazy gray.so i say the judges,it's not a lie,just the stark cold truth."
2010-06-19 04:30:53 "if it's not going to happen, why do i keep waiting?"
2010-07-04 03:49:52 "all hail <propmale> neptune and his water breathers,no snail thing too quick for his water feeders.don't waste time with your net, our net worth is set, ready, go."

2010-06-25 00:14:33 twilight is completely overrated. i just don't see why it's so popular.
2010-11-03 21:40:46 "indivisible, or invisible?"

2010-07-20 16:11:00 "my dad is still a jerk, but i did get my school schedule. the only problem is i need to change it, i just don't know what to drop."
2010-08-05 21:45:06 nothing. i'm in the type of mood where nothing brings me satisfaction.
2010-09-22 01:27:26 one excuse can answer everything.
2010-07-05 03:53:25 all of us failed to match our dreams of perfection. so i rate us on the basis of our splendid failure to do the impossible.
2010-07-10 23:32:03 """every calling is great when greatly pursued."""
2010-09-13 00:56:51 has anyone ever had a state of being that they just can't e playful lain at all? because that is exactly how i feel.

2010-09-02 23:02:33 "can't wait for his weekend. <propfirst> shaw , <propfirst> camper , and i must have many laughs and a good time."
2010-08-25 00:55:52 "how can we be sure of everything. actually, we can't be sure of anything. just think about anything and everything. you can never know the answer to anything. everything is nothing. nothing is anything."
2010-09-20 23:25:54 i don't even know!
2010-09-06 19:48:17 it is to hard to do anything.
2010-09-25 11:55:38 we <propfemale> and well fell... but at least we tried to do it together.
2010-09-12 00:17:55 "trying is getting pretty hard, but it's what gives meaning to anything."
2010-08-22 03:11:00 i need something. but that's not my problem.
2010-09-17 20:38:54 i can't talk.
2011-02-14 22:22:57 "<propfirst> camper and <propfirst> shaw, call 536-4942. do it!"
2010-10-06 21:43:59 cannot wait until he finishes pre-calculas.
2010-09-15 11:07:20 i cannot accurately describe my dislike for chemistry and pre-calculas.
2010-08-27 21:44:57 i love how people cling to what they know when confronted with difference and discomfort. and for all their answers to life.
2010-09-27 01:41:14 like this status and iâ€™ll describe you in 1 word on your wall.
2010-09-17 10:12:12 "they keep telling me, ""it's not like it seems."""
2010-09-27 22:33:34 winds over <propfemale>
2010-10-30 03:28:28 "time hurries on and the leaves that are green turn to brown and they wither in the wind and they crumble in your hand"
2010-09-19 22:51:26 "sometimes, certain people just need a backhand to make them realize that they're freaking insane."
2010-10-15 17:20:39 try to live your life as though your every action could suddenly become a universal law.
2010-10-08 23:21:04 "but my words like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence"
2010-10-17 11:47:58 i still have not started my take-home test for anatomy. it's gonna suck if i actually fail this test....
2010-10-12 23:16:43 really wants to be unstoppable.
2010-12-09 22:13:49 "stop, rewind, burn the tape."
2010-10-21 20:56:01 the sound of silence
2011-02-18 04:00:12 "if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate."
2011-02-21 05:02:36 "today the horoscope i read was completely right about how i spent my day. the only problem is... i'm a virgo, not a capricorn..."
2011-02-28 23:27:38 "holy crap, me and <propfirst> silvers are totally getting morphsuits."
2011-03-03 00:20:20 we're fated to pretend.
2011-03-08 03:57:01 "we're nothing but a flash in space, gone before we're understood."
2011-03-10 02:06:19 i wish they could see how it's killing me.
2011-03-11 19:28:58 good thing i brought my shotun-cane.
2011-03-13 16:42:40 "i learned two things today. first, if you think about power rangers while manually changing channels on your tv, you will black out. second, mailboxes are dangerous."
2011-03-16 00:21:37 emit remmus. just found out what it is.
2011-03-16 01:15:03 as heads or tails.
2011-03-17 23:53:18 "dear mother, kudos on the enchiladas"
2011-03-23 21:17:23 "building your lensesdigging your trenchesput me on the front linesleave me with a dumb mind"
2011-03-24 20:41:23 "blah blah blah. my face is ugly. sometimes, when no one is looking, i lick the spaces between my toes. at night i cry because i haven't seen the latest twilight movie, and one day i want to grow up to be just like <propfemale>......"
2011-03-26 23:46:33 "i'll say i'm not going to sit and wait, but that's exactly what i'll do."
2011-03-27 22:31:42 "<propmale> <propmale> poe, i just interpreted your story. what now?!"
2011-04-03 23:04:00 just what exactly is the fucking point?
