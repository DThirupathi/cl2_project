2011-08-19 11:03:59 "special request to all kids returning to school in the next few weeks  if you see someone who is struggling to make friends or being bullied because they don't have many friends or because they are shy or not as pretty or not dressed in the most ""in"" clothes, please step up  say hi or at least smile at them in the hallway  you never know what that person might be facing outside of school  your kindness might just make a big difference in someone's life!! ~ help stop the bullying by re-posting"
2011-09-08 19:13:10 "rather fed up with these ""cancer awareness facebook statuses""  why? cause they do nothing to raise awareness  the ugly face of cancer isn't some joke about bras or make people think you're pregnant- it's the loss of loved ones, uncertainty, and destruction of your body in chemo  want to help? go and offer to drive someone to chemo, have a chat to someone you know who's suffering next time or just donate a quid to mcmillan  this is raising awareness!"
