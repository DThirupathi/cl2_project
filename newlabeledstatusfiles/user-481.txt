2010-12-05 18:03:49 "changeyour profile pic to a photo of bono if you want to stop poverty, cureaids, solve world hunger, save the environment and establish worldpeace. copy and paste this to your status so together we can save theworld (by changing our profile pictures on a social networking site)."
