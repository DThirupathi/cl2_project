2009-08-29 22:48:14 "it will be hot for the next few days, but it looks like we should be getting a denser cloud of percipitation coming over san <propmale> soon which should help cool things down a few degrees. but don't hold me to it i'm not an actually meterologist so my interpertation of the satalite imagery might be off a little."
2009-08-26 06:42:35 "thinks that sleep is a good idea and who ever invented sleep deserves a cookie. a big cookie. with chocolate chips. fresh from the oven. back to my point, sleep = good."
2009-09-08 23:44:23 first day of school = tired + scared for when real work comes.
2009-07-28 07:03:47 "is amazing of course, and the apples to apples champion."

2009-09-21 03:12:38 is praying for a phone call from the doctors saying the neurologist accepted his referal and will see him soon.
2009-09-24 23:43:47 was at uc yesterday and apologizes if he seemed a little out of it today. they gave him another pain shot.
2009-09-26 23:03:28 "just spent a half hour ductaping a tin can only to through it out. then spent about an hour playing with ductape, and made pouch that he will never use. <propfirst> feels really cool right now.  smile "

2009-09-25 05:39:40 has decided that the laws of physics must not apply to his project. one side takes 21.59 seconds to drain water to the other side. the other side takes fron 58.9 seconds to 80.4 seconds to empty. the same results happen over and over with no e playful lanation
2009-10-03 04:02:25 """just because i know everything doesn't mean i'll be telling you anything true."""
2009-08-25 00:10:00 's mind has decided to check out for a while. it left a note saying it should be back around 11 am tomorrow.

2009-11-01 22:17:23 just washed a paper plate so that he could use it for something else. it would have been easier to just grab a new one right next to him.
2009-10-27 05:32:28 "has probably, most likely, lost what ever symbolance of a mind he once held."
