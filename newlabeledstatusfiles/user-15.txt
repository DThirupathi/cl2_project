2011-01-05 18:18:55 "1 corinthians 6:19-20 do you not know that your bodies are temples of the holy spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from god? you are not your own; you were bought at a price. therefore honor god with your bodies."
2010-01-02 18:41:25 "1 corinthians 10:13no temptation has seized you except what is common to man. and god is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. but when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it."
2010-11-02 21:39:17 i neep a nap
2010-10-29 16:50:50 it's hard to be strong for the people you love when you feel weak yourself. i suppose that's where god comes in.
2010-09-26 05:29:08 spent over an hour scrubbin our bathtub and now it freakin sparkles. take that soap scum!!
2011-01-08 23:33:37 "<propfirst> 1:19-20my dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that god desires."
2010-09-28 14:09:24 "thanks to my sister, im now addicted the the house of night series. started book one on sunday afternoon, and am now 50 pages into book two. coming from someone who doesn't read a lot, that's pretty amazing  smile "

2010-10-11 15:27:41 a swollen finger with a sore joint? what does this mean?
2010-11-07 01:18:51 "i never used to believe in the saying ""live for today"". but i realized that if you always live for the future, you are going to look back on life and see that you never really lived at all. it's great to set goals, but if working to achieve those goals takes away daily joy, then perhaps your goals are not worth reaching. (speaking to myself)"
2010-11-15 16:40:11 im going to conquer this week one day at a time. challenger #1: monday.
2010-11-30 16:26:15 so.. i pretty much stubbed my little toe on the couch. it's insanely purple.

2010-11-22 04:18:17 "i want to be excited about the snow. but the more it snows, the tougher my job is  sad  conflicted much? i think so."
2010-12-15 06:57:29 "â€œcourage doesn't always roar. sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ""i will try again tomorrow.â€�"
2010-01-01 17:55:11 "<propmale> 29:11""for i know the plans i have for you,"" says the lord. ""they are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope."
2011-01-20 16:08:51 """a peacefulness follows any decision, even the wrong one."""

2010-12-28 16:55:37 no sleep last night. sometimes i wish i could shut my mind off.
2011-01-04 20:45:20 "1 <propfirst> 5:7 cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you."
