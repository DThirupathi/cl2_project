2011-01-31 23:12:37 "there are so many opprotunities these days that we sometimes don't even pay attention to whats right infront of us or it's just something we never thought that  would happen. well, i got one that i can take a risk and show them what im capable of doing. this is where i fight for what i <propfemale>. this is where i need support and encouragement the most. this is a once in a lifetime <propmale> to make my dream into my life."

2011-02-27 22:55:41 if you judge a book by its cover you'll never understand or know what their story is about. until you finally focus and read front to back without skipping any pages it won't make sense. whether you read it or not you are part of their story. the question is do you just want to be in it or help them continue writing it?
2011-02-28 04:30:56 "even though your gone the memory i have of you will never fade.. love "
