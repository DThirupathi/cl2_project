"whenever something is gained, something is always lost.it's difficult to live after something like that.            what is lost will never return. important things, irreplaceable things, but what is needed to keep those things is in the firm will packed into one bullet. man knows, he knows nothing will begin unless he speaks, and that nothing will change, unless he moves.sigh.."

"in times of hardships, in times of sadness, there's a place a traveler can let his mind return to: home. i still don't know what kind of a past the traveler abandoned when he left his home behind. i still don't know what kind of sorrow he bears. but the traveler can keep walking forward because he has something which sustains him...a place which accepts him. he can walk forward, step, by careful step."
