2011-02-16 03:29:03 "i wish our uniforms were warmer ._. i'm freezing my ass off. they tell me that i'm going to be up and out on the field at 6 am until '??' since i'm on night watch again until 11 (they're letting me sleep tonight!), maybe yuna fayth suzuki could give me a call and let me talk to the kids and her...?"
2011-02-16 04:57:50 "going to sleep in 3 minutes!! i want sleep sooooo badly. though, it was really nice talking to yuna fayth suzuki, lennon and <propfemale>. see you guys the 3rd!!"

2011-02-17 03:02:57 "okay, seriously now.three more guys were killed today; two more injured. i've been out on the field all day fighting and i'm tired as hell. and they tell me that friday-sunday i'm doing re-con and leading an invasion. please, try not to worry anymore, yuna fayth suzuki, but that means no calling/texting or anything with me this weekend."
2011-02-17 16:52:41 "well, last night i gave a certain girl a surprise visit. i thought that since i won't be able to talk with her this weekend i might as well come visit. had a very fun night with yuna fayth suzuki. i took the longest shower when i got up  love  it feels great to be home."
2011-02-21 03:24:42 "the invasion was a complete success; in fact, it was so successful that i'm coming home thursday. that's right, i'm coming home the 24th!! can't wait to be able to sleep well, eat good food and be awakened by kids jumping on my bed. i'll be home 8 days earlier, good news, yuna fayth suzuki?"
