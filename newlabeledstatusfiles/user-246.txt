2011-05-15 23:53:26 don't listen to anyone when they advise you on solutions regarding morals because they rely on the indicators that are of the illusionary perfect world  decide for yourself what you feel is best whether it seems moral or immoral and you will be a more satisfied individual

2011-06-27 05:11:38 i was always told that nothing is easy about this life  i learned the hardest trials will always have to do with people 
2011-07-12 08:20:36 "damn, i actually miss the old days when i could go on the street and spar with someone, on these streets, if we spar someone has to die its the reality"
2011-07-26 19:05:13 "everyone deserves happiness, but to get it you have to allow it come into your life "
2011-08-02 19:25:21 "everyday i wake, all i see is the shine of rhe coming through my window, it reflects the greatness, humility, and power of the almighty  even if i dont follow a religion, i still stand for god, allah, the supreme deity with many names  the power is in me to believe and there i strive on this thing ppl call luck but it's not, it's god giving me and all those around me the blessing of spiritual awareness "

2011-08-09 02:55:29 trance is crack for logical while dubstep is weed for the methodical
2011-08-16 07:27:39 "nearby is the truth, but nearer are the lies  so my grandma would say ""you have no friends"" my response at that time would be silence but now my response would be ""i am blessed to not be surrounded by stupidity of crowds but by the few that serve their purpose"" i appreciate the intelligence of my friends for they know themselves"

2011-08-26 04:53:44 "i really want to understand why people keep asking questions they have no foundation to even start to answer themselves  if you dont understand why your life may seemily feel bad then look to your friends and ask them about their lives and you will find out it is equally bad and good at times  no one has a bad life 100% of the time, unless they want it to be that way "
