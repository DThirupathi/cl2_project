they say true friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship. these friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday regardless of how long it has been or how far they live and they don't hold grudges. they understand life is busy but you will always love them. re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends. i am privileged to say that i do!
"due to unavoidable personal circumstances a friend of mine needs to re-home their dog.<propmale> is a 2 year old black and white border collie - he has been neutered, is house trained and very well behaved, although he is also 'mad as a box of frogs'! he is a really lovely chap who's used to children (although he can be bit boisterous) he has grown up with cats but still chases them!"
