being sick isn't much fun at all...  annoyed 
"...i got more on my mind than i ever told, i got pain that you never felt. i got the scars, i can deal with it on my own. i've got stories that i'll never tell, but maybe it's just as well. cause you don't know me, you don't wanna know it's real, and i'm not sorry for who i am for what i feel, cause you don't know me..."

"is thinking ""ice cream and cake and cake. ice cream and cake and cake. ice cream and cake to the ice cream and cake. ice cream and cake to the ice cream and cake..."" all thanks to <propfemale> <propfemale>"
"so many things that i should say if it even mattered anyway. the war has long been lost to sad souls that can't count the cost. but love is just an open flame, we burn ourselves just to feel the pain, no. when is it over now?"
"if god had a name, what would it be, and would you call it to his face. if you were faced with him in all his glory,what would you ask if you had just one question... what if god was one of us, just a slob like one of us, just a stranger on the bus,trying to make his way home..."
"...take me, this is all that i've got, this is all that i'm not, all that i'll ever be. i've got flaws, i've got faults keep searching for your heart. it doesn't matter who you are, we all have our scars..."
"...run fast for your mother; run fast for your father.run for your children all your sisters and brothers. leave all your love and your longing behind. you can't <propfemale> it with you if you want to survive.the dog days are over,the dog days are done.can you hear the horses,'cos here they come...."
"when you sit and find old cards and memories...sometimes you can't help but think about what you had, miss the people you <propmale> out with, and the pain you once felt then wonder why people change and if it is your fault that everything is different..."
"...is there anybody out there? am i swimming through this empty sea alone? am i looking for an answer? or am i trying to find a way to get back home? is there anybody out there? would you hear me if i screamed or if i cried? i am looking for an answer, and just trying to find a way to survive..."
"i'm a paint brush in a way. i'm simple, yeah, i'm plain. i'm colored all the same. i have meaning if you find it in yourself..."
"forgiving does not erase the bitter past. a healed memory is not a deleted memory. instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. we change the memory of our past into a hope for our future. -<propfirst> b. smede"
"cause when you die, well you die, so just live how you please because we are all alive and we're free. let not anyone claim forward thought paves mistakes cause they dressed us then left us alone..."
"...you've got to make a choice, if the music drowns you out, and raise your voice every single time they try and shut your mouth. sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls, every time that you lose it sing it for the world. sing it from the heart, sing it till you're nuts, sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts. sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind, sing about everyone that you left behind..."
"this world is like a trampoline, high and low no in between. jumping at the <propmale> to please everyone but thats not me..."
sleep with one ear close to the ground and wake up screaming. when we lay our cold weapons down we'll wake up dreaming...
<propfemale>  smile 
"dear chemistry,  once upon a time you were my favorite subject and i understood you.  now i still understand you, but i absolutely loathe you right now...."
"who are you to tell me that i'm less than what i should be? who are you? who are you? i don't need to listen to the list of things i should do. i won't try, no i won't try."
