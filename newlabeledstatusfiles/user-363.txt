2010-01-06 02:21:43 "i need to forget all the empty promises you said to me. hearts were only meant to bleed. when we planted that first seed of hope, we never thought it would come to this. yet here i am and there you are"
2010-01-08 21:14:44 "thinking thoughts about thoughts i thought, if i think of these thoughts right, i think i'd be the thinking genius that thought too much about thinking."

2010-01-05 03:45:22 don't tell me you're sorry because you're not...whatever happened to dancing in the rain? to loving despite the pain? is there nothing in this world to gain?
2009-01-02 06:35:34 "sick of trying, tired of crying, yeah im smiling, but inside im dying"
2010-02-04 22:09:23 hollow words and empty promises only amount to so much. they last but a mere second in this spiraling world we call home. so then why do we still cling to them with so much hope?

2010-02-24 00:12:35 "...it's ironic how we ignore those who adore us, adore those who ignore us, hurt those who love us, and love those who hurt us."
2010-03-04 22:42:20 "have you ever had one of those moments where you just want to hit someone or something, but you know you'll get in trouble and then, your english teacher gives you a metal pole? i love those moments...."
