2010-01-11 03:22:03 why is the world so unfair? why are people living on the streets while others are living in million dollar houses? why are people blessed with beauty and others need to hide themselves? why are people less fortunate than us looked down upon? how did this all come to be?

2010-03-02 06:50:42 "he comes from the grave, his body a home of worms and filth. no life in his eyes, no warmth of his skin, no beating of his breast. his soul, as empty and dark as the night sky. he laughs at the blade, spits at the arrow, for they will not harm his flesh. for eternity, he will walk the earth, smelling the sweet blood if the living, feasting upon the bones of the damned. beware, for he is the living dead."
2009-11-23 03:34:22 i hate having my birthday so close to thanksgiving. it takes all the fun out of both of them.
2010-02-28 23:03:17 "i feel putridly sick, the vile taste of a failed immune system rising in the back of my throat. every time i breathe, my body trembles in agony, my muscles cry out for relief, my mind floods with warning signals of death. yet i press on, this hell not deterring me from my passions and my prayers."
2009-12-17 23:57:58 "live life to its fullest, just be careful what you fill it with."
2009-12-13 06:34:06 the worst insults come when we don't even mean it.
2010-03-12 06:46:52 "words. the greatest thing about them is that they will never cease to exist. they start in the mind, and always stay there, even when spoken. words, the core of communication, allow humans to process, reason, and form thoughts. without them, mankind would die. they exhibit emotion, and occasionally are used in a way they weren't meant for."
2010-03-17 06:18:23 "are we mere machines? do we walk and talk about as if we are mindless creatures, preprogrammed to walk a perfect life? of coures not. that is because there is choice, and the choices we make are what determines the outcome of our entire life. people mess up, but why? because their choices are influenced in bad ways."
2010-03-15 23:53:29 "conflict. nobody likes it, and yet it happens all the time. it occurs when two or more sides of a battle collide or have disagreements, and it rarely ends well. there are two kinds of conflict: personal and public. a personal conflict takes place as a person doubts themselves or has a moral dilemna. public conflict is just the spreading of the personal conflict to affect other parties."
2010-03-17 23:22:00 "no rain, no gain. hot sun, no fun.  sad "
2011-02-16 19:35:18 "some people escape by using drugs. others, sex. for me though, i find my escape in christ jesus."
2011-02-17 00:33:10 it's amazing how two days can feel like forever.
2011-02-17 16:12:37 "need the best repairman around? call on jesus. he's free, and always open."
2011-02-18 01:24:45 i miss frisbee.....
2011-02-18 05:04:59 monotony will kill us all.
2011-02-18 06:28:32 "what are peoples plans for monday(presidents day)? i want to have another halo ""party"". would you be interested?"

2011-02-24 00:51:51 "playing hacky sack on wet, slippery wood = not a good idea."
2011-02-24 20:33:25 "lets see how much you know about me. 4 of the following 6 statements are lies. the other 2 are truths. if you get it right, ill give you something special. 1. i like tomatoes.2. my upper arms have a circumference of 14 in. 3. i was stabbed in the right eye when i was little.4. clouds are my favorite part of nature. 5. i like all genres of music.6. i have never broken or sprained any part of my body."
2011-02-25 07:23:22 i feel sick. maybe i shouldn't have eaten that snow....
2011-02-28 16:14:25 i could say i hate mondays. or i could just say i hate school.

2011-03-03 04:01:01 who knew one person could e playful erience so much emotion?
2011-03-03 07:15:20 hi! because hello is just too complicated.
2011-03-04 15:58:37 im tired of being tired.
2011-03-04 17:09:07 it's amazing how reading the bible can comfort me so much. thank you god.
2011-03-05 02:05:33 "and i searched the world for a poem i could read, a rhyme that could bring <propfemale> to my <propmale>. but no writing i found was worthy of this god high above all other gods. what are my words compared to yours?  you speak in thunder and lightning, your voice shakes the mountains, the foundations of the earth. and all i can offer is this fragile breath, and with each one i'll praise you, i'll praise you more."
2011-03-06 07:54:47 "you can give up, or you can give yourself to christ. one leads to death, the other to eternal life in a paradise, heaven. hrm. such a tough decision."
2011-03-07 18:44:33 want to change your life? then go ahead. nothing is stopping you but yourself.
2011-03-08 06:27:55 sickness only makes being home alone worse.  sad 
2011-03-08 06:59:32 i hate the past. it deserves to be erased from memory forever. i dont care if the memories were good; they dont matter anymore. only our future in christ does.
2011-03-08 18:57:22 is it safe to drink shower water?
2011-03-09 01:24:06 i kind of really like mozilla firefox.
2011-03-09 02:42:51 i wish there were more people in the world that cared like i do.
2011-03-09 05:17:17 "a conversation is like playing tennis. if you dont return the ball, the conversation ends."
2011-03-09 22:13:27 """money is like a glove. friendship is like your hand. one is useful, the other essential."""
2011-03-10 01:28:38 doctors: masters of violation or helpers of humanity?
2011-03-10 06:20:56 "i feel sick. oh, wait. i am."
2011-03-10 19:56:53 prayer does not go unanswered.
2011-03-11 05:34:11 this weekend had better be good. i deserve it.
2011-03-11 18:38:47 we are social and sexual creatures. now that's a recipe for disaster without proper care.
