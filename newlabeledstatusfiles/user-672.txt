2011-07-04 22:32:07 thinks it's unfair how some people just get everything in their life handed to them while others have to struggle to get where they want to go  and in most cases the people who have everything given to them don't even appreciate what they have  they throw it away too easily because they're incapable of understanding the true value of it  this is something i greatly despise
