2010-11-15 02:14:56 grandma passed   
2010-11-01 10:48:50 even trick or treating down here was a nicer e playful erience   everyone we passed was was carrying their iced tea or beer in a cup and asked how we were doing   we were able to keep up with the football scores house to house   i can't wait until i shuck the cynicism i attained by leaving my southern roots for 12 years 
2010-11-16 20:34:44 "salve! i am off for a bit to make cheesy broccoli soup (or as the kids call it, cheesy tree soup)   i spent a little too long on latin today but it would be nice to string all the words i know into some sort of phrase that makes sense   vale "
2010-11-16 16:46:00 "for the first time in my life, i really just don't know what to say    i may have to resort to public journal writing again to encompass all that i am feeling "
