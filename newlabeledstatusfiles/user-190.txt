2009-09-19 15:23:51 "know what sucks, when there is this one person who the first time you saw them you thought they had absolutely one of the most lovable personalities and nicest smiles ever and you try to let them know that they mean so much to you in the little time you have around them and somewhat fail to do that then you keep in touch with them nearly every week you're not around them for a year and you see them only"
2009-09-19 15:21:55 "both times you plan to tell them that and fail each time, so you right one of the longest, heartfelt notes about them to show them the next time you're with them and when you finally find your grand <propmale> to see them and maybe finally tell them that they've meant more to you than anyone else you've ever known you find out that they've just got into a relationship with someone else."
2009-08-28 14:01:46 saw airforce one yesterday on <propmale> airforce base.

2010-09-06 23:33:47 first day of senior year tomorrow!
2010-07-28 00:50:09 "well, i didn't e playful ect today to go the way it did. i wound up hitting my head and learning what it was like to pass out cold with a concussion. ~"
2010-04-10 02:12:56 i've prioritized what i need to do to reach success. my main focus for now will be on boosting my processing/work speed. as i get better with that my time management should get better which means i'll be able to get more organized which will allow me to balance out school & other activities better which should open up more time for me to work on my book.
2010-07-07 03:06:41 just watched shutter island. talk about a clever movie.
2010-05-26 21:35:43 got the detailed report for the sat. i beat 95% of the kids at mashpee high school on the writing section and 98% on the mathematics. boo yah!
2010-05-29 12:32:13 "just relaxing in my backyard. know what, i feel like starting a facebook group. i think i'll do that."

2010-06-30 01:03:50 next time in school (academic-ly) it'll be senior year!
2010-08-12 04:35:06 "it's interesting to look at what a person may be faced with through out their lifetime. even if you consider your own life to be a pacifying one it's definitely something to look at what things build us up as we grow up and to see how, while in a lot of ways we may think so differently due to our different e playful eriences, in other ways we may actually think so much alike. -it all starts by looking at a singular person."
2010-04-19 02:29:56 "filmed the e playful anding horizons show friday night; went out to breakfast and saw a movie saturday; and went to a red sox game, went to an italian restaurant, and got desert from <propfirst>'s pastries in boston on sunday. it's been a good weekend."
2010-05-16 16:11:09 "why can it be so hard to take an initiative on something? if you take action with a goal things might not turn out as planned but if they turn out good, you've made a difference. opportunities have come my way & there's been people i've cared about before more than i've helped them to realize. i've been very happy with my life but there's cases i think back to where i'd have to say, i wish i took the initiative."
2010-05-15 09:34:45 just got home. i've been awake for 24 hours now. talk about an amazing night of prom and post-prom!
2010-05-23 01:13:04 working on storyboard for my book/future feature film.
2010-05-18 23:32:45 just got back from doing my first driving hours. - who'd think if you could drive a standard you could also drive an automatic? -just joking
2010-08-02 01:12:38 "it's amazing how much facts about society will be covered up: more than 66% of you can be persuaded to kill another human being simply because you lack the abilities to resist; the ""help save the planet"" slogan is one of the least successful slogans out there; it is usually as a result of stereotyping that stereotypes become true- call a child stupid enough times, they'll believe it to be true."
2010-07-06 02:19:00 wholly crap! i lost a lot of my <propfemale> white-ness after spending a whole day at the beach yesterday.
2010-05-26 00:37:27 driving's a lot more enjoyable when you know how to do it. my dad's volkswagon (an automatic) finally got fixed so now i'm pretty much going to be driving around in that most of the time.
2010-06-07 00:58:46 i'm trying to think of what's on my mind right now!
