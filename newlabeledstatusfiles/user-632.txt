2011-06-02 16:41:17 it takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach. a human hair can hold 3kg. the length of the penis is 3x the length of the thumb. the femur is as hard as concrete. a woman's heart beats faster then a man's. women blink 2x as much as men. we use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand. a woman has read this entire post. the man is still looking at his thumb. re-post if this made you laugh.  laugh 
2011-06-06 03:38:31 had a great weekend even though i stopped smoking 4 days ago!  i think i can do it this time and stop for good!  also... i found my cell phone and glasses today after a whole week of not having them!  things are looking up....lol.
2011-06-06 17:17:47 "woman's ass size study...there is a new study about women and how they feel about their ass's.the results were pretty interesting. 30% of women think their ass is too fat. 10% of women think their ass is too skinny. the remaining 60% say they don't care, they love him, he's a good man and wouldn't trade him for the world.. re-post if you want to make another woman laugh today : )"

2011-08-31 14:24:01 "i loved you the minute i heard you were coming. i loved you the second you were born. then, i saw your face and fell in love some more. you were only a minute old, but i knew i would die for you and to this day i still would. when you choose to have a child, you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body. put this on your status if you have children you love more than life."
2011-09-01 11:35:15 whew... it's way to early for me to be this wide awake & alert!

2011-01-24 05:07:49 "â€œyour time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. they somehow already know what you truly want to become. everything else is secondary."
2011-01-11 02:28:37 just got back from cape with <propfirst>'s new hamster.  the little critter managed to knaw a hole in the box and got loose in the car on the way home.  we named him houdini!
