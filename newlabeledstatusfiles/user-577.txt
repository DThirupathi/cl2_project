2010-07-15 17:01:04 is it wrong to keep something from an old relationship when you are in a serious long term relationship? even if you dont like that person anymore? what if someone you know does that? how do you know that they dont like that person anymore? what if they do? what if they still love them just a little bit? should that be confronted? give me some feedback. comment please!!

2010-06-16 20:44:50 always remember that it doesnt matter what a parent does to make you hate them. they are your parents. you do love them whether you want to admit it or not. tell them that or one day they might not be there when you want to talk it out.

2010-06-06 01:58:06 people need to make sure that they get their facts straight. sometimes people accuse others of doing things someone else did. remember that can hurt someone. please always check your facts before making an accusation.

2011-04-04 10:04:09 ok fell asleep up at work like ive done before (its always dead by 3 am) and never heard the phone ringing when the family tried to get ahold of me. why??? because someone turned the ringer off!! i didnt even know you could do that!
2011-04-07 06:43:29 there is a song called unanswered prayers. today made me realize that god takes his time answering prayers. but that doesnt mean he didnt hear them or is ignoring them. he knows just the right time to answer them. today was a miracle.
