"summer: going to bed at 4 am, getting up at 12, forgetting to eat/pee/shower, and sitting in front of the computer for the entire day. i need a job."
also: it is raining.
"going to bed. it's uh, 5 am."
the feeling has gone only you and i it means nothing to me this means nothing to me - ultravox. only not really. am i really that pitiful that i post lyrics for other people? yes. i also answer my own questions. lord...
"the highlight of today will be purchasing a stopper for the bathtub. hell, it's better than homework."

i need a popsicle. :[
well now what?
just went to concord mills with three amazing people.
just purchased a $40 subscription to a math site for school...fml. gotta run and deposit a check before school because i get out at 5 today!!! enjoy the structure and free classes of high school while you can!
mathxl & english report...ugh!
i've got jury duty. fml
going home in a few minutes.
got a black mustang! (can't drive it for another month though...)
english homework...and hoping my math professor emails me back soon!
going outside. accomplishment of the week thus far. unless you count that i finished a written entry for a contest. but nobody counts that.
"eat fried chicken, write an essay, attempt math, go to sleep."
class at 8. the dreaded chem lab...
"""you got crazy legs, you got amazing head/you got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red."" i only wish i'd be born a couple decades earlier so i could have seen that in concert."
"first soc 1101 test tomorrow, and what am i doing? writing horrible stories and playing sims."
am i the only person in the world who doesn't understand college algebra? pretty sure i bombed my first test.
you never know how much nothing can mean to you until you've been on the losing side of unrequited love.
"5 minute math class, pretty awesome."
humanity: the all mighty's third-grade science fair entry. even masters of the universe have a trial and error period.
i've had a headache for two days straight and now i smell smoke. no means no co...
"i just spent 30+ minutes perfecting my jury duty postponement request, researching alternate dates and school holidays that coincided with <propmale> county's schedule. when i sat down to write my first avaliable date, a school recess on october 12th, i realized that was the day i had been assigned in the first place. fml"
"gym at 8 smile 0 am, turn in job application, stop by student publications,  join ans, and then die of exhaustion somewhere in between."
why do we possess love and empathy for those who treat us like dirt? humans are a masochistic species indeed...
i guess i should kind of return the library books i renewed two weeks ago and still never read.
"hasn't studied for the first algebra exam, so i will be cramming tonight."
visit i'm from gastonia and i love <propfirst>'s! had a nice big strawberry shake today. p:
i have never hated anything the way i hate math.
do you have a driver's license/pay for car insurance? do you vote like a responsible citizen? congratulations you have received one free jury duty. you might even get to miss two really important midterms.
"things are getting better in every respect.  smile  however, commuter parking at uncc may be the end of me. :[ but otherwise, glorious!  smile "

truck turned over on my exit. :[ stay away from belmont on i-85!
"also, why do people type in their accent/dialect?  indecision "
sitting in the cafe trying to remember algebra...and kind of hoping a certain slacker doesn't get away with not doing a damn thing this time around.
"every other college in the united states of <propfemale> is on fall break. thank you, uncc, for extending my school week and scheduling the break on the day i was assigned jury duty."

medication's ironic and unnecessary side effects: pharmacists way of getting back at the kids who picked on them when they were nerdy little pariahs.
"dear microsoft word 2003: i will always prefer you to that shiny ms word 2007 that defaults in calibri font and impossible formatting, but really, ""sniffily"" is a word."
studying for chem test.  annoyed 
i've caught up to the nano minimum of 10k...i might finish this novel after all! i guess all i needed was to be abandoned after taking a discouraging chemistry test and suffering horrible stomach aches all week to motivate me!  smile

i'm thoroughly convinced the source of my avoidance of human interaction is the fact that my choices of socialization are people too young to know or people too old to hear.
"eh, forget being depressed... i'm painting my toenails and playing pokemon for the rest of the night.  love "
"there's nothing like hoarding money to make you want to compulsively spend it all on useless items. not little things. cars. vacations. airplanes. now go screw yourself conscience, and stop making me feel guilty about wanting to get a damn ds lite four years after it came out."
"i love what youtube commercials have done to people. threats of suicide, killing sprees, and computer destruction all because of a 30 second interruption you can mute."
"time may heal all wounds, but it makes for one frigid nurse."
is very inspired by the community's outcry to keep mecklenburg's public libraries open. people and the media can still make a difference.
