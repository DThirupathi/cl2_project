2009-09-30 20:26:04 "gym at 8 smile 0 am, turn in job application, stop by student publications,  join ans, and then die of exhaustion somewhere in between."
2009-08-04 16:04:30 why do we possess love and empathy for those who treat us like dirt? humans are a masochistic species indeed...

2009-09-29 22:05:59 didn't get a good parking space this morning and was kind of irked. passed about a dozen cars parked right up front with citations when i got out of class.  smile  sweet schadenfreude.
2009-10-15 22:05:43 "dear uncc student(s) who vandalized the hillel display: when do you people find time to do these things? and how in blazes did you manage to sneak away unnoticed carrying a roof? get a freakin' life, people..."

2009-11-07 02:25:38 i've caught up to the nano minimum of 10k...i might finish this novel after all! i guess all i needed was to be abandoned after taking a discouraging chemistry test and suffering horrible stomach aches all week to motivate me!  smile

2011-03-04 17:07:58 got invited to a graduate level class by my boss. the fact that i'm excited marks rock bottom in my nerdiness.

2011-03-08 22:36:23 i deal far too much with irbs and hipaa to be anything but a licensed doctor by now.
2011-03-09 00:42:50 smoke alarm went off. cat is under the bed for an indeterminate duration of time.
2011-03-09 01:55:42 that awkward moment when you are no longer under the disillusionment of your medication and realize your cat is the only one that loves you.

2011-03-27 02:59:31 suckerpunch was actually a lot better than i anticipated.
2011-03-28 05:19:59 diffusion of responsibility can suck it -- someone call the damn cops when an alarm has been going off for 15 minutes.
2011-03-29 03:42:44 got into a cognitive psych lab for next semester! my <propmale> year is going to be supaa busy.

2011-04-26 18:37:02 time to go outside the house and take a test.

2011-05-08 01:32:24 went to the u.s. national whitewater center today and got the most awkward sunburn ever.
2011-05-08 16:31:18 always look on the bright side of life!
2011-05-09 18:13:30 "i'm really not feeling this paper. almost done, and then cognitive psych final..."

2010-07-13 03:41:11 i don't know why i kid myself anymore. nothing but retrograde amnesia is going to allow me to be happy.
2010-10-28 13:19:42 "another busy day...english, psych, work, and never let me go later tonight! anyone else going to see that movie?  smile "
2010-03-21 01:09:13 had a wonderful weekend with <propmale> watson.  smile 
2010-08-26 17:35:11 "drove for five <propmale> before realizing she had left her phone on top of the car. thanked god, the laws of physics, and the makers of ford roofs after finding it still in place."
2010-03-23 01:38:29 "stats is slowing working its way up to the top of the ""why in hell do i need this"" list."

2010-11-01 14:18:14 beginning my second novel today. good luck to everyone else who is participating in nanowrimo.
2010-06-08 13:55:23 looks like i need a second dose of varicella. apparently you can go twenty years without ever having chickenpox...
2011-01-21 18:29:42 "just got done with my interview (thinking it went well, but we'll have to wait and see), and now i'm finishing up some work at the sanskrit office!"
2010-05-03 03:01:25 "someday i'm going to change. future me isn't going to put off stats homework, an english paper, theatre extra credit, and hours worth of western civ lectures until the last minute. hopefully because i won't have those classes again..."
2010-11-03 12:02:42 paper due friday and a speech due monday...there's got to be more to life.
2010-03-21 19:37:37 "guess i'm finally going to see <propfemale> in wonderland. the last movie i saw in theatres was avatar, if that says anything about my violated trust in hype."
2010-03-24 01:11:54 "apparently noda is too edgy to have a facebook <propfemale>. guess i'll have to track all their events via word of mouth and left of the dial. oh, and on that handy-dandy 21st century web<propfemale>. hippies."
2010-11-08 02:23:56 living involves tearing up one rough draft after another.
2011-01-23 04:48:32 unc-tv has a good feature on <propfirst> roddenberry on right now.

2011-01-30 01:31:22 "busy!!! completing my citiprogram training, working on theory and fiction writing homework, and reading over the lab for monday."
2010-05-20 23:24:16 enjoyed the short trip to noda today. at least i won't get too lost if i go there saturday.
2010-04-01 20:24:00 "well, i got my classes after all: public speaking (required), abnormal psych, writing about literature, hebrew scriptures, and latin. four of five correlate to my majors. awesome switch or what? unemployment never looked so fun."
2010-11-26 17:21:12 livin' off pralines and cornbread.

2010-03-29 12:57:09 is prepared to get a crap grade on this english paper. i don't see why i need to have a completed paper if this is the first draft! -_-
2010-03-27 19:40:02 "did i request thee, maker, from my <propmale> to mold me man? did i solicit  thee from darkness to promote me?"
2010-03-22 05:57:08 "i don't have everyone backing me that'd i'd like, but tomorrow (or today, i should say) i'm changing majors."
2010-04-06 03:47:05 i'm thoroughly convinced the source of my avoidance of human interaction is the fact that my choices of socialization are people too young to know or people too old to hear.
2010-07-02 02:51:07 "eh, forget being depressed... i'm painting my toenails and playing pokemon for the rest of the night.  love "
2010-03-23 23:37:06 "there's nothing like hoarding money to make you want to compulsively spend it all on useless items. not little things. cars. vacations. airplanes. now go screw yourself conscience, and stop making me feel guilty about wanting to get a damn ds lite four years after it came out."
2010-08-01 02:51:23 "i love what youtube commercials have done to people. threats of suicide, killing sprees, and computer destruction all because of a 30 second interruption you can mute."
2010-06-24 00:56:12 "time may heal all wounds, but it makes for one frigid nurse."
2010-03-24 22:05:49 is very inspired by the community's outcry to keep mecklenburg's public libraries open. people and the media can still make a difference.
2010-04-05 05:07:11 there is nothing quite as thrilling as putting off a boring report until mere hours before it is due.
