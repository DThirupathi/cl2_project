"fearful (""erm...i better not..."")you have a fearful relationship style. fearful people tend to think of themselves as unlovable, and of others as untrustworthy or rejecting. therefore, they protect themselves from rejection by avoiding close relationships, resulting in low levels of romantic or social involvement. they find it hard to rely on others, seldom disclose themselves to others, and probably rarely find someone whom they can confide in when they are upset. their interpersonal style is characterized by lack of assertiveness and social inhibition. fearful people can consider developing a healthy self-image and a more positive view of others."
