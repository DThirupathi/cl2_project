2009-10-01 22:01:11 "is still has a problem with my laptop despite having the operating system reinstalled. dell: fail, vista: fail, microsoft: fail, modern technology: fail. i am seriously considering becoming amish or else turning feral and going off to live in the bush, far away from modern 'convieniences'."

2010-11-04 10:29:39 its more than slightly depressing seeing everyone's posts about finishing exams and in some cases their degree when i have just had my first two exams today and still have another one tomorrow morning. i am so looking forward to 12 smile 0pm tomorrow when i can disengage my brain and partake of activities that require little to no cognitive function; like playing old dos games on my computer.
