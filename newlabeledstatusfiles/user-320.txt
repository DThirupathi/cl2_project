2009-12-31 13:22:36 is annoyed that the guy she bought her car from didn't give her the code to reset the stereo - meaning she has to drive around in silence until the new stereo is installed (although it is lucky that the new stereo was already ordered).

2010-02-22 11:04:52 "i woke up at least an hour before my alarm went off, two days in a row, and i don't feel tired. for someone who usually sleeps through the night for at least eight hours, this is very strange."

2010-04-17 03:47:25 "so it turns out the stray <propfemale> we've been feeding is declawed! but not neutered. who the heck does that to a cat??? our cats all have their claws, so we'll  have to find him a home."
2010-04-23 16:46:47 the stray <propfemale> (<propmale>) is begging to come inside and his sad meows are breaking my heart.
2010-03-30 23:09:09 feels much better after going for a run on this gorgeous afternoon and then finally taking a shower.
2010-07-19 23:36:03 we finally have a vinegar barrel! now we can make red wine vinegar with leftover wine.
2010-03-31 18:57:49 "laughing at the end of this ap article on the flooding in new england:  'demetri skalkos, c surprise wner of mcnamara's liquor store, said about three feet of water stood in the basement. he said he was worried about losing business over the traditionally busy easter period.""this is the holy week,"" he said. ""... if we don't do business now, when are we going to do business?""'"
2010-04-19 00:10:08 "is laughing at the neighbors' 3-yr-old granddaughter, who is calling our cat. ""le-loy! le-loy!"" this is an quite an achievement since last year, when she called, ""le-woy! le-woy!"""
2010-05-04 14:41:58 "ran the first mile or so of my run today in the huaraches, then switched back to running shoes for the rest. the huaraches felt so good, i may try to do my entire run in them tomorrow. my running shoes felt heavy and awkward in comparison."
2010-04-28 03:56:51 "really wants to see <propmale> waters/the wall in october. really, really, really wants to."
2010-04-19 22:14:09 "apparently, we have the same problem with gardening that we have with cats... we're starting more seeds!"
2010-04-07 00:59:42 "is going to spend the rest of spring hanging out on the patio drinking beer, as long as it's not raining. you're all invited to join me."
2010-04-21 19:42:52 "well, i made it through another aquarium crisis, but not without losing a few fish (all the siamese algae eaters, unfortunately)."
2010-05-11 14:46:22 "hoping to get lots of writing done today - i cleaned the house yesterday so i wouldn't have any excuse not to write! if all else fails, at least the house is clean, i guess."
2011-01-05 15:19:41 so nice to be back to the regular routine - two days off in a row and time to write makes me very happy.
2010-05-11 20:23:14 first load of laundry is now on the new clothesline! exciting - or about as exciting as it gets around here during the day.
2010-07-30 22:51:57 goldfinches all over the yard!
2010-06-06 21:14:31 "is home again. i have to admit, it was nice to get off work an hour early."
2010-05-14 15:27:22 "really likes the new yahoo mail format - if you're using yahoo, switch to the new format! more like outlook (preview pane, automatically checks for new messages) and easier on the eyes. calendar opens in a new tab, too."
2010-09-26 16:59:48 "just got back from a great walk around south city with <propfirst>. so many bosnian bakeries, bars and pizza places!"
2010-04-09 15:12:42 "two stray cats are arguing in the back yard (one who's been hanging around and another i haven't seen before). we're hoping we can get the one who's been hanging around into the vet and get her spade soon, preferably before she has kittens."
2010-05-08 14:35:15 getting ready to go out to lunch with our moms to celebrate mother's day.

2010-04-28 22:48:09 "is behind a warehouse near soccer park, where <propfirst> buys grain for brewing. strange watching lots of people buy what i guess is black market grain."

2010-05-12 14:31:54 "dear ed: cat food is supposed to be eaten on a plate, not moved to the floor and eaten while standing on the plate. thank you. the management."
2010-05-10 14:06:53 <propfirst> made me a removable clothesline for the backyard last night and i forgot to take it down. oops.
2010-05-28 16:30:20 got some funny looks today while running in my huaraches.
2010-05-21 17:12:48 "on today's agenda: homemade mozzarella, brewing and maybe - please let this happen - blackberry wine. half of our freezer space is taken up by blackberries."
2010-05-30 04:17:59 hanging out at the embassy with good friends. brings back memories!
2010-11-04 18:06:19 "i'm up to 75 fiction submissions for the year (i sent 5 out today). my goal is 100, so assuming i won't be sending anything out the weeks of thanksgiving and christmas, i've got a lot of work to do during the remaining weeks."
2010-08-29 18:58:42 "this is kind of last minute, but i'm reading at duff's tomorrow night (starts at 7 smile 0) with <propfemale> rankovic and others. we'll be reading from are we feeling better yet? women speak about health care in <propfemale>, which was published by st. <propfirst>'s own penultimate press. my essay is about the exciting times i had with thyroid cancer. i think the cover charge will be $5."
2010-05-13 12:26:38 "two more shifts, then vacation!"
2010-11-08 00:51:58 "i cleaned my car today, inside and out, for the first time since i got it last year. now it's all shiny and weird looking."

2010-04-30 14:22:10 "i am so glad coffee is part of my life. without it, i'd still be in bed."
2010-05-21 01:53:25 "today i made strawberry preserves (with strawberries from our garden) and turnip greens from fair shares and the farmer's market as part of dinner. tomorrow <propfirst>'s brewing beer and i'm helping (helping him drink beer, that is, but don't tell)."
2010-05-15 03:30:17 "celebrating the beginning of staycation (i hate that word - can't i just use vacation and you all just know i'm not really going anywhere???) with schlafly schwartz beer. all is well in the world - except that word, of course."
2010-06-09 17:23:33 had a great time at <propmale>'s shut-ins and is sorry to be home now.
2010-05-04 11:22:41 today is <propmale>'s big day - he finally gets to go to the vet! (<propmale>'s the stray cat we've been feeding.)

2010-05-26 23:41:39 the new lcd soundsystem is a lot better than the new band of horses.
2010-06-15 17:04:15 "ran 3 <propmale> in the huaraches (longest yet), plus a 1 mile walk home, because i'd planned to run 4 <propmale> but the heat got to me. i will get up earlier tomorrow morning and try again."
2010-06-29 15:11:27 i can't decide what i want to do first today: run or write?
2010-05-25 23:22:09 "we just put a little, bitty baby bird back in the nest its parents built in our eaves on the back of the house. hope it survives!"
2010-05-14 17:23:44 is only one shift away from vacation/staycation!!!! hoping tonight will fly by - or at least pass without any <propmale> incidents like last night's power outage.  smile 
2010-07-13 07:35:20 remerch complete! now on to my weekend...
2010-07-14 20:58:04 "i set a goal to make 100 fiction submissions this year - so far i've submitted 44 times (i had a few bad weeks and got a little behind). 17 submissions are still out. three stories have been accepted for publication, and one has been a contest finalist twice (one of the contests hasn't been decided yet, so there's still hope). whether this is good or bad, i don't know, but it's what i'm doing."
2010-09-07 17:16:50 i spent the entire morning updating my blackberry and now i have rhapsody on my phone! so much better than pandora...
2010-05-19 15:50:01 is making banana bread.
2010-12-25 05:01:56 "christmas part 2 - <propfirst>'s mom's house. so far, so good."
2010-06-24 23:49:09 phase 1 of strawberry cordial making has begun. unless you want to call the sort-of-embarrassing part where i bought everclear at the liquor store phase 1 - in which case this if phase 2.

2010-12-30 03:25:53 is a $25 outfit still a great deal if i bought $50 boots to go with it?
2010-12-08 04:49:26 some weeks are longer than others. glad i have the next two days off!
2010-06-11 00:11:31 "enjoyed the cherries from fair shares so much, i'm going to try to start some trees from the seeds."
2010-05-27 18:44:06 "would rather garden than go back to work, but will go back to work anyhow, because she said she would."
2010-06-16 23:57:35 "picked up some ozark <propmale> edlerflower cordial at the bottleworks farmer's market this afternoon, and it's pretty damn tasty."
2010-07-05 17:09:08 "lots of stuff to do today: errands, laundry, cleaning... so why have i been sitting around reading all morning?"
2010-11-18 12:27:37 i seem to have mysteriously picked up two friends on national unfriend day.
2010-05-31 17:05:42 weeding the garden today and trying to decide if we want to be on the neighborhood garden tour...
2010-09-15 22:06:01 "making sunchoke and leek soup for dinner, but after standing over a hot pot of soup, i think it's too warm for soup!"
2010-05-26 13:19:17 last day of staycation...
2010-06-15 04:15:04 it's my weekend!!!! not that i'm happy about that or anything.  smile

2010-06-13 17:40:46 finally ordered blackout curtains for the bedroom - no more waking up at sunrise every day! i feel better already.
2010-07-14 12:26:53 has gotten a lot of sleep lately - i went to bed before 9 last night and didn't get up until 7!
2010-06-01 04:40:01 it's my weekend! i think a beer is in order...
2011-02-05 23:12:28 "cleaning and drinking, drinking and cleaning."
2010-09-07 04:23:50 homemade strawberry liqueur - who knew how good it would be???
2010-07-16 19:28:47 rough work day is over. now i am going to be disciplined and write (instead of having a drink).
2010-10-14 03:31:15 "you and i wake up in jail together. using only four words, what would you say to me? (note: if you comment, copy and paste this into your status. )"
2010-07-02 19:42:48 i don't want to do anything else today. maybe i need a nap...
2010-07-20 23:56:14 "enjoyed a great dinner of fresh pasta from mangia italiano, roasted peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and <propfemale> oil."
2010-10-18 17:16:27 "recovering from an awesome weekend - old friends, new friends, a fun party, good food, a bearded dragon - what more could a person want?"
2010-07-27 22:49:43 "another e playful eriment in my ongoing attempts to use up all the food we're getting from fair shares. who knew corn pudding baked in a cast-iron skillet would be so good? the only non-fs ingredients were sugar and salt. if i'd been thinking, i probably could have used a sweetener from fs."
2010-07-31 15:14:10 the garden is weeded once again (including giant tree-size weeds that i think are coming over from the abandoned house next door). i wish it would stay that way!
2010-07-11 02:20:14 "having a beer while my summer squash and polenta casserole bakes. this involves three of my favorite things: using the vegetables we get from fair shares, casseroles, and, of course, beer."
2010-07-04 22:54:18 "is hanging out with 2 kids watching curious <propfirst>. worse things have happened, right?"
2010-12-03 21:29:37 "change your profile picture to a cartoon character from your childhood. the goal is to raise awareness about child abuse. (i was in college when the tick was on, but that's kind of like extended childhood, right?)"
2010-08-03 16:21:15 about to do something productive... any second now ...
2010-10-28 00:50:34 "any of my writer friends doing nanowrimo? i'm thinking about trying do some writing every day, but not doing a novel."
2010-07-26 14:34:09 my friday has finally arrived.
2010-08-04 12:44:41 "started coffee this morning, ran outside to rescue a <propfemale> mouse from the cats, came back in, forgot about the coffee, then wondered why i was still half asleep. finally have coffee and feeling better. hopefully that mouse is, too."
2010-08-03 19:07:42 "barndominium: a type of house that includes living space attached to a workshop, a barn (typically for horses), or a large vehicles such as a recreational vehicle or a good-sized recreational boat. (thanks, wikipedia!)"
2010-11-03 21:12:51 why is the ice cream truck still cruising the neighborhood? don't they know it's cold out? and why does the song it plays sound so much like my phone? that's just annoying.
2010-06-26 23:04:10 "especially thankful for this cocktail after one of the longest days at work. nothing went wrong, but time crept along in such a way that looking at the clock was torture."
2010-08-04 01:48:10 "we had a good time at the neighborhood picnic/national night out, but it sure is nice to  be back in the air conditioning."
2010-10-31 22:18:16 we've got new guppies! six fancy ones. they're purty.
2010-12-16 21:00:55 "submitting takes so much time, but i only have 13 to go and i can call it quits for the year."
2010-06-23 14:39:36 tried to get up at 5 smile 0 (when <propfirst> gets up) so i could run early... but ended up sleeping 'til 7 surprise 0. still got my run in but it was already hot and <propfemale> on the trail at 8 surprise 0.
2010-06-22 04:49:12 why am i not in bed already???
2010-07-30 19:41:11 "said by a customer at the store today: ""do you know why i can't find the pine nuts?"" well, no. not really."
2010-12-15 15:01:21 "day 3 of a 4-day writing week. wish every week worked out this way. of course, this also means i'm not decorating for christmas, sending out cards or wrapping presents, but i'm okay with that."
2010-07-28 01:36:46 "this evening i knitted something (on a knitting loom). not anything recognizable or usable, but something all the same."
2010-06-29 20:03:02 "once again, running destroyed my ability to focus on writing. why why why does that happen???"
2010-07-18 14:49:48 "i love the spectacle of summer storms. not having to water the garden today is a nice bonus, too."
2010-09-04 14:04:55 looks like it's going to be another beautiful day!
2010-08-01 16:15:23 "went on a very nice barefoot walk with <propfirst> this morning. it's a beautiful day. we saw way more cyclists than usual, and in big groups, too - guess there's something going on in the st. <propfirst> biking world today."
2011-02-09 16:53:22 a man in the restroom here at work just called the store to ask if someone could bring him more toilet paper.
2011-01-19 17:15:47 "<propfirst> called and i realized when i started talking to him that i have laryngitis. he said i should have known that, because i should have been talking to the cats, and now the cats probably think i'm mad at them because i haven't been talking to them all day.  smile "
2011-01-10 15:17:24 "so my day of no electronics went well. it's nice to be back, but it was also nice to be away. i guess it is like a mini-vacation of sorts."
2010-07-09 19:46:59 "doesn't understand why people feel compelled to ask grocery store cashiers if they ""believe."""
2010-11-04 13:55:10 "i'm writing today - and i'm no longer going to mention that other thing i do in my status, even though i'm going in this afternoon."
2010-07-25 17:04:58 is exhausted and ready for this week to be over.
2010-07-12 19:00:24 remerch tonight! woo hoo! ... sigh.

2010-08-07 23:48:15 "we went to the zoo for the first time in years today. a lot has changed... but most importantly, i saw two baby lemurs!"
2010-08-31 21:16:18 off to the vet with <propmale>. poor little guy is dizzy and seems to have an ear problem.  sad 
2010-08-23 19:06:24 "one nice thing about the neighbor's overgrown back yard, which i have a clear view of now that i moved my desk, is that butterflies love it over there."
2010-12-08 15:42:57 "steps toward revising my novel: taking notes on <propfirst>'s thoughts, printing up various sections for cutting, buying a book on revision. now all i have to do is start revising."
2010-08-16 14:23:54 "on saturday we got <propmale> a nice red collar. today, i get up and there's <propmale>, sitting in the kitchen, naked again. no red collar anywhere."
2010-08-31 14:44:51 going to get my hair cut by the fabulous <propfemale> today!
2010-09-27 17:42:05 "any minute now, i'm going to feel wide awake and motivated to do something. yes, any minute now..."
2010-09-21 01:40:46 "had a great time tonight at the royale with <propfirst>, <propfirst> and <propfirst>."
2010-07-31 17:45:32 "zucchini bread turns out to be a great way to use all that summer squash. i used a recipe that included cinnamon, curry powder, nuts and dried apricots (the recipe wanted dried <propfemale>, but i had apricots on hand). it's quite tasty!"
2010-08-02 16:48:23 i need a nap.
2010-10-21 13:36:34 i slept so much the last couple days that i felt like i was drugged. then i dreamed that someone from work was slipping me pain killers. hmm....
2010-09-15 09:11:50 can't believe my weekend is over already... and guess what? i'm opening again!
2010-09-09 19:33:31 "day 2 of my 5-day stretch of all opening shifts - so far, so good. we survived the big meat/cheese remerch."
2010-09-23 09:14:27 "looking forward the tonight's ""deck people"" reunion at the embassy (and also to the nap that will happen after work, before the party)."

2010-08-28 05:15:16 "if you're at the grocery store and you decide you don't want something in your cart, please don't leave it in the frozen section, because that's what everyone else does, and you want to be different, right???"
2010-11-21 05:05:15 so nice to be off my feet!
2010-09-16 20:20:24 it's a gorgeous day for a nap.
2010-08-17 15:34:23 did my first truly barefoot outdoors run today! only one person asked me where my shoes were.

2010-08-28 14:02:13 going to the festival of nations today.

2010-08-17 04:16:21 "<propmale> and meep meep are wrestling in the nearly dark living room. meep meep is solid black, so it looks like <propmale> has lost his mind. poor <propmale> - collar and mind in only two days."
2010-08-16 03:57:09 "one more day of work, then my weekend! then one day of work followed by a 5-day weekend. i guess i can't complain."
2011-02-11 16:24:42 a reminder to my writing friends - small press publishing panel at umsl tonight at 6 surprise 0! all the details below.
2010-09-01 23:05:18 so it turns out i like eggplant if i prepare it myself. who knew?

2010-11-13 19:32:31 i love my new phone!
2010-11-12 17:08:36 is it bad if all i plan to do today is kill time until my new phone gets here?
2010-10-24 16:20:33 how come it took me so long to discover that tea is better than coffee for hangovers? guess i shouldn't complain - at least i know now.
2011-01-21 00:07:07 "got my new pedometer last night and wore it all day today. i think it's going to work. i may be a <propfemale> bit competitive, even with myself."
2010-10-19 23:47:14 thanks for all the birthday wishes! i love facebook birthdays.  smile 
2011-01-20 14:18:46 somehow i let myself go from revising my novel to reading about revising novels. i think that's been going on for weeks now.
2010-10-14 18:16:22 "looks like our dryer is broken - it tumbles but there's no heat. should i see if it can be repaired, replace it, or switch over completely to line drying? i line-dried everything this summer but it takes a lot longer now that the temperature has cooled."
2010-09-25 12:53:02 "neighborhood garage sale today! hoping for lots of good, cheap stuff (i mean stuff that is a good value, of course)."
2011-01-29 18:44:36 just got back from a nice walk to carondelet park with <propfirst> janssen. it's such a beautiful day!

2010-10-11 00:25:12 "we're back from the cabin in steelville, but i wish i was still there."
2010-10-13 21:44:55 i probably should have taken a nap instead of drinking a pot of coffee.
2010-09-18 22:28:55 "going across the river for my cousin <propmale>'s wedding reception, the kind of reception you can wear jeans to because that's what they got married in. so i'm wearing jeans. which is weird. so i put on some makeup and jewelry to compensate."
2010-11-07 16:55:28 yesterday i received the fastest ever rejection on a writing submission - 24 hours!
2010-11-18 14:46:09 just finished my first workout in nearly a month! why do i ever stop??? i feel great.
2010-09-21 17:09:58 "i wrote something new this morning. it probably sucks, but it's out there and that's always a relief."
2010-10-30 04:26:56 why didn't i go see <propmale> waters do the wall tonight? why why why???
2010-09-30 21:21:50 who knew steering wheel covers were such a pita to put on??? and now it's slightly crooked so all the little skulls look like they're tilting their heads quizzically.
2010-11-17 22:04:37 "crazy neighbor who abandoned his house earlier this year is back today. he's mowing his lawn - that makes twice this year, i think."
2010-11-07 01:37:35 "so this day five of a green tea and lemon juice fast - one, i survived, and two, to my surprise, i feel great. looking forward to eating tomorrow, though!"
2010-11-02 09:26:48 get out and vote today!

2010-11-21 15:54:20 the cats wait by the vents for the heat to come on. it's pretty cute.
2010-10-11 22:49:10 "our cat <propmale> is missing. we haven't seen him since before we went out of town this weekend. if you live in the area, please look out for him. he has short yellow-orange fur with white stripes, and the stripes make circles on his sides. he's wearing an orange plaid collar with a <propfemale> and tag."

2010-12-20 14:46:48 "all that work sending out submissions is paying off. i've got stories forthcoming in the linnet's wings, natural bridge and <propmale>'s ferry review."
2010-11-30 19:03:19 """drag your thoughts away from your troubles... by the ears, by the heels, or any other way you can manage it."" happy birthday, <propfirst> twain."
2010-11-14 23:42:36 i just had the best fruit salad ever and the secret ingredient is coconut milk.
2010-12-04 09:10:00 nothing quite like waking up at 2am for a 5am shift and not being able to go back to sleep.  sad 
2010-12-01 14:54:45 "a cat ""chirping"" at birds always makes me smile."
2010-12-16 14:07:24 "on <propfemale> 49 of 576 of freedom, by <propmale> franzen http annoyed /bit.ly/gfzrss"
2010-11-03 15:32:17 "nothing quite like coming into work at 5am only to find that the power is out. fun, fun!"
2010-11-08 19:04:47 "the father of the man who more-or-less abandoned the house next door is in the backyard, cutting down the overgrown weeds with a small hatchet. should i be worried?"
2010-12-03 23:50:22 <propmale> lost another collar. some of the other cats have had the same collar their entire lives and <propmale> can't keep one on for three days.
2010-12-02 17:29:51 "time to start revising my novel. <propfirst> janssen was kind enough to read the first draft and give me feedback, so i've got lots to work on.  smile "
2010-12-22 20:49:02 "i did it! 100 submissions sent out in 2010. six acceptances. 40 submissions still out. one story went to 17 markets, was twice a semi-finalist in contests, yet still hasn't found a home. another was accepted the second time i sent it out. such is the writing life..."
2010-11-14 15:34:25 ew! dead mouse gift on the porch mat this morning.
2010-11-14 14:04:41 had a nice dinner at hawthorne inn last night - they can make even the bland food <propfirst> and i are eating taste good!
2010-11-25 19:02:15 nice relaxing thanksgiving so far. let's hope it stays that way!
2011-01-30 16:05:47 "going to read for a while and then do nothing for a while (thanks for the great nothing plan, <propfemale> cipponeri)."
2010-12-18 01:01:06 you know those chirping noise cats make when they watch birds? <propmale> is making them for the aquarium fish.
2010-12-24 00:27:37 at <propfirst>'s dad's house - christmas part 1.
2011-01-06 15:40:15 "happy anniversary, <propfirst> janssen! thank you for the best seven years of my life so far!"

2010-12-07 16:33:10 i'm only 14 submissions away from my goal of 100 submissions this year...
2010-12-18 23:54:07 "going caroling with the neighbors tonight. i'm not sure i've ever been caroling before, and i can't sing, but i've been assured that won't matter.  smile "
2011-01-20 18:37:14 "from the comments on a lifehacker article about android phone annoyances: ""my biggest problem is that it lets people call me and interrupt my game of angry birds. if i'd wanted a phone i wouldn't have bought a small computer."""
2011-01-07 16:58:38 "one of my resolutions (borrowed from a friend - thanks <propfirst>!) is to go electronics-free one day a week. tomorrow will be that day. no laptop, phone used only as a phone. honestly, i 'm a little nervous about it, which i'm sure means i really need to do it."
2011-01-28 13:26:47 three days off! i'm so excited i woke up at 6am...  annoyed 
2011-02-01 13:49:04 snow day! thanks to capt. <propfirst> for letting me stay home today. my driving-in-a-blizzard skills are completely untested and i'd like things to stay that way.
2010-12-25 21:25:42 christmas part 3 - at my brother's house.
2010-12-20 16:17:03 anyone thinking about staying up to see the eclipse tonight?
2011-02-09 10:27:43 i'm ready for spring! and i'd like to stay inside until it gets here.
2011-01-28 18:20:46 i need a name for a fictional bar in the ozarks. any ideas?
2011-01-12 16:05:38 "i love revising. i love revising. i love revising. (if i say it enough, it will come true, right???) i love revising. i love revising..."
2011-02-05 13:09:37 what is this all this snow doing here?!? three inches here in the city and it's still coming down.
2011-01-29 21:07:43 i just made a huge batch of applesauce with all the apples we've been saving from fair shares. it turned out great!
2011-01-13 21:22:44 "good news - my flash fiction ""lost"" placed second in the borges prose contest at caper literary journal. it will be published online and in the 2010 anthology."
2010-02-26 06:11:39 is kind of curious how the cats are making so much noise in the other room... but not enough to get up and check.
2010-03-05 17:30:29 this is perfect weather for running - and just about anything else.
2011-02-16 23:45:18 "i'm ready to start gardening. guess i'll get out the seeds and, like i do every year, start about ten times as many plants as we have space for."
2011-02-17 18:41:08 "i made homemade tapioca pudding for the first time today. next time i'll make a double batch so <propfirst> can have some, too.  wink "

2011-02-24 03:38:43 "finished with the samaritan, by <propfirst> venturini http annoyed /goodreads.com/user_status/show/5159135"
2011-02-25 16:35:11 vacation! finally
2011-02-26 15:02:28 i need a bigger suitcase. or less stuff.
2011-02-28 03:06:44 high altitude drinking - holy shit! happy inlaws!
2011-03-01 03:49:59 ski school tomorrow at copper mountain for me. here's to not breaking anything!
2011-03-02 15:44:15 "to recover from yesterday's skiing debacle, i'm going hiking today. we found an 11 mile trail right behind the condo."
2011-03-02 21:00:03 next up - tubing.
2010-03-10 13:28:32 "dreamed i was neglecting housework and the cats and plants were dying. i may not be the best housekeeper, but everything is still alive."
2011-03-04 16:32:17 "packing up the <propfirst>. we'll walk around until <propfirst> is finished snow boarding, then we're staying with some relatives outside of <propmale> tonight."
2011-03-07 03:04:39 spending the day reading a good book is a pretty good way to transition from vacation to work. i think. we'll see how work goes tomorrow.
2011-03-08 04:55:28 "we got a package in the mail today, which means the cats are in for a wild night of box hopping!"
2011-03-09 00:35:19 i still hate going to bed early. i'm starting to think i might not outgrow it.
2011-03-11 20:42:21 "sending stories out is just so much fun, but i'd rather be outside. almost finished..."
2011-03-12 23:27:56 "i just ordered a north <propfemale> <propfemale> tree for the front yard. they only get 10 ft. tall, which is a lot better than the 30 ft. apple tree i also considered!"
2011-03-16 00:11:30 "trying to write this evening, after working all day. nearly impossible!"
2011-03-17 18:49:24 "i just woke up. we did a remerch last night and i didn't get home until 6am, but  it feels strange to be just now waking up."
2011-03-18 16:04:07 is there anything in the world that would make me actually want to revise this synopsis? <propmale> lack of motivation going on here.
2011-03-18 19:17:58 "i've gotten up from my desk three times to get something, and three times i've made it back without the thing i need."
2011-03-19 01:27:34 damn clouds.
2011-03-19 02:42:24 st. <propfirst> friends! great view of the <propfemale> now! hurry!
2011-03-19 12:55:24 estate sales this morning! plus a little junque and bike works later.
2011-03-21 15:59:48 "writing is fun, but revising is work."
2011-03-22 20:38:00 it seems to be nap time.
2011-03-23 03:02:16 "dear men: if it's a unisex bathroom, please put the seat down when you're finished. i mean, you've already touched it once, right? what's a second time going to hurt?"
2011-03-25 14:43:28 "i don't really mind the snow, but i am looking forward to visiting our friends in singapore around this time next year, where i'm sure it won't be snowing."
2011-03-26 16:34:26 "estate sales this morning, then work later."
2011-03-27 03:55:29 "this may be the prettiest snow i've ever seen, especially on the trees that had bloomed. it's like larger-than-life snow or something."
2011-03-29 15:51:27 "angry cat is sitting on my desk, staring out the window at nothing, and growling. it's only a matter of time before she attacks... my hands."
2011-03-29 16:50:46 i'm tempted by this amazon cloud android music thing... anyone signed up and using it yet? what do you think?
2011-03-29 18:55:08 "resurrecting an old, nearly forgotten story. the revisions it needs seemed impossible two years ago. today they are easy. i guess setting work aside helps."
2011-03-31 14:27:32 "i cut my finger on a can last night and the cut's not that bad, but it hurts like crazy. i can feel the pain all the way up to my elbow. actually, it would probably hurt less if i'd stop typing."
2011-03-31 18:10:32 "i don't know if this will work for everyone, but when i went to ebay, i got a notification that groupon was offering $15 of ebay credit for $7. i can't find the deal on the groupon website, so if you shop at ebay, check the ebay site today and see if it comes up."
2011-04-03 15:40:29 i love <propfemale> days and wind chimes.
2011-04-12 04:39:29 "so i've got plans to ... spend the rest of my life revising this novel i wrote, or so it seems."
2011-04-12 13:01:27 slept until 10 yesterday. up at 7 today. went to bed at the same time both nights. sleep is a mystery...
2011-04-12 20:13:24 "ha! i managed to find a hammer and a couple nails, despite <propfirst> janssen's attempts to hide the household tools from me.  smile "
