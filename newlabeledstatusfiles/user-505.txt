2010-03-02 02:51:11 "sorry to tell you all this via facebook, but it is the easiest way...the last few days have been pretty crazy and rough... my mom had a heart attack over the weekend and is currently in the icu at st. <propfirst>'s.  she is still fairly sedated, but is showing signs of life like opening her eyes and moving her arm, and the eeg she had today showed brain activity, so these are very good signs."
2010-03-07 03:01:54 "quick update on mom: she is out of icu and no longer on life support equipment.  she can't talk or eat yet, but is more alert and communicative, and is moving around a bit.  she is showing a little improvement every day, making baby steps towards recovery."
2010-03-16 01:43:37 "update on mom: she is now able to somewhat feed herself, and has been sitting in a chair during the day instead of laying in bed all the time.  she still seems pretty weak and tired all the time, but they're talking about the defibrillator surgery like it might be in the near future."
2011-02-23 01:58:50 worked out at the gym for about an hour tonight.  now i'm compensating for that by eating chili cheese fritos.
2011-03-16 01:29:12 "i don't know if it's the crummy weather or what, but i've been in a lousy mood the last couple of days... really hoping that spring finally arrives later this week."
2011-03-18 00:14:28 happy st. <propfemale>'s day!
2011-03-23 00:08:48 sick today...bleah   playful 
2010-03-25 02:01:16 "update on mom: she has been released and is at home (for now).  she has developed a fungus, and must take medication until it is out of her system (maybe 6-8 wks) before they can do the defib surgery.  so, it's nice that she's home, but it also means another couple months of waiting, and then she'll have to go back in for the surgery.   playful   she is glad to be at home though!!"
2010-05-15 00:25:22 "update on mom: the cardiac cath has been scheduled for next tuesday.  if everything looks good, i think the surgery will be the next day."
2011-01-20 01:10:41 "i think the emergen-c, chicken soup, and juice are working... i'm still congested but at least i feel better!  i just might be lucky enough to avoid a full-blown cold.   smile "
2011-01-23 22:24:42 sleep deprivation + still feeling sick = fairly lazy day today.  i see an early bedtime in my near future...
2010-11-09 00:27:03 "donated blood for the first time today!  it was easier than i thought, and i even got cookies after.   smile "
2010-11-17 04:03:17 tonight was the end of mini-medical school 1 at wash u.  i'm already looking forward to mini-med 2 in the spring!  smile 
2011-01-24 14:22:20 home sick today.   playful
