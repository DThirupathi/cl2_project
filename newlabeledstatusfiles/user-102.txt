2010-06-26 20:20:56 "it is never easy for someone to recognize they need something good in their life. what doesn't make sense is that they continue to say what they want and never realize it is right in front of their face all along.  then, when the person leaves is when they realize, it was they who they needed from the beginning.  if that person moved on, they missed their <propmale> for having that person as a blessing in their life"

2010-04-30 20:06:09 "you can buy a boat and a shiny set of skis have some fun in the sun, float around in the breeze you can lay out on a blanket by the lake drink a cold beer, polish off another day kick on back and watch the sky turn red a sunset aint a sunset til you put a girl in it."

2010-04-26 01:52:00 "we do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us, something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred to our touch. once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight of any e playful erience that reveals the human spirit."
