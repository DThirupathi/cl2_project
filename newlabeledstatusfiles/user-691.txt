2010-04-02 15:55:47 "so i'm looking for a couple of beatles songs on itunes, and there's about a thousand versions of both songs. none of the ones i've seen are actually by the beatles themselves. oh, the irony..."
2010-05-05 00:48:32 not very enthused about mr. drye leaving...
2010-05-17 22:08:54 "i'm just trying to do my best; i'm not afraid of life, i'm afraid of death... (voxtrot is amazing. just saying.)"
2010-10-29 03:00:52 let's play a lovegame.
2010-04-02 02:37:09 feels really awkward after no one understood my last status...my version of an april fool's joke that no one seemed to get.
2010-08-01 21:16:01 "i actually own a pair of sunglasses now. this is, like, my fourth pair ever.  laugh "
2010-04-16 21:01:37 i'm actually looking forward to the diversity concert tomorrow. just not the whole being-there-at-11-to-perform-at-3 smile 0 thing.
2010-04-13 21:55:50 "yesterday, my best friend slept over with me. the next morning she showed me a video of me mumbling 'the cake is a lie. the lie is a pie. the pie is a spy. the spy is <propmale> nye.' i'm not sure if i even want to know what i was dreaming about. mlia"

2010-04-19 21:26:30 "i have about 5 bruises scattered across my knees, one on my right ankle, one on the back of my head, and then one on my back. i have no idea where they came from. this worries me slightly."
2010-10-30 16:33:56 watching pokemon: mewtwo strikes back with <propfemale> willemin  laugh 
2010-04-07 19:56:15 "show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time, and turning all against the one is an <propmale> that's hard to teach."
2010-09-20 23:20:15 i hate this.
2010-04-25 19:47:19 "went shopping with the padre. it took us 30 seconds to find a solid shirt, a minute to find some black and tan hotshorts, and all of of 2 hours to find a sundress that works with what mr. drye wants. at least i've got all my costume stuff."
2010-09-20 20:02:45 "i got a double callback for hairspray--one for singing, one for dance. how did that happen?!"
2010-05-01 01:01:27 is it normal for my cactus to grow 3 inches in a week?
2010-05-22 02:19:37 "so ""repo! the genetic opera"" is officially one of my new favorite movies. i'm sure <propfemale> dance and homar ramirez are happy about that.  laugh "
2010-04-04 01:54:40 "any time you feel the pain, hey <propfirst>, refrain, don't <propfemale> the world upon your shoulder  love  in a beatles mood."

2010-04-26 22:57:18 "my cactus is growing. this excites me far more than it should, probably because this means i've owned a plant for more than 2 days without killing it."
2010-09-21 23:51:11 today wasn't so bad.
2010-09-22 11:18:11 so none of my clothes fit me right anymore. greeeeeeaaaaaat. now i feel fat in everything.
2010-09-10 23:15:49 "i really want to see ""american idiot"" now that i'm researching it..."

2010-04-18 19:23:45 "the science project is going pretty well, so i'm thinking i might not have to stay up until 5 in the morning to finish it. maybe just 4."
2010-08-14 16:35:57 learned that oreo mcflurries are really quite disgusting.
2010-09-16 02:03:12 "pretty sure i did my dance warm-up entirely wrong, but whatever."
2010-06-02 23:14:22 fifteen minutes ago it was <propfemale>. what the heck.
2010-11-13 16:30:43 braeburn apples =  love .  smile

2010-06-27 16:32:28 fanfreakingtastic. why are all of my teams losing?
2010-11-17 21:18:13 "put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was killed at hogwarts when it was under siege by the death eaters during the second wizarding war. over 50 citizens died in the terrorist attack against hogwarts. 93% of people won't repost this, but will you be part of that magical 7% that will? repost to show your support of dumbledore's army!"
2010-04-17 21:39:13 "home from the diversity concert, saw <propfemale> willemin there  laugh "
2010-10-04 23:16:24 the dalai lama has a twitter account?

2010-04-29 20:35:37 "listening to ""float on"" for the first time since the last concert. i don't despise it quite as much as i used to, but it's really weird without all my (crappy) music cuts and edits and such."
2010-05-16 20:15:50 being left to my own devices = staring at my computer as if it'll magically create something interesting for me to look at. i'm lazy today.
2010-11-01 21:05:56 "and it took me too long 'til i found out faces you know the best; oh well, i guess."
2010-05-04 01:01:30 "and in the free fall, i will realize that i'm better off when i hit the bottom."
2010-10-10 02:43:56 """what's in a name, anyway? that which we call a nose by any other name would still smell..."""
2010-08-21 19:48:00 so i'm about 99% certain that my cactus is dead or dying. fanfreakingtastic.
2010-05-11 12:16:42 dentist. ick.

2010-06-13 20:44:46 "i would just like to say, people need to quit quoting ""airplanes"" by b.o.b. it's getting seriously old. thank you."
2010-04-27 21:11:56 "earth science was rather hilarious over in the corner with homar ramirez and <propfemale> jacumin. let's hope ms. kopchick is out for the next two days, too."

2010-08-30 23:55:47 "hangin' out down the street...(finish the lyrics, people.)"
2010-10-16 17:21:30 listening to the fratellis. their music = love.
2010-06-04 21:54:19 i feel like i've left so much undone and half-finished.
2010-05-17 23:48:16 just rediscovered the first-grade joy of apples and peanut butter.  laugh 
2010-05-17 20:43:05 so the new hetalia episode brightened my day up a considerable amount.  laugh 
2010-06-06 22:25:45 "i've been playing ""<propfemale> la <propfemale>"" on repeat for the past hour. this cannot be healthy."
2010-10-22 19:57:28 "and everybody knows you well 'cept for me, can't you tell?"
2011-01-16 00:06:43 "well, today was fun.  smile "
2010-06-07 20:14:22 "one more exam, then i'm done for freshman year. it's all gone by so fast."
2010-10-21 21:46:50 "hey <propfemale> willemin, what lunch do you have?  laugh "
2010-05-06 00:25:22 so it's finally hit me that mr. drye's pretty much gone.
2010-05-29 22:14:51 "does not approve of funimation's hetalia subs. i'm sorry, but they suck."
2010-12-05 03:53:30 "you go, <propmale> coco."
2010-05-24 01:16:54 i am lost without you here; i am only living out a lie...

2010-05-07 00:59:30 "is too exhausted to think of anything else to say but, ""i'm exhausted."""
2010-06-12 00:14:30 3 days in and i already hate summer.
2011-01-25 23:37:03 "once, i wanted to be the greatest..."
2010-05-27 02:50:22 "oh my god funimation is dubbing hetalia. i don't know whether or not this is good, but if vic micwhatever dubs <propfemale> i will kill someone."
2010-06-02 11:46:21 i am officially the stupidest person on the face of the planet. you cannot fathom the depths of my lack of intelligence.
2010-05-09 02:24:41 i would just like to extend my deepest thanks and eternal gratitude towards the utter genius who invented makeup remover.
2010-05-28 02:15:33 "is most definitely not doing homework right now, and most definitely needs to be."
2010-06-15 02:18:39 "sorry, mom, but if my first time behind the wheel was at 10 at night i don't think i'd be doing too spectacularly. (she tried to get me to drive, i didn't want to, and we spent 5 minutes arguing/laughing about it...disaster safely averted.)"
2010-07-19 19:20:36 asdfghjkl; i just found rhps on netflix. my day has successfully been made.  laugh

2010-05-21 00:54:38 has the feeling that there's something that's been forgotten. probably homework.
2010-06-17 21:15:45 i think the person/people who made the powerthirst video were high at the time. there's no other way that could have come into existence.
2010-05-29 19:17:41 why has funimation rated hetalia as tv-ma?!?!?!
2010-05-26 23:31:04 "i just had the time of my life on ustream with <propfirst> and <propfemale> from parlÃ© productions. <propfemale> jacumin, you missed sooooo much."
2010-05-14 23:26:38 what am i doing?
2010-07-24 01:00:47 i have a feeling this live-action fairly oddparents movie is going to ruin my childhood.
2010-07-27 00:07:13 quit telling me to use the friend finder.
2010-05-31 21:05:08 "is anyone else having issues finding info about sonni <propmale> for their lineage paper, or is it just me?"
2010-05-15 17:39:03 "someone needs to find a cure for allergies, because i can't take this any more. die, allergies, die."
2010-05-14 00:21:22 so tomato sandwiches are officially my favorite food.
2011-02-03 00:49:06 "urgent: i need a solid-color, floor-length (or just long) prom-type dress by tomorrow. anyone my size have one i could use for the show?"

2010-06-05 20:13:22 "just read a summary of the hetalia movie. does anyone know how to raise enough money to buy a plane ticket to japan and a few movie tickets within, say, 3 days?"
2010-06-15 15:26:17 "dude. <propmale> <propmale> is old. seriously. i mean, i knew he wasn't exactly young, but i mean, he looks really old in this commercial."
2011-02-07 04:21:56 this hurricane's chasing us all underground.
2010-06-17 17:14:23 "can't stop listening to <propfemale>'s eurovision 2010 song, and why must i read ""3 cups of tea""???? and why does this year's world history summer reading sound so much cooler than what i had to read? this is unfair."
2010-05-30 04:54:22 "i want to cover my bedroom walls in whiteboards, mirrors, and clocks."
2010-06-24 18:48:53 the vuvuzela thing on the youtube videos is hilarious.

2010-06-05 15:07:27 "well, facebook, there's quite a bit on my mind right now and it won't all fit into this little box. thanks for asking, though."
2011-02-09 03:08:54 "you're waiting for a train that will take you far away. you know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't be sure...yet it doesn't matter. now, tell me why?"
2010-09-25 18:49:43 "oh my god, if i don't get a shower soon i will die."
2010-07-02 19:31:07 "got in the car and turned on the radio just as ""audience of one"" came on. my day was successfully made.  smile "

2010-09-10 12:00:07 "thanks for all the birthday wishes, everyone!  laugh "
2010-07-30 06:01:01 this screwed-up sleeping schedule of mine is going to become very painful once school starts.
2010-08-29 22:49:27 "just found out <propfirst> o'brien plays phineas & ferb's dad. can we get a close up, riff?"
2010-05-26 20:46:29 "lesson of the day: always check to make sure that the headphones you're using for an <propmale> project do not work better than the ones you're using now, before you hot-glue them to the cardboard.  annoyed  will mrs. pentecost give me extra points for my sculpture doubling as a speaker?"
2010-06-15 14:22:21 i feel like i have a thousand things to do today.
2010-08-02 00:47:08 the one horrible thing about this hacked internet connection is that it screws up my aim. dx

2010-06-29 04:37:47 "you never realize just how easily scared you get at 12 smile 0 until you have a mini centipede somehow get onto your head then fall onto your arm, without you knowing, and then you look to scratch and there's this black wriggly thing on your elbow and you have no idea where it came from."

2010-08-15 16:13:27 seriously tempted to become a pastafarian.  laugh 
2010-11-11 22:47:14 the fact that our digital copy of <propmale> potter & the half-blood <propmale> (that we didn't know about until 10 seconds ago) e playful ired really irks me. b(

2011-01-24 00:54:39 "after taking into account the fact that it took me 15 minutes to locate my phone, all i can say is: i am certainly not a hufflepuff."
2010-11-12 01:03:01 like my status & i'll do nothing about it.  smile 
2010-10-20 23:46:21 "please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity. stupidity is real and should be taken seriously. you could be sitting next to a sufferer right now. there is still no known cure for stupidity and sympathy does not help. we can raise awareness. 97% of people wonâ€™t copy and paste this, because they donâ€™t know how to copy and paste."
2010-11-12 23:12:13 the hardest part is letting go of your dreams.
2010-10-22 01:11:10 om nom nom.  smile 
2011-01-05 22:35:32 "i've been listening to lady gaga a lot recently. feel free to psychoanalyze me.(is that even a verb?)"
2010-12-15 20:50:59 "whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark."
2010-12-08 02:00:28 "english writing ""benchmark,"" then the civics benchmark right after that, then dance, then a spanish test. all in one day. and that day happens to be tomorrow. oh crap."
2010-12-09 00:51:36 my plan for the downtime during the show: choreograph my duet. it's a flawless plan.

2010-10-17 03:07:09 that concert was so much better than thursday's.
2010-11-23 20:53:47 "think i've found a message in a bottle; it says, ""drink me, drown your sorrows."""
2011-01-18 00:12:31 "long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned."
2010-11-15 02:08:37 "anybody wanna ask me something in my inbox? i shall answer it as a status. (yes, for once, i'm doing one of these stupid things...i have the feeling that i'll regret it.)"
2011-01-30 23:57:59 the past & present don't matter now that the future's sorted out.

2010-12-13 01:46:24 "we're plastic, but we still have fun."
2011-01-09 23:21:38 <propfemale> weasley makes <propmale> <propmale> eat his vegetables.
2010-11-21 19:35:38 "so <propmale> fiennes has played voldemort, hades, and a nazi. typecasting much?"

2010-12-11 16:25:02 "i do not approve of this new facebook. and the show last night was pretty great; if you want to attend tonight, it's 7 p.m. in the cata theater. tickets are $8. hope to see you there!"
2010-12-04 18:21:41 "don't look up, just let them think there's no place else you'd rather be."
2010-12-13 20:56:11 "and the last-chance girl in a first-dance world lays her head down on the wooden floor, won't be dancing any more."
2011-01-10 16:12:06 i want someone to play in the snow with...
2010-11-28 21:23:02 these urban legends about pokÃ©mon game hacks are gonna give me nightmares.
2010-12-16 20:58:57 "all we are are pretty faces, picture-perfect bottled rage."

2010-11-12 01:19:26 """i don't hate you, canada! hate is a strong word! i hate turkey!"" <propfirst> mousetrap veenstra  smile "
2010-11-19 07:47:24 so <propmale> & i spent about half of that movie sobbing on each others' shoulders. go see it now.
2010-11-15 02:17:39 "<propfemale> ciel owens : because i keep forgetting that we've moved to skype, and because you're evil. <propfemale> jacumin: are you sure you're not talking about yourself?"
2010-12-14 22:26:04 i'm perpetually cold nowadays.
2010-11-20 01:57:54 pandora internet radio + indie singer/songwriter channel = a very happy (but still ill-feeling) <propfemale>.  smile 
2011-02-08 01:47:16 "if only, if only..."

2010-12-04 04:25:05 but i'll only ever be a middle-distance runner.
2011-01-19 00:32:18 "kinda wish that i'd gone out for made, but having cameras follow me everywhere and document my life would make me go absolutely off-the-wall crazy."
2011-02-09 21:27:15 not really excited for this httyd sequel. can't disney just let an amazing movie be amazing without squeezing as much cash out of it as possible?
2010-12-24 05:09:51 "history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme."
2011-01-16 20:48:41 and i can't seem to shake this awful feeling.
2010-12-19 04:34:04 "according to time magazine, ""the man your man could smell like"" is the best commercial of 2010. good choice, time, good choice."
2011-02-01 02:27:17 am i really that fragile?
2010-12-12 04:18:30 i left my head and my heart on the dance floor.
2011-01-26 04:10:46 "why on earth would you create a horrible, autotuned remix of the ""ponyo"" theme song?! it's an abomination!"
2011-01-29 19:31:01 my legend begins in the twelfth century...
2011-01-21 21:50:12 and who knows why the love you need will always pass you by?
2010-12-30 02:30:47 because i'll only ever be a middle-distance runner.
2011-01-23 19:38:09 i hate football.
2011-02-11 00:46:45 "ponyo, ponyo, ponyo, fishy in the sea, <propfemale> little fishy, who could you really be?  smile "
2010-12-28 23:19:56 well...
2011-01-03 03:12:51 "just spent an entire itunes giftcard on httyd. it was well worth it, though.  laugh "

2011-02-08 03:12:22 did anyone know that the white stripes broke up 5 days ago?
2011-02-02 13:26:28 tell me that this house is not a graveyard.
2011-01-21 00:01:56 there's nothing else i can say.
2011-01-11 22:00:42 asdfghjkl; no school again. what is this. whyyyyyyy.
2011-01-29 23:14:19 "oh yes, they both reached for the gun, for the gun."
2010-12-31 23:11:03 "so basically, if i want to be a dance/movement therapist, i have a choice of 6 schools, none of which are in nc. oh well."
2011-02-04 21:38:29 first show tonight. let's make it big!
2011-01-26 21:38:03 om nom nom.
2010-02-17 23:06:09 "if you're bored, then you can ask me a question or tell me something. http annoyed /www.formspring.me/museftw"
2010-03-17 20:31:26 how can i blame you when it's me i can't forgive?
2010-03-08 21:45:01 "<propmale> from where you are, i lay down on the cold ground and i, i pray that something picks me up and sets me down in your warm arms..."
