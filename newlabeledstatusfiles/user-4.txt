2011-03-31 17:31:25 "the world is a scary place. a lot of scary things can happen. you should know, though, that you will always have someone there for you. this makes things much less scary. but when there are two people scared, should they not have each other?"
2011-03-31 17:31:31 "it becomes only that much more terrifying when one chooses the aid of another and leaves the other in the dark. do not let yourself become this person. if you and someone else are facing a situation, be each others strength. do not make the other face fear alone."
