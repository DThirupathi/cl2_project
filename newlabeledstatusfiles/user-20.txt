2009-08-29 18:46:34 "this scene is a fake, this scene is a fake, the world will cry out at the mess we will make. the smiles mask an unforging truth. the laughs cover a wide spreading lie. and we all look away because we want to forget. we'll all look away, we'll all look away."
2009-08-30 00:35:33 "my heart beat is totally going to the beat of this song i'm listening to, it's pretty awesome"

2009-09-04 03:25:09 the power to bring me out of solitude - or to push me back into it - had never belonged to another person. it was mine and only mine.

2009-08-30 03:45:22 "out of twenty-five levels only one person has ever made above level twenty. i am sad to say that there will probably never be a person allowed over level twenty again. this will be done because i no longer wish to let people gain so much power. this may not solve the problem, but it keeps other problems from arrising. that is all."

2009-11-26 21:01:47 is watching spongebob the movie  smile 
2009-11-27 06:47:11 it's funny how sometimes even the closest of people can completely disappear from the face of the planet if you take the time to let go and see if they'll hold on. i guess that's just how things have got to be.
2009-12-05 04:16:44 what a dayyy.

2009-11-29 06:06:26 "has become more and more weary of people. if friendships stopped being so based on convinience, most people wouldn't have very many friends left at all. i suppose that's just the way of things though."
2009-12-07 05:38:37 "and if i had the <propmale>, even the slightest opportunity, to change it all and start all over, i wouldn't do it. i would turn and walk away because i know that even if i start over, i'll make the same choices, because those choices, good or bad, were the ones that led me to you."
2009-11-11 00:10:11 "they will see us waving from such great heights, ""come down now,"" they'll say. but everything looks perfect from far away, ""come down now,"" but we'll stayyyy."

2009-08-24 21:28:17 "well, the day went well. i have a few awkward classes, but that'll change once i get to know people."
2010-01-25 07:21:07 "the few times that i decide to finish things, i decide that i won't put anything down until i finish them. tonight, i probably won't be sleeping. i'll be painting instead."
2010-01-07 21:36:15 racism is idiotic and immature. don't blame people that don't look like you or come from where you came from for problems that everyone has to face.
2010-01-26 04:43:20 "if you've had a rough day, look at the sky for comfort. imagine that all of the stars and the beautiful <propfemale> are there to reassure you. to reassure you that there is more light to come. even on the darkest night, a few stars will find their way out of the blackness, and shine, as magnificent and as brilliant as ever before, and they will shout to you, ""there is hope"" and they will sing ""there will always be hope."""
2010-01-25 05:17:30 "all you need is love, love is all you need."
2010-01-25 22:57:29 "i'd run around the world and back, i'd swim across the ocean blue, i'd float up into infinity, if it meant getting to see you. i'd catch a hundred fireflies, i'd train the sun to shine so bright, i'd reach for a thousand stars, if it meant you get to feel alright."

2010-02-01 04:52:18 "hello 2010, i'm glad i've been doing a really good job at starting new. i'm sure you appreciate all of my false effort."
2010-02-04 05:51:25 "anyone who looks past today and takes glimpses of tomorrow is unrealistic. tomorrow is a string of endless opportunities and chances while the past is unchangeable and real. finding comfort in the future is difficult, the fear of what could be lurks in all of us. but the past, no matter what has been dumped into it, will never change."
2010-01-12 06:45:13 "take my hand and i'll show you what it's like to live. we'll travel to the <propfemale> and we'll gaze at all the stars. we'll float on nice and slow until we land on mars, where i'll remind you what it's like to laugh and what it's like to smile. i'll steal you away from here for just a little while."
2010-02-05 04:24:34 "is it sensible to look to the future for hope, when a few years ago we were looking at today and hoping the same."
2010-01-26 00:12:09 "i'd give you everything, but i've got nothing left."
2010-01-13 04:06:02 "today may have felt like the longest day in your life, and maybe it dragged on and took forever to end, but you'll look back in a few months and think, where in the world did all of my time go? we don't have forever, so we might as well appreciate what we've got."
2010-02-06 22:30:51 "i've got my sister's old mp3 on shuffle, and next thing i know, the theme song for hercules comes up. i'm sure my day just got a wee bit better."
2010-01-13 04:46:49 "i want to open your eyes. i want to show you what you've created with all of your lies. and even if it takes me a thousand and one tries, maybe some day things won't have to be this way. maybe some day you'll listen to what i've got to say."
2010-02-08 05:54:19 "it's not just about surviving anymore. it's about making that survival worthwhile. if all we did was live and die, who'd want to put effort into staying alive?"
2010-02-02 05:47:03 "i once had a pet rock that really liked to sleep in my sock. i told him to stay, but he still went away, i don't know how he could walk."
2010-02-09 06:12:49 "sometimes, if you take the time to look into its eyes, you'll realize that the monster that you've been trying to run away from for so long seems to look just like you."
2009-10-30 03:25:52 "i don't like the taste of tea anymore. sad day. i hope everyone's had an incredible day, and if you haven't, then i really hope that tomorrow can be much better. remember that it'll always end up being alright. tomorrow's a brand new day, let's all try to make it a good one  smile "

2010-02-14 17:39:50 for those of you who participated in the reading of <propmale>'s inferno and thought it was awesome- get the game.
2010-02-13 07:14:27 what's so great about caring anyway? i guess i can spend the rest of my life trying to figure that one out.
2010-02-11 04:49:17 """this is <propfemale>, we speak english."" hello hypocrisy, racism, and stupidity, it's nice to meet you. i'm sure freedom of speech has its upside somewhere."

2010-02-12 05:54:45 """you came to our country. you learn our language"" it's good to know that there's hope for this country. land of opportunity? haha more like land of ignorance."
2010-02-22 23:42:44 i plead insanity
2010-02-22 00:56:56 "what do i think? i think if a man kills another, he deserves to die. i think that killing someone out of hate makes you a monster, and you should be treated as such. what am i writing my essay about? why capital punishment is wrong."
2009-11-19 22:17:29 "i cannot stand rude people, i cannot stand them not at all. i cannot stand rude people, it makes me want to hurl in a highschool hall. i cannot stand spanish teachers, who talk like they're so cool. i cannot stand chemistry teachers, who act like complete fools."
2010-02-06 06:43:16 "imagine everything you've ever feared; everything that's ever hurt you in the form of a monster so insatiable and hungry, that you've got to feed it your own happiness for it to be okay. that's not what life should be about. life is about finding your monsters and conquering them, not about living in fear and hiding from them behind clouds of smoke and the haze of a good drink. don't let your monsters hold you back."
2010-02-23 01:45:11 """there's nothing cool about being young, when the monsters of the night have stolen the sun."""
2010-02-24 04:45:05 let's set ourselves up for failure. i've heard the fall is quite a thrill.
2010-02-25 03:52:13 "i've got to admit, sometimes, i can't help but be greatful of the luck i have."
2010-02-28 03:37:59 "it's always gonna be so much easier to let go and fly, than to hold on to everything you've got left."
2010-02-21 00:24:49 nastiest thing ever- i just laughed so hard i puked.  laugh 
2009-11-23 04:31:17 "sometimes i get to wondering, what life would be like if we could just hold on to everything we had, and never have to worry about it slipping away."
2010-02-28 19:41:04 "we close our eyes nice and tight. we listen to the words that make us feel all right. we hear the symphony of lies, the tune that helps us sleep at night."
2009-11-25 06:52:31 italian is such a beautiful language.
2010-02-23 03:48:26 where does all the time go?
2010-03-09 03:28:48 attacking the cake lady who kidnapped the muffin man is my favorite past time.
2010-03-08 06:19:15 "what are we gonna do if all we ever have our minds on is surviving? not live, that's for sure."
2010-02-18 02:11:51 "well if the sun just ain't shinin bright enough for you, and if the dim starlight's just makin you blue; if the shadows have got you tight by the neck, and you're nothing but a sorry and sad wreck, well if you're hurtin and aching and it just won't go away, i promise that no matter how sad or down you are, i will always be here to stay."
2010-03-16 04:18:23 it's silly how a bunch of accidents make us who we are.
2010-03-02 04:14:39 i'm beginning to think that maybe we've got it all wrong.
2009-12-29 23:58:24 "i'm going to go lay down in some rainbow colored snow, and melt into the atmosphere and let myself go. i'll meet the sun up in the sky, and ask him why in the world he doesn't want to shine right now, and ask why he won't even try. he'll sing me a little song, and tell me that he's tired, so i'll let him take a nap, as i ride a bike around the clouds and hope it won't be long."
2010-03-01 23:21:47 "my lips sewed shut, my eyes closed tight, my hands pressed hard against my ears. i've got nothing to see and nothing to hear, but while i sit in darkness, i've got the world to fear."
2009-12-24 06:07:11 there's a funny taste in my mouth. it must be the taste of happiness! yes. that's it.
2010-03-10 05:55:59 i wish i could dig into the mind of the usual person. see what it's like have a brain that functions as most others do. i wonder then if i'd consider myself much more brain wrong than i do now.
2010-03-14 02:29:19 children these days make me realize where the world is going. it's a little sad really.
2010-03-15 04:06:33 anyone wanna tell me what's so special about spring break? i think people sounded more excited for this week off than christmas break.
2010-01-08 05:17:43 "in my country, football means soccer. sooo, i don't like any footballll  laugh  you stupid americans you  wink "
2010-03-18 03:22:12 "dear world, i've changed."

2010-03-12 04:11:00 "life loves throwin stuff out there for us, i guess it's smart to start learnin what's worth catching and what's not."
2010-01-22 04:36:05 "for the longest time i thought i'd lost the best of me, but i'd be damned if i quit now and that's for sure."
2010-02-14 01:30:08 up = most adorable movie ever made on the face of this planet.
2010-02-19 04:34:54 "hello life, my name is <propfemale>, and i think you've just about met your biggest disappointment yet."
2010-10-03 06:32:30 you have to be willing to lose it all in order to have anything at all in the first place.
2010-07-12 02:55:09 "summer is pointless, so is school, yet growing up is as well. guess i'm screwed."
2010-04-05 00:25:04 "well, this was an extremely successful weekend. i've accomplished.. wait, nevermind, i haven't accomplished anything, when do i ever."

2010-03-30 02:28:47 you gotta know what you're up against in order to fight back.
2010-03-31 02:43:40 sometimes i wonder if i'm going to remember all of this when i've grown old.

2010-04-01 05:14:18 "i might as well forget everything, maybe i'd get a fresh start. it's too bad that even then i'd probably make the same mistakes."
2010-03-24 04:49:12 there's no pain like that of being lost in what's supposed to be the most recognizable place.
