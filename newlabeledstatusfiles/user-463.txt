so this class is called cognition and memory and seems to be laughing at my lack of both  for once in a long time i'm actually terrified of a test 
"""always the padawan, never the jedi"" -<propmale>"
"is human  with the end of the semester nearing, and my ever-absent brain working against me, i am succumbing to stress, doubts, and anger   i fell off the coffee bandwagon today  i would like to thank my favorite roommate for putting up with my &%$# lately   he deserves an award or something   "
had an awesome dayyy! i got the roommate outside in the sun and we saw water for elephants!! awesome movie!
"""what? they're not coming to something that has no men and no booze? that is shocking!"""
"i get ready for work this morning, and my roommate is not here  i come home from work and he's not here  i guess the relief is that i don't like this  sad  good news is  i'm ready for my nap   "
"tired  and not sure if i'm working tomorrow or not   1 class down, 2 to go  not thinking about those at the moment! sun, come out tomorrow  pleaseee"
looking at school work at the other job while things are slow  reading about wwii and all i see in my head is inglorious basterds   
"figured out how to make baby girl move today  smile  i worried about not feeling her before, and now she's keeping me up all night  going to bed, and if anyone tries to contact me before noon tomorrow  there will be blood "
"""your friends love you  if i knew nothing else of you, that would be enough """
i've discovered the worgen class of wow   productivity today is shot   this one actually has storyline!! and it's like a little england! best of both worlds? i think so  we'll leave out any comparisons to twilight  
"you can tell a lot about people by who they surround themselves with, but ppl still act surprised when they ""discover"" who ppl really are  if it's always new people, they probably don't care too much for deep relationships   if it's all party-people, they're not gonna chill with you  i'm scared because    i'm surrounded by anti-social people  what does that tell you?"
really motivated to work out  smile  the bremerton y has cycling classes and women-only weight classes that'll help me ease into working out 4-5 days a week and at my own preggo-pace!!
taking <propmale> to the y in bremerton for a toddler class while i go work out! it's been a while  it's a little scary
io sono perso di nuovo   
"going back to work out  my legs are protesting from yesterday, and i'm still sickish, but <propmale>'s excited for the construction class! who knew exercise support would come from the 5 yr old  "
got over feeling lousy by going to the gym then going out for coffee and some bare-necessities grocery shopping   though it felt more productive  i still have the urge to just go to bed and cover myself up and shut out everything  fortunately the child does not allow for this kind of emo tendency  and i slept over 10 hours last night 
"not understand what my issue was with indifference  it's so easy to get things done when you're indifferent to everyone else  the emotionally-suppressed may be on to something  i'll channel it long enough to finish the next week of school, then go back to having feelings  "
"maybe it's finals this upcoming week, or cold i've had the last few days, or the pain in my arms and legs from working out, or my stomach feeling like it's stretched over night or my demanding bladder, but i hate life right now  i don't care how stupid that sounds  the worst part of it is feeling like if i get up early enough i can get coffee before work, like that'll fix everything   a girl's gotta have something "
two finals due may 6th and i'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel   ! there goes this week   
" love  sweet like <propfemale> to my soul   sweet you rock and sweet you roll   lost for you, i'm so lost for you  love "
i guess it's good to still miss someone after a year  smile  working less and him working more is just strange  and now i have no excuse to miss the gym  
doesn't remember when she settled for the responsibilities of marriage minus the dress-up party   i'm protesting  starting with the kitchen!
sometimes people don't find answers because they don't want to know   but knowing you don't want to know isn't so different from knowing is it?
"if anyone knows anyone with manic bi-polar disorder and wouldn't mind answering some silly questions i have for my book, please message me  i don't need to know who the person is and it will be kept private unless you e playful ress otherwise  i do not need any more information on narcissism  i'm all caught up  "
taking <propmale> to a tumble bears class and going running  hoping to shake off this gray
"it shouldn't be so hard to find someone that values you as much as you value them, in friends or lovers  on the other hand, how would movies and books sell it otherwise? no one likes reading about something easily obtained in real life  "
"loves that cinco de mayo is an excuse for people to drink  as if those people -need- an excuse  it's also thursday, which could be reason enough for some people   where is the excuse not to drink? yeah  i'm pregnant, and working on my finals   and still caffiene-free  i miss my addiction of choice  "
 love  24 weeks  love  it seems to be going faster  finals being finished tomorrow will be one less thing to slow down time!
writing my psych thesis on motivations of love and lust in a relationship and i realize   my son can read really well now  it's a sad day when you can't keep your kids in the dark anymore!! one more day of school  i'm counting the hours 
"""the night is always darkest before <propfemale>""  melodramatic maybe but  it fit today with these *&^% papers   finals are funny because it's this final squeeze on you before releasing you to adult life in time for summer "
"finishing my psych paper on love & lust only to be reminded how dull psychologists are when referring to romantics   i'm not sure if they're talking about humans or animals  instead of 'the one' or 'love making"" we have ""human pair bonds"" and ""mate copulation""  there's a reason i'm interested in literature and not science  "
"for mothers day  got my profile pic of my grandma and my mom  missing my family in oregon  and my red hair   that was about a year ago   !!  happy (early) mother's day to all of you  family, hope to see you soon!"
 love  had the best roommate ever  love 
fact: 6 out of 7 dwarves are not happy   
mothers day gift? sleeping   which is what i did yesterday after work  and probably what i'll do tomorrow after work as well  my habits are becoming awful  but  no school!
"   <propmale>'s been up sick since 4, which makes me wonder after i made him eat last night  annoyed  last two days of work were busy, braxton hicks galor, and now i've had little sleep and i'm ready to hurt somebody  and grades still aren't posted   sleep, why do you elude me   and kid "
"feels better!! the fix? dishes while watching smoking aces 2  followed by my best friend's wedding songs on youtube   i didn't say it made sense! still waiting for kid to get some sleep  don't know that it'll happen soon, but either way, i get to work tomorrow!"
