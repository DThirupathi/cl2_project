2009-10-13 03:53:46 "dwight: <propfemale> is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. if she eats something the fetus doesn't like, she is screwed. it's amazing: a three ounce fetus, is calling the shots! it's so bad ass."
2009-09-28 06:50:49 wishes things came to her in dreams instead of life e playful eriences. inspiration doesn't need to have such long lasting effects.
2009-10-09 01:25:38 "listen up cuz i love ya lady - we go back like 1980 - you know you the one that changed me - you love me cuz im so crazy - you'll see, it'll be, you and me, someday"

2009-10-28 06:56:23 """well, i mean, there's this little hole. it was kind of an aesthetic choice by the architect. and if you shoot a laser into this hole, the station blows up."""
2009-10-09 00:59:31 anyone wanna see zombieland or inglorious basterds tonight?? i'm so behind...
2009-10-29 04:58:43 "true blood marathon - yes, history homework - yes, pot of coffee goin - heck yes. sleep = overrated"

2010-03-20 01:01:44 "doesn't know why she lets ex's statements bother her, particularly when their maturity was questioned in the last place. and you know what they say about women scorned...and common courtesy isn't common (yay murphy!)"
2010-11-12 04:23:58 thinks people need to surround themselves with more support and positivity. at least as much as you give. don't confuse familiarity with friendship. it's time to cut out that that brings you down. even if it means starting over.?
2010-03-22 19:43:01 that's the plan. rule the world. you and me. anyday  wink 
2010-04-05 03:21:27 "<propfemale> my phone hates me..it's not sending my texts and is cutting my calls short. that being said, i'll be home tomorrow, yay! i'll say i'm happy about it..."
2010-04-05 04:49:54 found a local writers group. woohoo! hopefully i'll meet some ppl with semi-similar interests. maybe make a few friends i can keep! or maybe i'll acquire a new stalker..that seems more likely.
2010-07-01 14:29:36 sooo sleepppyyy..no sound in the world parallels the horror that the alarm brings..
2010-10-01 04:17:40 ? i left my baby on the side of the highway...?
2011-01-28 06:04:42 "is having a mini crisis of priorities, wants, needs, loves, hates, random emotions, and the downside of procrastination/play-now work-later. it doesn't help that i have to work tomorrow and i'm just now feeling awake.."

2011-01-29 07:30:05 """every shadow no matter how deep is threatened by morning light. """
2010-04-21 06:46:49 attended my first writer's meeting!! it's amazing how work inspires me to write..reading inspires me to write...home inspires me to write..all while takign away my actual writing time..
2010-11-14 01:34:11 is accruing a detoxing team..we can do it!!
2010-08-19 07:09:07 "thanks cookie for an amazing weekend, as usual...though the point was for me to make you food..not bring a lot of kck ass food over..not that i'm complaiing. <propfemale> bride ftw...my gd bf is doing dishes...wtf"

2010-04-10 03:26:42 finally got her ass moving. i did the first step of biggest loser's cardio something..one of the therapists at work uses this and it looks good for her..but my legs are jelly and my butt is twitching..not to mention i haven't sweat like this in quite some time..sitting on my ass is catching up with me!! but yayyy day 1!
2010-04-12 15:39:07 "has never been opposed to going to church..i sin, as much as anyone else and i'm on the road to improvement, tho moving slowly. it is the people i know who consistently go to church that makes it look like a bad idea. to me it is blasphemy to go to church when you have no intention of trying to improve. it would seem better to not go at all then to go for the sake of improving you image while still ignoring god."
2010-04-25 03:24:32 actually got a lot done at work today...i battled/organized the leg rests with only minor bruises!! now im being entertained by <propmale>'s nephew wyatte. <propfemale> cleaned the apartment..almost didn't recognize it. saturday night in..yayyy...
2010-04-26 05:01:40 "watching the young <propfemale>. my love life is missing at best, so why not live vicariously..so much better than that paper on terrorism i'm supposed to be doing for history."

2011-02-08 22:33:37 "i realllyyy really hate facebook sometimes. i've never wanted to delete something and never look at it again so badly. and at the same time, if i didn't have facebook, i don't know that i'd talk to anyone.."
2010-06-28 15:57:13 packed yesterday so that today is 'clean the apartment' day....yay...
2010-04-27 20:45:27 mondays are sad and near hopeless...plus no one ever wants to do anything on mondays. ..ugh. lottery...please find me.
2010-05-08 08:01:48 stupid sleep..creeping up on me when i'm not e playful ecting you and then refusing to show when ive the time...i wish i didn't need you. but it would suck to be an insomniac. really starting to see how writers get to drinking..
2010-06-17 10:46:34 "wonders how days can go from so messy to so good to so messy..i had a good day, regardless  smile "

2010-04-18 19:23:34 finished a small place and the narrative of the life of <propmale> <propmale> in time to write papers on them! it's funny that reading makes me want to write so badly but in reading i utilize my writing time  sad 
2011-02-09 04:43:41  love  working on book during band practice. not too shabby  smile    love 
2010-04-19 04:16:31 "hates homework for taking away my small semblance of a social life...ok, if we're being real, it's cutting into my movie watching/fan fiction writing time..but that doesn't sound nearly as cool."
2010-05-02 23:19:13 """i ask myself everytime i go to do something, 'would an idiot do this?' if the answer is 'yes', i do not do that thing."""

2010-04-05 00:10:53 """my feets is tired but my soul is rested"" doing history homework..but the quote, i can relate. it's funny how doing the right things and avoiding easy escapes/distractions can make things a little bit harder in life..still hoping it'll pay off in the end. if not, i did what i could."
2010-07-18 08:36:39 "is a happy girl...i got a notebook to write in (with button-cover to save it from the far recesses of my purse..) and a shitload of reeses.  plus i got to see my best friends (sans <propfemale>..), eat too much food and see most of a movie. i will have to see inception again and stay awake...thank you guys for making today better"
2010-05-27 01:40:51 there was not enough chocolate in the facility today to distract me from work...and poppyseed cookies are not cookies! grr...

2010-04-28 03:38:09 "stop looking at me, swan!!"

2010-05-04 02:06:27 is done thinking until next fall. about to watch slammin salmon with the roomies and hopefully play wow...thinking is overrated. i want mindlessness for a little while. ugh...i can't believe i finished that chocolate red wine..there is too much of a good thing..and two of my favorite things should not be combined..
2010-05-03 19:40:34 almost done with classes...now praying my slacking isn't going to cost me.  i need to socialize today..classes make me angry
2010-03-31 00:57:34 doesn't get people..how can you e playful ect so much from everyone and throw a fit when you don't get it but make no effort to show the simplest consideration to anyone? am i going crazy here? feared as much..
2010-05-05 00:34:07 is moving forward..the past'll kill ya if you stay in it. and history doesn't always have to repeat itself. sometimes you have to keep the light switch on even if you don't like what you see.
2010-04-13 06:45:00 """rather bear those ills we had, than to fly to others, that we know not of"""
2010-07-10 00:23:05 "...one of those days...thank you co workers for being such an awesome team..thank you <propfemale> for the very necessary coffee (the start, anyway) and <propfemale> for the amazing chocolate.  reeses cake = epic win. with all that amazingness..why do i still feel so bummed  sad "
2010-05-06 00:43:42 wants to be able to use poetry and such...i a lot of times i get a lot of inspiration for my book but it's never in sequence with where i'm at in the book. maybe  because i'm at the beginning. again. ugh. third time's a charm...

2010-11-30 07:54:03 is at her wit's end with school and work and life in general. i can only put so much stress and effort into something not knowing if it's going to work out well or not. a more profitable <propmale> might have been a wiser choice.?

2011-01-19 06:53:53 "is unmarried. i apologize for all the stress it must bring on your conscious. i will settle with god when it is my time to do so. unfortunately, despite your white slate (i am assuming it is white, if you are drawing notice to my sin yourself) i will not settle with you, and owe no e playful lanation. despite your view, i am happy and my relationship is more solid than any that could be achieved by a patched-up wedding."
2011-02-06 05:01:25 "what...rape is not rape anymore!?? i'm so confused!! of all things, is this really something to pick apart now?"

2011-01-19 09:40:45 "the waiting game is fun. the more time you put in it, the more stubborn you are to stay until something happens, because otherwise you've just wasted a lot of time. but you're still wasting time and nothing's happened. so what're you waiting for? because you feel it could come at any minute. keep waiting..."
2011-01-21 22:40:34 "has a fever, and nothing's staying down. this feels more like the first time..i've googled some stuff but does anyone know what's safe to take while preggo??"

2011-01-03 02:37:45 ...going to extremes has met a new ridiculous level. glad someone got what i was actually referring to and didn't take one part of it that had little to do with it as the whole problem...that would be stupid.
2011-02-13 21:08:59 "had so much fun at forza last night watching torre!! thank you brookelyn spicer, <propfemale> luce, <propfemale> dimof, <propfemale> <propmale> durnal, and my usual friends and others for making the night awesome!"

2011-02-06 05:46:23 so...teddy <propmale> was kind of a dbag. and a <propmale> racist. kind of hurts the whole <propmale> bear image.
2011-01-23 02:23:56 "soo..stomach in full recovery, showing <propmale> how to make chocolate covered strawberries turned in to us eat chocolate covered strawberries.."
2011-01-31 07:48:47 finished my psych 470 paper on the motivations of eating/unhealthy eating while eating a heaping bowl of top ramen. mmm....
2011-02-04 07:02:31 anyone wanna see the goo goo dolls on march 5th?
2011-02-11 15:42:34 "thought the little dude was finally feeling better. or that i'd be able to talk today. neither is entirely true, but there is some silver lining in cuddling and watching <propmale> & <propfirst> way too early in the morning.."
2011-02-07 05:51:01 communication is underrated. you can learn a lot by voicing things and realizing people aren't guessing your thoughts. but where's the mystery in that?  smile 
2011-02-06 23:12:44 "?i think i know what's on your mind, a couple words, a great divide. waiting in the wings, a small respite, crawling out the foreground from behind.even though you're the only one i see, it's the last catastrophe.place your bets on <propmale> and apathy.?"
2011-02-16 07:11:59 "what's love without confidence? certainty cheapens faith, and uncertainty renders it too costly an endeavor.  to quote dwight: ""i feel like part of what i'm being paid for here is my loyalty. but if there were somewhere else that valued loyalty more highly, i'm going wherever they value loyalty the most."""
2011-02-16 08:51:00 """girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up. every movie we see, every story we're told implores us to wait for it, the third act twist, the une playful ected declaration of love, the exception to the rule. but sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending we don't learn how to read the signs."""
2011-02-16 19:14:53 just finished water for elephants..wow. studying just looks awful now.
2011-02-17 18:25:51 i tried!!
2011-02-17 21:10:27 "made the mistake of going on etsy...bad idea. i now own a super cute maxi dress. still..bad idea."
2011-02-18 06:32:38 was mortified to find one of my more snug pairs of pants will not button...why!?? this is too soon!!
2011-02-18 19:30:40 called out today because of kid and ended up feeling sick instead. karma...or baby. i'll be a peach to work with tomorrow though..more or less. i'd like to point out that what i have is wrecking me but is not contagious. unless you work at northwoods lodge. or are associated with torre/sound parade. yeah...
2011-02-19 00:55:41 "??why do you sing to everybody but me? i just sit back and watch.you are the daydream in my eyes, there whenever i wake upbut the colors never crystallize and i never get enough??"
2011-02-20 06:16:23 "13 weeks. my bump jumped out from nowhere. and these cramps i keep getting are my belly stretching apparently..it's a beautiful thing.  and...i ate skyler's ice cream. i should feel bad."
2011-02-20 19:00:51 "my belly feels like i was beaten with baseball bats and dont remember it. at least i know i'm not (too) crazy, <propfemale> mentioned whatever it's called. internal beating or something like that...good news is tylenol wasn't on the list of coping mechanisms taken from me!!"
2011-02-21 16:56:30 isn't used to being productive this early..i'm at a loss for what to do right now. i know what <propfirst> would do...maybe i should do that.
2011-02-22 00:37:20 "making meatloaf, mash potatoes and broccoli (<propmale>'s fav)!!!  excited to start cooking more."
2011-02-22 04:14:57 "doesn't get it!! i get so much done at work! but between homework before 10 am, grocery shopping, lunch/dinner, and cleaning the kitchen..it's 8 surprise 0!!! where did today go?? why did my cookies deflate!?? whose dirty dishes snuck on the counter!!escaping reality...i'm playing wow..."
2011-02-23 22:53:07 "is home with 3 kids, soon to be 4, and is super excited to get the dishes done without a hitch! slacking with the cooking tonight in leiu of yummy chili!!i need to get out of the house soon..i'm becoming one of those those facebook people...and i got some cute bump-savvy dresses..."
2011-02-24 17:00:27 "first ""doctors"" appt!! finally!! excited for baby stasi.  then dressing up just because and dragging my favorite boys out for some day-fun.  i smell coffee..."
2011-02-24 19:41:43 "found out lots of stuff..more importantly, we'll have our ultrasound between 16-18 weeks, so between march 12-march 26th we'll know our baby girl is a baby girl!! yayyy!! i can't wait to see her!!"
2011-02-24 23:08:00 suggested a movie night in with dessert for a date night..stephen suggested deer <propmale> because i haven't seen it..must be love! lol

2011-02-28 04:13:57 "inspirational evening at newlife with <propfirst>, his mom and sister..followed by garlic chicken...yummmm. evening spoiler: procrastinated assignments.  cure? girl scout ice cream."
2011-02-28 18:12:40 "going to the bar tonight! wait..that's not me. top gear party? no... a yummy raspberry mocha and my leather writing journal at global bean tonight?? that was me a year ago, but old habits die hard  smile and...open mic night!! come visit your favorite local starving artists!! buy them wine and they'll dance for you! pretty sure.."
2011-03-01 22:29:23 uh..it's really creepy that now facebook guesses who'se who when you go to tag..and is usually right..pretty funny though when they think a woman is one of your guy friends..
2011-03-02 19:35:34 "thinks it won't be so hard to lose my mind one day when i can be ignorant to the fact i lost it..being fully aware of losing your mind is very frustrating, when you realize your folly and your brother is giving you that look that says ""you lost yo *&$^ mind."" and no amount of tears will make you feel any smarter.in unrelated news..i do still have the coffee creamer i bought yesterday..."
2011-03-02 20:53:01 "?? and i never wanted anything from you, except everything you had and what was left after that too. happiness hit her like a bullet in the head. struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that. ??"
2011-03-04 04:06:13 sold goo goo dolls tickets via craigslist just to find a crib and graco to buy with the money...
2011-03-05 02:14:03 "people never fail to shock or surprise me  annoyed  i am blessed to know several people that, despite a lacking facade, know right from wrong and don't pretend."
2011-03-06 19:19:18 thank you everyone who came to the show last night!! and held out afterward to see our <propfirst> and amara!! a special thanks to <propfemale> masch for stoppin in on her birthday!  smile  hope you feel better lady!!

2011-03-09 01:28:22 "totally felt baby girl today..i don't care what the book says!! it was awesome!! now she won't come back...probably had to do with me rubbin her.  i was excited.. i feel like <propfemale> on the office ""i saw it! i saw it! i saw it, and it was awesome! did <propmale> say i didn't see it? i saw it!"""
2011-03-09 02:02:58 "?? all for freedom and for pleasure, nothing ever lasts forever, everybody wants to rule the world ??"
2011-03-09 16:41:25 "isn't looking forward to my proctored test, but i am grateful that i can wake up with my kiddo, enjoy a yummy cup of coffee, and know today is going to be pretty awesome. after my test.."
2011-03-10 02:57:43 "seems like everyone and their sister is pregnant right now..glad i can be trendy for once! i don't frequent bars, i don't stay out til 2 am like most people my age seem to do, never tried drugs, but i can be pregnant and love that!  smile "
2011-03-10 03:55:14 "whole grain spaghetti, turkey meatballs and vodka sauce...so glad baby is letting me eat today!! i won't mention how many boxes of girl scout cookies i have stashed in my room.."
2011-03-10 21:25:55 "you really see the power of god when you realize how easily he forgives, and how hard it is for man to do the same. our past shapes us into who we are today, but somethings are harder to get over than others, particularly in the land of facebook, when our past can follow us whether we like it or not.. got to love it..."
2011-03-12 01:26:48 "is a little late, but i'm giving up facebook for lent. which is funny..because it's the source of everyone gabbing about what they're giving up and all..but god knows how much time i waste on facebook..and since i'm late i'll extend a few days passed easter to make the full 40.  every time i think about getting on, i'll think of how to better enrich my relationship with god. so..i'll be doing it more!!"
2011-04-01 05:33:41 "...ewww...the transient downstairs is making awful noises..i've never been prone to gagging based on a noise before."
2011-04-01 18:00:16 kid is sick...again..the other night he freaks me out by waking me up after he got a bloody nose (it was like a scorcese movie..) and he hasn't even been around anyone whose been sick the past few weeks!! why!? poor guy is holding his tummy and saying it hurts.  i'm going to see if people will let me work sat/sun so i don't keep missing but...why does everyone keep getting sick!?
2011-04-01 21:38:25 "kid still is icky, i'm tired and my nose won't stop running, and baby is making all food look like poison.  crazy-painting-guy says i look stoned..haha. i am blessed to have so many good days to make this one seem less-than-stellar."
2011-04-01 22:20:48 "one of god's challenges for me is anger. i've gotten better. jesus washed the feet of he who betrayed him. i do have trouble with those who wrong the ones i love more than those who've wronged me. i just can't get rid of that urge to punch that person in the face and then, i could forgive them...that's not right is it...maybe its the hormones.."
2011-04-03 05:16:17 "feeling like you're found only to realize you're more lost than you were originally..is probably worse than feeling lost. but now, i'm just lost.."
2011-04-03 18:20:12 "finals are coming! i can see the light on the other side, but it's more like indiana jones, where the door is slowly closing on it. i can't wait to be done.."

2011-04-07 02:12:46 "is having an off day..not bad, or awful, but off. but home is where to fix that..now how to fix what i did to my hair..spoiler alert: getting your hair changed is only a pick-me-up if done right!"

2011-04-08 05:09:14 is looking into the case <propfemale> program at oc..anyone know about this? it's only 19 credits so i could take a class here or there in addition to wsu and it would put me in a slightly psychological field.
2011-04-08 08:29:08 "had to be at the library at 10 am to look at a newspaper from the depression for my 5 <propfemale> paper, but i'm still up doing stuff for one of my psych classes. it'll all be over soon!!!"
2011-04-08 20:28:30 is going crazy with final projects..but i'm super excited about the silverdale ymca!! it'll open when i'm all done with classes!!
2011-04-08 23:58:28 is really saddened by our court system. it seems like the laws and lines put in place to protect abuse from the system now translates to people getting off free for nearly everything.
2011-04-09 02:05:16 "as many times as i seem to find faults..when i see how awful people can be and when i remember my own past ventures, i am extremely grateful to have someone to love who is just plain amazing  smile  and without sounding overly confident, i'm glad he has me too!"
2011-04-09 03:19:18 "my hair is white. hoping to fix this soon, with the help of a roommate.  hopefully the result will not be even worse. i'm not opposed to wigs. or i will just fix it again."
2011-04-09 05:16:52 "finished my big history project!! on time!! and now i'm going to play wow because it's friday, <propmale>'s at his dads house, and i'm just wild and crazy like that!!"
2011-04-10 07:48:25 "it's funny how god brings you to where you need to be, but not exactly in the way you'd think. while my road isn't without regret, i can't say that things didn't turn out perfectly.  there were a lot of things i needed separated from long enough to realize what they were doing to me, and people i needed to be around long enough to realize a good thing when i saw one."

2011-04-12 17:56:39 day #2 of detox..starting to miss coffee..hoping the whole headache/ickiness doesn't accompany today!
2011-04-13 02:46:26 can't hear the x-files theme song without a shudder and involuntary flashbacks..so...stephen made it his cell phone ring. this is filled out to completion with a drawn out sigh of defeat.
2011-04-13 04:49:41 "it shouldn't be this hard!! i want ice cream, i want cheese, i want a bagel, i want a freakin baked potato...it's funny that coffee isn't even that important. cheese/ice cream are the front runners.  day 2 almost done..and health doesn't come easily!"
2011-04-13 19:24:35 hope comes from une playful ected places..
2011-04-13 20:45:06 taking the kiddos to the park..they're great distractions from all my food issues!!
2011-04-14 01:27:34 "just finished the blind assassin by <propfemale> atwood..i love that woman..she's dark, crazy, and wickedly talented. i really thought i guessed what happened this time, and i was so wrong. got to love it! i'm convinced that you have to be crazy to write really, really well!"
2011-04-14 17:54:13 day 4: feeling a little better. reached a good calorie count by adding evoo and avocados (and almonds!). still having a hard time drinking all the water with my little passenger.
2011-04-15 05:04:29 is extremely shocked and saddened to find that you can't even order girl scout cookies online..why!?
2011-04-15 23:29:13 """look at her standing there will those yams. my two greatest enemies, <propmale>. <propfemale> green and complex carbohydrates."""
2011-04-16 01:26:02 uploaded some of the pics i took at nwl on <propfirst>'s last day!! we'll miss you  annoyed 
2011-04-16 03:06:42 at starbucks..getting my studying on. i realized if i want to spend more money for a mfa in creative writing i have to get good grades..
2011-04-16 07:33:50 "?? and mother always told me be careful who you love, be careful what you do, cuz the lie becomes the truth ??"
2011-04-17 05:52:46 day six of no coffee..i'm still alive!
2011-04-18 02:42:29 """satisfaction is the death of <propfemale>"""
2011-04-18 05:40:13 "people have a way of letting you know exactly how important you are to them. and to ignore this is to create problems for yourself. everything's clear in hindsight. keep excusing their behavior and e playful ecting a different result, see how far you go."
2011-04-18 19:36:27 "finished my detox! i was a little concerned because i lost 6 lbs, but i was taking in around 2000 calories a day (and eating all day) and i was only drinking water.  but i'm at my pre-pregnancy weight at 21 weeks  annoyed  this week i'm bringing back dairy/wheat so baby can have her fat!"
2011-04-18 22:00:50 such a beautiful <propfemale> day for a baby to be born  laugh 
2011-04-19 06:28:15 just got back from the hospital  smile  <propfemale> and jaron have such a cute baby!! and nine pounds! wooo!
2011-04-19 20:09:47 made grilled avocado and brown rice with tilipia for lunch while <propmale> was chasing <propfirst> around while lawnmowing because it's just super cool. <propmale> kept bringing me flowers. he was so excited about it i didn't have the heart to tell him they were weeds...
2011-04-20 03:21:41 "you know..it's funny, because i like twilight. i really do. but at the same time, it breaks my heart to see good actors join the upcoming cast. because the movies..yeah..they're not so good."
2011-04-20 05:05:04 i get on <propmale> about procrastination all day..and here i am staring at my history paper..thinking of what else i might do instead.
2011-04-21 02:41:12 grateful to have adult roommates  smile  well..mostly... there seems to be a constant stream of newspapers that leave a trail to <propmale>'s room. but if that's our only problem we're doing good!
2011-04-21 04:01:00 water for elephants comes out on friday..i am already thinking of who i'm going to coerce into going with me. i don't have many willing participants.
2011-04-21 18:33:24 "it's almost noon, but i keep falling asleep! <propmale> kept getting up early on and baby waits til i'm laying down to start kicking!! it's too soon..."
2011-04-22 06:46:09 should be sleeping..but i was off and on all day..silly sleep cycles. world of warcraft ftw!
2011-04-22 18:14:34 school does not appreciate good friday. putting my final for cognition due by the end of today? not so good. but i'll appreciate it anyhow. jesus made a much bigger sacrifice!
2011-04-23 01:46:50 so this class is called cognition and memory and seems to be laughing at my lack of both..for once in a long time i'm actually terrified of a test.
2011-04-23 03:02:51 """always the padawan, never the jedi"" -<propmale>"
2011-04-23 04:59:17 "is human. with the end of the semester nearing, and my ever-absent brain working against me, i am succumbing to stress, doubts, and anger.  i fell off the coffee bandwagon today. i would like to thank my favorite roommate for putting up with my &%$# lately.  he deserves an award or something..."
2011-04-24 05:25:02 had an awesome dayyy! i got the roommate outside in the sun and we saw water for elephants!! awesome movie!
2011-04-24 06:23:58 """what? they're not coming to something that has no men and no booze? that is shocking!"""
2011-04-25 00:04:49 "i get ready for work this morning, and my roommate is not here. i come home from work and he's not here. i guess the relief is that i don't like this  sad  good news is..i'm ready for my nap..."
2011-04-25 07:56:04 "tired..and not sure if i'm working tomorrow or not.  1 class down, 2 to go. not thinking about those at the moment! sun, come out tomorrow..pleaseee"
2011-04-25 23:34:51 looking at school work at the other job while things are slow..reading about wwii and all i see in my head is inglorious basterds...
2011-04-26 03:47:19 "figured out how to make baby girl move today  smile  i worried about not feeling her before, and now she's keeping me up all night..going to bed, and if anyone tries to contact me before noon tomorrow..there will be blood."
2011-04-26 19:50:23 """your friends love you. if i knew nothing else of you, that would be enough."""
2011-04-26 21:40:28 i've discovered the worgen class of wow...productivity today is shot.. this one actually has storyline!! and it's like a little england! best of both worlds? i think so. we'll leave out any comparisons to twilight..
2011-04-27 00:51:04 "you can tell a lot about people by who they surround themselves with, but ppl still act surprised when they ""discover"" who ppl really are..if it's always new people, they probably don't care too much for deep relationships.  if it's all party-people, they're not gonna chill with you. i'm scared because... i'm surrounded by anti-social people..what does that tell you?"
2011-04-27 22:14:16 really motivated to work out  smile  the bremerton y has cycling classes and women-only weight classes that'll help me ease into working out 4-5 days a week and at my own preggo-pace!!
2011-04-28 17:43:05 taking <propmale> to the y in bremerton for a toddler class while i go work out! it's been a while..it's a little scary
2011-04-29 05:03:24 io sono perso di nuovo...
2011-04-29 17:30:39 "going back to work out..my legs are protesting from yesterday, and i'm still sickish, but <propmale>'s excited for the construction class! who knew exercise support would come from the 5 yr old.."
2011-04-29 23:27:44 got over feeling lousy by going to the gym then going out for coffee and some bare-necessities grocery shopping.  though it felt more productive..i still have the urge to just go to bed and cover myself up and shut out everything. fortunately the child does not allow for this kind of emo tendency. and i slept over 10 hours last night.
2011-04-30 03:22:33 "not understand what my issue was with indifference. it's so easy to get things done when you're indifferent to everyone else. the emotionally-suppressed may be on to something. i'll channel it long enough to finish the next week of school, then go back to having feelings.."
2011-04-30 06:07:29 "maybe it's finals this upcoming week, or cold i've had the last few days, or the pain in my arms and legs from working out, or my stomach feeling like it's stretched over night or my demanding bladder, but i hate life right now. i don't care how stupid that sounds. the worst part of it is feeling like if i get up early enough i can get coffee before work, like that'll fix everything...a girl's gotta have something."
2011-05-02 18:23:55 two finals due may 6th and i'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel...! there goes this week...
2011-05-03 06:56:59 " love  sweet like <propfemale> to my soul...sweet you rock and sweet you roll...lost for you, i'm so lost for you  love "
2011-05-03 15:48:42 i guess it's good to still miss someone after a year  smile  working less and him working more is just strange. and now i have no excuse to miss the gym..
2011-05-04 00:28:17 doesn't remember when she settled for the responsibilities of marriage minus the dress-up party.  i'm protesting. starting with the kitchen!
2011-05-04 01:41:55 sometimes people don't find answers because they don't want to know.. but knowing you don't want to know isn't so different from knowing is it?
2011-05-04 02:12:08 "if anyone knows anyone with manic bi-polar disorder and wouldn't mind answering some silly questions i have for my book, please message me. i don't need to know who the person is and it will be kept private unless you e playful ress otherwise. i do not need any more information on narcissism. i'm all caught up.."
2011-05-04 17:38:13 taking <propmale> to a tumble bears class and going running..hoping to shake off this gray
2011-05-04 20:00:33 "it shouldn't be so hard to find someone that values you as much as you value them, in friends or lovers. on the other hand, how would movies and books sell it otherwise? no one likes reading about something easily obtained in real life.."
2011-05-05 18:21:03 "loves that cinco de mayo is an excuse for people to drink..as if those people -need- an excuse..it's also thursday, which could be reason enough for some people.. where is the excuse not to drink? yeah..i'm pregnant, and working on my finals.. and still caffiene-free. i miss my addiction of choice.."
2011-05-06 02:24:17  love  24 weeks  love  it seems to be going faster..finals being finished tomorrow will be one less thing to slow down time!
2011-05-06 05:48:06 writing my psych thesis on motivations of love and lust in a relationship and i realize...my son can read really well now. it's a sad day when you can't keep your kids in the dark anymore!! one more day of school..i'm counting the hours.
2011-05-06 19:19:55 """the night is always darkest before <propfemale>"". melodramatic maybe but..it fit today with these *&^% papers.  finals are funny because it's this final squeeze on you before releasing you to adult life in time for summer."
2011-05-06 22:33:05 "finishing my psych paper on love & lust only to be reminded how dull psychologists are when referring to romantics.  i'm not sure if they're talking about humans or animals. instead of 'the one' or 'love making"" we have ""human pair bonds"" and ""mate copulation"". there's a reason i'm interested in literature and not science.."
2011-05-08 01:34:47 "for mothers day..got my profile pic of my grandma and my mom. missing my family in oregon..and my red hair.  that was about a year ago...!!  happy (early) mother's day to all of you..family, hope to see you soon!"
2011-05-08 04:51:44  love  had the best roommate ever  love 
2011-05-08 08:00:38 fact: 6 out of 7 dwarves are not happy...
2011-05-09 04:26:40 mothers day gift? sleeping...which is what i did yesterday after work..and probably what i'll do tomorrow after work as well..my habits are becoming awful..but..no school!
2011-05-09 16:50:47 "...<propmale>'s been up sick since 4, which makes me wonder after i made him eat last night  annoyed  last two days of work were busy, braxton hicks galor, and now i've had little sleep and i'm ready to hurt somebody. and grades still aren't posted.. sleep, why do you elude me.. and kid."
2011-05-09 22:22:39 "feels better!! the fix? dishes while watching smoking aces 2..followed by my best friend's wedding songs on youtube...i didn't say it made sense! still waiting for kid to get some sleep..don't know that it'll happen soon, but either way, i get to work tomorrow!"
