amnesia is a scary game. i've never played it but when <propfirst> plays he turns off the lights and puts his headphones on....which makes the room reeeaaally dark and eerily quiet. i'm pretty sure sitting in the room not playing the game is way scarier than actually playing the game!!! lol
fallout 3 just glitched on me. i was trying to take a boat ride on an invisible ferry that was built up of big red triangles with exclamation points. i finally swam to where the bed was (lol) and clicked on it but then the game crashed.
