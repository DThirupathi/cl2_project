2010-08-02 19:47:02 "the thought that some people are able to describe people as ""undesirable,"" like the conservative party does in v for vendetta, is disgusting. everyone deserves love and respect from their peers. but then again i suppose the idea of people being undesirable, is the same concept as god sending his/her children to hell. they are both disgusting, and poor ways of thinking. ...sorry. just ranting again."
2010-07-04 15:42:07 "every inch of me shall perish. every inch, but one. [integrity.] an inch. it is small and it is fragile and it is the only thing in the world worth having. we must never lose it or give it away. we must never let [the government] take it from us. ...i hope that the worlds turns, and that things get better. -<propfemale>"
2010-04-23 00:25:24 the right strikes again. i just heard that the tea is trying to remove anything that they find liberal in history textbooks; starting with the political and philosophical views of our forefathers. there are supposed to be over 100 changes made. ...so much for recieving an education. thanks texas. -_-
