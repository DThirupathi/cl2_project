2009-08-22 04:25:00 <propmale> and hobbes: <propmale>: it's not denial. i'm just very selective about the reality i accept. t.t  i wish i exercised this latent human ability more often.
2009-08-22 04:29:31 "<propfemale> (my little sister who's pestering me): if reality is false, and everything false is not reality, then what is it i ask you? the answer, of course, is tortellini!"
2009-08-28 01:52:36 just learned that the cheerios <propfemale> has lied to her - by exclusion - thousands of times. (mla)
