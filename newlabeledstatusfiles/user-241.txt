had the funnest day today!  swimming and joyland all in one day!
fall is in the air!
climbed a tree 
yay!  <propmale> finally said he's excited for school!
"why, to the north pole, of course!  this is the polar e playful ress!"
i guess i was bothering <propfemale> too much while she was coloring - she grabbed a book off the desk and told me to go read!
i love that my daughter turned down a cookie for what?  a second helping of tomato soup!
"had a surprise visitor this morning: a monarch butterfly huddled up to my door step!  we let him warm up in the house for a minute, and then sent him on his way!"
yay for <propmale>!  zero cavities!
a turkey big enough to feed everyone: $20; time spent shampooing the living room carpet: 2 hours; having your family over for thanksgiving: priceless!
"i'm disappointed that everyone will not be able to come for thanksgiving, but i'm still very excited to see everyone who can!  if anybody needs a place to go for thanksgiving, we'll have plenty of turkey!"
what is it about styrofoam that cracks little kids up?
<propfemale> christmas!
"had a really awesome thanksgiving!  i'm really glad everyone could make it, and i hope they all get home safely!  i hope everyone else had a great thanksgiving, too!"
happy new year!
and the <propmale> elementary december student of the month is     <propmale>!
"<propmale> has his first spelling test on friday!  the words: bat, cat, and rat!"
"it's time to show the world that more of us support our troops than don't! if you support our troops then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour!!! and if you don't stand behind our troops, then please feel free to stand in front of them!!"
it's amazing how independent my 2-year-old becomes when she has a friend over!
i'm getting kinda worried about kindergarten!  homework and reading tests?  boy has it changed since i was there!
"i turned on pbs for <propfemale>, and what was on?  a song about poop! yay!!"

it's amazing how a day-trip can really recharge your batteries!  for the first time in a long time i wasn't completely exhausted at bedtime and tired when i woke up!  it's great!

"in celebration of <propfirst>'s day, post a picture of you and your significant other as your profile pic for the next week  if you have one, post a wedding pic  post this as a status update and leave a comment stating how long you've beentogether!??"
"i just love it when a trip to the local park turns into a day at the pphm, palo duro canyon and the big texan!"
"today's fb game - place of birth! everyone please play! you will find it interesting to know where your fb friends birth places are  copy & paste this on your profile, then put your place of birth at the end of this sentence: <propmale>, utah"
"does anyone have any suggestions about how to get a 2 year old to stop grinding their teeth in their sleep?  it can't be for her, and it hurts me to hear it!"
what happened to spring?

"we just got back from our first camping trip, where <propmale> lost his first tooth!  we had so much fun, and the tooth <propfemale> was even able to find our tent to get <propmale>'s tooth!"
"one dentist appointment down, one to go!  yay for no cavities for <propfemale>!"
"well i guess it's a <propfemale> birthday party for <propfemale>!  we told if she was potty trained by her birthday she could have one, and she's only had one accident in 4 days!"

i just love how babies march when they walk!
"we had a great barbeque for <propfirst>' birthday today!  lots of yummy food (thanks to lj for cooking the meat for us!), lots of friends, and lots of fun!"

i think i need to go to <propfirst>'s club and buy kleenex in bulk!  how does so much snot come out of people so little?
"<propfemale> was sitting in the kitchen watching me make lunch when i heard her say ""hey mom!""   i answered her and then she said ""(to herself)oh, <propfemale> on a second! (to me) momma, could you please be quiet?  i'm talking to my mom on the phone  (to herself again) sorry about that   """
