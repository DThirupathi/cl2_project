2009-10-27 19:43:06 "he tried to take away all the things that would let you love me without being in my bed, like a friend or a father. this has everything to do with him. this is about knowing the difference between right and wrong, between the truth and a lie. he took that from you. and if you can't tell the difference, then you can't trust anyone. and if you can't trust, you can't love. - <propfemale> rule"
2009-10-07 02:58:37 "ohhhh i feel like i've messed up again in some sort of way, and its back to not talking much and awkward situations, i wish things could be one way or another not the constant up and downs!"

2010-09-27 09:50:50 "even when i'm sick i'm a trooper, i still get up make plans and go on like nothing is different. i've changed my mind, i'm going to lay around all day, sleep,relax and have me time, and if someone doesn't like it too bad it's my sick day."
