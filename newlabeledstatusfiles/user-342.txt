2011-02-24 22:26:19 the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair.

2011-02-28 03:42:13 "i know 2 adresses here in the valley and you, google maps, are wrong. i know what's at that adress and it is definitely not what i'm looking for."
2011-02-28 18:00:25 waking up in phoenix feels like the first few minutes after being hit by a truck.
2011-02-28 20:08:59 "yeah, i'm at a baseball game"

2011-03-03 05:28:27 some people are happy to be home from a long trip i can officially count myself among those who are not.

2011-03-04 05:10:22 """i'm the man and everbody out there knows that i'm the baddest""-hu4l"

2011-03-08 19:14:42 yep i'm awake. don't know why. but i am
2011-03-10 05:26:27 lost in stereo
2011-01-30 22:07:09 when all you can do is make it from today to tomorrow making it to tomorrow is the hardest thing you can do.
2010-10-10 03:02:58 where am i and who are you?
2011-03-12 05:58:04 "wanted to put something fitting but honestly i think lost in stereo pretty much covers it. so, lost in stereo."
2010-10-22 22:15:04 """you built a time machine out of a delorean?"""
2011-03-12 07:30:48 you only get one shot...
2011-03-14 08:00:46 i feel like a monster. the good kind that is.
2011-03-15 01:27:17 o sht y'all i think they forgot about dre!
2011-03-16 01:24:13 "honestly, what is the worst that could happen?"
2011-03-17 06:53:15 i can't lie; i'm feeling a little bit country.
2011-03-17 22:51:13 it ain't nothing but a g thang baby
2011-03-18 04:37:50 while perfection may very well be a goal that is well beyond the reach of any human that doesn't mean that i'm not going to strive to achieve it in every way. you show me a person that is 100% content with every aspect of their life and i'll show you a person that will never know true happiness.
2010-12-21 19:43:03 sum beach...
