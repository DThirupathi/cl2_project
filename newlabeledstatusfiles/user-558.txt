2010-01-24 17:10:54 manning back for another super bowl
2010-01-28 00:47:52 do geese see god?
2010-02-03 00:36:29 "i will say this about tarentino: he has the best ear in hollywood for music, sound effx, and sound editing. so, what the hell, people? what am i missing that everyone else seems to see?"
2010-01-29 00:46:18 "ah, satan sees <propfemale>..."
2010-01-31 09:09:45 "worst actor on lost: whoever sawyer is in real life. i mean, how over the top can you get?"
2010-02-03 00:31:49 "you are entitled to my own opinion: to bookface, cc: movie enthusiasts everywhere: what is it world? why do i seem to be the only one who doesn't see what is good about tarentino's new film, inglorious basterds? i went into the movie very interested. first scene: awesomely depicted tension, great acting. the rest of the movie: stupid, messy crap."
2010-02-03 00:39:28 "and now... getting my drink on, getting my lost on"
2010-02-03 00:33:04 "first of all, why does the subplot take total control of the movie?? it's entitled ib, yet the basterds boast a total of twenty minutes saved from the cutting floor. and half of them are missing in between cut-aways. so, we're led to believe half of them died... might've been cool to watch, rather than the looooong, boring scenes following blonde cinema owner and irritating socially unaware nazi sniper."
2010-02-03 00:35:31 "and the blonde cinema lady bent on revenge, falling for the bad-guy-playing-possum? even in the forties, this was a cliche! and what the hell is up with killing hitler?? that's like slapping the faces of every jew and gypsy family that suffered the holocaust; it cheapens the reality of what happened, borderline mocks it."
2010-02-06 11:25:26 i'll find it before i float around the tip of their tongue
2010-02-04 23:40:06 "so i finally watched the movie witness for the first time, where <propmale> ford hides as an amish man. as many of you know my past w/ the amish, you should not be surprised to hear i was disappointed that they, the amish, were portrayed in a positive light. when will we get the balls to make a movie that shows them in their actual radiance:"
2010-01-28 18:35:27 you know the worst part of any state of the union address? the fact that this is a democracy and we have to wait for every opinionated heel-nipper to stop clapping before a sentence gets finished. i've said it before: democracy... simply doesn't work.
2010-01-31 13:21:35 "imagine that, stan: karate jesus!"
2010-02-07 23:45:48 "there's no room for cursing in a civilized world. unless, brenden, unless u know how to do it right. it's called creative use of words. it's like poetry, like <propfirst> frost: stopping by the woods, on a snowy fuckin evenin. that kinda shit."
2010-02-03 19:00:49 satan oscillate my metallic sonatas
2010-02-10 07:02:24 "can someone please tell me why bookface is playing us off one another by having us answer questions that are either obscene, ill-humoroed, or just downright mean? and to what ends? so we can find out who else is answering questions about us that is none of their business? the whole interaction seems to acheive nothing but the further spreading of narcissism."
2010-01-24 13:59:45 "okay, so i finally have bookface. it is only because certain people continuously pester me to create an account. if you ask me to be your neighbor for some stupid-ass game, i will probably not only say no but laugh at you because you obviously dont me. so live it up, those of you who know to whom i am speaking, you broke my impressive wall built against the technological ages."
2010-02-03 00:35:40 "every ""suspenseful"" scene, e.g. basement tavern, french cafe cream scene, etc., is entirely too drawn out and ridiculous. what happened to the clever hilarious dialogue and shifts in e playful ectation that we've come to accept from pulp fiction, res. dogs, hell, even the kill <propmale> movies?"
2010-02-10 00:48:53 "anyone interested in seeing a new movie, but can't decide what's worth watching, i suggest a serious man by the coen brothers. hilarious."
2010-02-04 23:40:13 "making their sons smoke at the age of 12 (and that's not ""machine-rolled cigarettes, english), standing right next to the target while their friend sights in his single-shot rifle, their lack of hygeine, spiteful disregard for property lines, neglecting american laws that dont suit them while taking advantage of ones that do...."
2010-01-30 07:19:13 "okay, least favorite character on lost: <propfemale>. what a dumb ho. if there were to be a picture next to the exemplar of why good intentions aren't always a good thing, you'd see her dumb ass."

2010-06-25 23:00:46 "the culmination of my week of working shades of green: money that my boss forgot to file w/ payroll, 50 hours' practice to be one of those buckingham palace guards that never move, and read the first 3 books of the torah. how absurd is leviticus?? anyone?"
