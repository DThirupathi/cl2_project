"i loved you the minute i knew i was pregnant. i loved you the minute you were born. then i saw your face & fell in love some more. you were only a minute old but i knew i would die for you, & to this day i still would. when you choose to have a child, you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk outside of your body. put this on ur status if u have children u love more than life."
so very bored. just been loungin around all day. nothing to do. taking a lazy day i guess.
thnkng bout saying fu*k the dishes and doing my 48 <propfemale> burn and firm pilates workout to release some aggression. ...hmm yup thnk i better.

"please copy and paste this into your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone, who needs a punch in the face. people who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many. there is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face except a punch in the...face. 93% of people won't repost this.... why? because they probably need a punch in the face!"
"?i've carried a child within my body, ive slept with them on my chest, been puked and peed on, spent sleepless nights in a rocking chair, i will kiss boo boos and mend broken hearts, but i wouldnt have it any otherway, my body isnt magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see...a mom, and there isnt any greater honor or blessing!! make this your status if your proud to be a mom?"
o m g ! had so much fun last night!
"do i work? yes! i work 24 hours a day. why? because i'm a mommy. i am a cook, a cleaner, a parent, a teacher, a referee, a nanny, a nurse, a snot rag, a jungle gym, a pony, a handyman, a maid, a security officer and a comforter. i don't get holidays, sick-pay, or a day off. i work through the day and the night. i am on call at all hours. now tell me my job isn't a real one! re-post if you are a mommy"
so very very sore from working out last night... never asssume your in shape even when you work out all the time hahaha
"put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a bears fan. being a bears fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously. there is no known cure for bfd, and sympathy does not help but we can raise awareness. 100% of packers fans will repost this, simply because we know how to copy and paste.....woooohooo!!!!"

"if you have a wonderful man, who helps balance your whole world, who isn't perfect but is perfect for you. who works hard and would do anything for you. who makes you laugh and drives you crazy, who is your best friend, who you want to grow old with and who you are thankful for every day and who you could not live without. brag about him a little and re-post this as your status."

i have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please post this as his/her status for 1 hour. think of the ones you know or love who have or had cancer. my wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found. will you post it for 1 hour? do it for all. there are too many to mention who have fought and who are fighting. i hope to see this in all my friends' statuses.
