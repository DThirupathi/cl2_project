is now holding auditions for his entourage.
has a show to rock and can no longer afford to fraternize with the likes of you.
you mortals bore me. i shall return later!

"if i had a dollar for every time a chick was tryna get at me....speaking of which, can i borrow some money?.......what?"

101.3! funk station for the funk nation! so the petrified can become fotified in funk! funk it!
if that nigga lil <propmale> is featured on one more song i swear.......
so very tired....
...learning songs late at night....this is turning into a trend that i don't like!
word word-check it check it-cha-ooh ooh-hold up hold up!
so a guy walks into a bar.....that's it......well if you wanna know so badly you ask him what happened next!!!
life is actually nothing like a box of chocolates. it's more like playing 'frogger'.
seeing the future seems like it would clear up a lot of stress & uncertainty...but on the other hand...if you knew everything was gonna happen before it happened you'd eventually get bored.
i really hate early rehearsals!
sometimes.......i just don't want to......
can't have your cake and eat it too? if i have or own a cake you can be damn sure i'm eating it......provided that i'm in the mood for cake.
is <propmale> <propfirst> and the mic is my excalibur!
the fro-hawk is in full effect!!!
"roscoes in chino hills tonight: good times, good stuff."
"a,b,c,d,e....g...p....x,n...q....ugh....just forget it."
....so...tired...
i feel like i need a vacation....and things are just getting started....
"""i'll be there"" to ""beat it""! <propfirst> yelled. ""<propmale>"", scared to death screamed, just just ""leave me alone!"""
excellent tactic! attack when unprovoked! i must remember that.
i plan on seeing district 9 tonight. anyone wanna come along?

it's an odd feeling to know you were meant to do something but still have doubts.

"life is like a box of chocolates...if i'd known how much of a stank b@*%h you were gonna be, i wouldn't have bought you a damn thing!"
