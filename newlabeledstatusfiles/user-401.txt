2010-05-11 01:59:07 you should die first then live in an old home. get kicked out when youâ€™re too young get a gold watch & go to work. work 40 years until youâ€™re young enough to enjoy your retirement. do drugs alcohol party & get ready for high school. go to grade school become a kid play have no responsibilities. become a baby go back into the womb spend your last nine months floating & finish off as an orgasm. -<propfirst> carlin
2010-09-02 02:35:01 "what the french, toast?! my brain is on overload... i need very long stay-cation. one where i don't have to work, spend a lot of money, don't have to pack, do laundry, dishes, homework... i need a break from it all. three days ain't gonna cut it... but i'll give it a try.  wink "
2010-05-27 11:56:37 "you know you're in trouble when you're havin one of those mornings, running late because of it, and that means no time for any coffee that i could possibly choke down to get the day off to a better start... : /"

2010-11-10 20:40:24 "...loves watching my dog run into things like glass doors or more obvious things like walls. i can only imagine that when i have kids some day, i'll have 24/7 entertainment and i'll laugh harder than i have today."

2011-01-03 20:18:14 "i don't ever want to wish my time away, but i really just need to skip to february to save my sanity."
2011-01-10 15:05:26 i get this evil enjoyment out of watching people spin of the road unconscionably. it's like nascar on ice. lol. btw i'd like to thank mr. <propfirst> <propmale> for not letting me be one of those people and letting me borrow his truck. love you!

2010-12-24 17:20:17 for the first time in my life i have wrapped absolutely none of my presents and now i have to cram before i go into work at 3.  playful  ...and i'd rather just lay here in bed all afternoon with my baby <propmale> who's currently curled in a little ball between me and my laptop. thats what i think about that.
2011-02-01 18:37:28 "snowed in, still not feeling good, not to mention starving but my stomach is turning at the thought of food.... so a little <propmale>, <propmale> & <propfirst>, and fresca will hopefully do the trick. (his choice of course.)"
2011-01-28 01:24:51 mmm my lips are a minty lavender. guess i found the <propmale>'s <propfemale>'s that made it through the washer.
2011-01-08 18:53:29 "what to do, what to do, what to do.... hmmm......  playful "
2011-02-27 21:54:59 "apparently i'm not the only one who is ready for a change in season. spring can't get here soon enough... although, the hail hitting the windows makes me wonder how much more body damage my poor car can take."
2011-03-01 07:07:45 "long day, i can't sleep...  playful  ....aaaaaaaand my kitten just tripped the ""on/off"" button on the power strip to the tv, cable box, and everything else plugged into it so that leaves me..... sitting in the dark... woo. happy monday. (yes i know its tuesday, but the ""day"" hasn't quite ended for me..."

2011-03-25 18:46:27 "just watched an old, white haired man share a cheeseburger he had cupped in both hands, foil an' all, with his not so groomed collie in the front seat of a rusted old chevy truck. love is in the air..."
2011-03-26 18:38:01 somehow dodged a hangover and <propfirst> is awake. i'm 2 for 2!!!
2011-03-27 17:56:33 what a big day for the little vcu guys that made all this way. its got to be a huge milestone for them. they will always remember the day that they they made it all the way to the elite 8 and had the privilege to get their ass kicked by the hawks. i bet if they're good sports they can get an autograph or two.
2011-03-27 19:37:08 "all of a sudden i've got the munchies and feel the need to do some serious online shopping. my body, and my bank account for that matter, can't handle this game right now."
2011-03-29 20:22:49 "just a little update. tawd went in for surgery this morning. he's probably gonna be pretty sore and slow-moving, after all, he's not a normal cat, and they will not only be removing his uniball, but his undescended testicle as well as the frost bitten tip of his tail. we'll be picking him up shortly. all get well soon ecards can be sent to emilyharvey03@gmail.com. thanks in advance..."
2011-04-03 16:13:46 "a year ago today i finally decided (after makin <propfirst> wait almost a whole week) that we put up with each other pretty well, in fact, i liked the guy, a lot, and that we should shock the world and call ourselves a ""couple"". a year later and i've only wanted to kill him a couple times and shake him to death a few, but dang it <propfirst> <propmale>, i still love you! happy 1 year babe."
2011-04-05 15:51:46 i really want to get into some rec leagues this summer... softball... volleyball... anyone???
2011-04-05 22:40:03 your stomach ever feel like you just swallowed an entire gallon of vinegar? ouch! and why?!?
