2009-09-25 09:10:27 "spare manson ticket. brisbane, october 17. contact jassy <propfirst>"

2009-08-30 17:45:16 "nearly 36 hours awake. wow. ...you know, if you haven't tried pot its like a really light version of being extremely tired. except your eyes feel normal when you're stoned, and you don't lose your intelligence  annoyed  i have a hunch this status is good testament to that fact."

2009-09-07 12:26:54 "i don't write for my audience, i write for me. any true 'artist' creates only to satisfy his or her own passion, to liberate their imagination and maybe to capture a moment of pure, unadulterated personal e playful ression. if you write for fans, you're nothing more than a glorified journalist."
2009-09-14 02:05:16 "is sleepy at a friend's house. woken up early ftl. listening to manson on laptop before leaving. apparently he's a ""faggot""  laugh "

2009-09-03 04:25:55 i can see clearly now the (insomnia) is gone..
2009-10-15 17:39:43 "has pruned this status down to: i am good, about to sleep. not a lot of work is being done but i'm confident the obstacles won't last long.  take two adventurers contemplating crossing a mountain; one plans the shit out of that idea, the other just sets his sights on the end goal and rushes off confident he can improvise and overcome whatever hits him along the way. for better or worse, i'm the latter."
2009-09-12 08:28:51 save a penguin - fuck a squirrel
2009-10-24 11:55:22 sleeeeeeeeepy. funeral and family shit all day. cool to see people though  smile

2009-10-26 07:09:41 <propfirst> <propfemale> wood naked =o <end perve>
2009-09-14 06:50:33 less drama plox
2009-10-18 17:19:21 "just wrote a letter and <propfirst> a picture for his girlyfriend. along with presents,  its going in the mail tomorrow."
2009-09-09 17:54:47 just looked through the blacklist of internet sites to be blocked by the australian government. i'm disgusted and offended that anyone dare try to take my *internationally free* right to free access of information away from me.  if australia lays down and cannibalises itself of its freedoms i will say to anyone that chose to be ignorant or chose to let it slide: you deserve everything you get. <propfemale> will die.
2009-10-29 16:25:30 "i am made of scars. armored like a tank and built for destruction, rebirth and enlightment; you pointed out the wounds of the earth."
2009-10-22 14:22:46 "had a busy day. went to launceston and back and is now officially a burnie resident again.  relative died, girlfriend's birthday.."
2009-10-05 21:04:17 "woke at 7, writing  joyful "
2009-09-25 06:23:37 gets annoyed by cops and concerned citizens in newspapers. i thought peer pressure was supposed to end in highschool? fuck off and let me do my own thing in peace.
2009-11-01 17:17:27 "i'm one of those rare people that watches a good vs. evil movie and truly feels a passionate empathy with the bad guy.  i think if you use intelligence, wit and cunning to achieve something then you deserve it. all i can do is analyze why the majority of people disagree."
2009-11-12 05:29:36 "retweeting <propfemale> harbin from twitter: kyle_towns and i are the <propfirst> and <propfemale> of a new generation. be very, very scared."
2009-11-15 11:01:43 "just a shout out to anyone who just received an invitation to 'become a fan' of me. this is my writing <propfemale> and i'd ask you to check out my stuff, see what you think. i've got the first chapter of a book out there, more coming soon. thankyou."
2009-11-11 09:18:10 finds it amusing i've been voted 'most absentee' ie. most likely to skip class.  just on the notion itself - it depends if there's anything worth learning!
2009-10-04 22:53:46 "every person that tries to convince me i can't do what i want (e.g. be an author) is only going to make me more determined.  i look forward to ignoring those that will turn around and compliment me. fuck backstabbers, fuck socialism, fuck conformity and fuck all claims of power."
2009-11-12 15:51:06 suddenly feels like having a drink with <propfirst> shore.
2009-10-02 15:44:08 is pondering self-publishing with lulu.com
2009-11-11 17:37:10 and <propfemale> harbin - the <propfirst> and <propfemale> for a new generation. hands up!
2009-09-30 17:12:30 "getting there, getting there, getting there.. looking at my future is like looking at the horizon, out at sea. its a long way off and there's a lot of crap to <propmale> through before you get there. and then bam(!) tropical island. (hopefully without things that will eat me.)"
2009-09-19 23:44:33 you know you must have been drunk when you don't remember 90% of the photos from the night before  annoyed 
2009-10-10 05:52:26 writing today. listening to <propmale> zombie's new track 'sick bubble-gum' on bravewords.com knuckletracks. 5/10.
2009-11-23 05:20:44 is having trouble finding a job and really needs $2k to get myself in a good position to continue writing. any (decent) suggestions?
2009-09-23 16:04:35 "is hoping to get more work done soon. also: i love laptops. in my parent's basement with my mum, smoking a cigarette before i go to bed, on wireless internet."
2009-11-29 07:11:56 """i will tell you what i will do and what i will not do. i will not serve that in which i no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and i will try to e playful ress myself in some mode of life or <propmale> as freely as i can and as wholly as i can, using for my defence the only arms i allow myself to use - silence, exile, and cunning."" <propfirst> <propfemale> - a portrait of the artist as a young man"
2009-12-05 04:32:28 """its nice to be important but its more important to be nice."" i always thought this was stupid. i counter with: its great to be liked but its more important to be happy (and in my case, successful.)"
2009-12-08 07:05:43 reading this makes me want to punch someone. really hard. http annoyed /bit.ly/7e4etg
2009-12-05 07:37:03 "for once i don't have enough time (mainly because adobe acrobat is huge.) reminder to self: make sample and full book pdfs, finish up kyletowns.blogspot.com. organise release."

2009-11-24 05:04:43 conflict charges me because it reminds me that my position is often controversial yet no less valid than any other. i'm often forced to fight for my equal standing just for being different. i won't be destroyed.  the events behind this statement are coming soon.
2009-12-14 16:00:59 "just spend a while buggering around with facebook code. now i have sexy boxes with book information on my facebook <propfemale> and profile. hooray! (yeah, i'm blowing time  wink "

2009-12-19 17:00:57 "just had an idea so simple, i don't know why it never occurred to me. i need $2k to move forward, right? no job opportunities, slow income.  but i'm a self-motivated writer with potential. all i need is a few months of (alone) time. so.. i need to be an investment opportunity. calling all <propmale> grandmas, <propfirst> needs a <propfemale>. will pay 15% interest. return in under a year. yeah, i wish."
2009-11-30 12:12:18 "fill in the blank: before the end of 2009, you and i should _____."
