2011-07-03 18:53:00 "let me get this straightâ€¦ <propfirst> sheen can make a â€œporn familyâ€�, <propfemale> grammar can end a 15 year marriage over the phone, <propfirst> <propmale> can be on divorce #9, <propfemale> spears can have a 55 hour marriage, and <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods, while married, were having sex with everyone. yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage? really? repost if you are proud to support equal rights."
2011-08-05 00:56:08 "a 15 year old girl holds hands with her 1 year old son. people call her a slut, but no one knows she was raped at 13. people call another guy fat. no one knows he has a serious disease causing him to be overweight. people call an old man ugly. no one knew he had a serious injury to his face while fighting for our country in the war. repost this if you are against bullying and stereotyping. i bet 96% of you won't."
2011-08-16 17:51:55 "stupid cancer... we all want a new car... a new phone... freedom... a person who has cancer only wants one thing... to survive. i know a lot of you ""who think you're too cool"" probably won't repost this. but a very little amount of my friends will. put this on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer, survived, or who is fighting against it now"
