2011-06-30 05:41:25 "just plays some songs on my clarinet, felt good and felt bad   good to relive my joy of music and the e playful ression it allows, bad because of how awful i am at it now and how far i have to work to be even decent again   it's still there though, i'm sure   i promised one of my lab buddies that i would play something at our retreat this saturday   haha    we shall see if i can't pull something through!"
2011-07-04 15:39:23 "the retreat with my lab turned out really nice, especially when they weren't all talking in chinese, haha   a lot of them were really good cooks and some of the couples brought their kids   i ended up playing a lot more than anticipated but they seemed to enjoy it all   professor even mentioned making a band since he has some dream with the drums   hmmmmm    "

2011-07-23 23:42:53 "just got around to finishing the first portal   started it awhile back, but never finished it   pretty epic ending, won't spoil it for any who have yet to see it, but epic final boss is pretty epic   hopefully i'll nab the sequel sometime soon     no spoilers!"
