2011-04-27 20:48:01 this year july has 5 fridays 5 saturdays and 5 sundays. this happens once every 823 years. this is called money bags. so copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days. based on chinese philosophy of feng shui. those who read and do not copy will be without money. so let's all try our luck at this and see what happens. what the heck? we could all use some more $$$.
