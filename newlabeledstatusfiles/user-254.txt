2010-06-20 07:15:21 i've come to the realisation that when it comes down to it nobody- and i mean nobody really has your back. i guess that's why we're supposed to <propfemale> on jesus... even though we can't see him or can't always hear him... that is so hard to do cause i'm  a realist. but he has stripped me of all distractions i guess...
