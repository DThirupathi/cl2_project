2010-12-13 11:30:36 conflicts are never solved with words. i know you are not sincere with what you say anyways.
2010-12-30 03:52:15 i have sworn to myself that i am content with loneliness.
2010-12-28 09:42:21 i wanted you to know how i feel but i thought that i would just keep it to myself. you don't need to know that whenever i hurt you it hurts me too. that after we parted i wanted you back so badly. that i wanted to take all those hurtful words that i've said. that i hope you'd come back and forgive me. that my love for you hasn't faded.

2010-12-27 12:43:14 if you say something and really mean in but this person whom you told doesn't believe you... then don't mean it. better do it with someone who appreciates you.
2011-02-11 12:27:34 "nhof l. bacquian i still love you and i probably will love you for a very long time. but i can't just be your <propmale>, because as much as i enjoy the concept of being ""just friends"" in reality it's a bizarre form of torture and i'm just not willing to participate in it. so right now what i wanna do is just move on and get over you and the only way for me to do that is to not be around you anymore."
