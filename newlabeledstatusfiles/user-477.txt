2009-11-22 01:47:42 "just got back from the 101 dalmatians play that the middle and elementary schools put on at the high school! woot! great job, <propfemale>, or should i say cruella, you were awesome! and <propfemale>, you made an awesome chihuahua! hahaha"
2009-11-01 06:03:20 "a decent halloween, a bit disappointed. e playful erienced some awesome costumes & some cool people in the tunnels/sidewalks from perkins to the dorms. and a really weird pair of people in green bodysuits with green material over their faces following me around through the tunnels and communicating with me through crude sign language, and dancing. interesting to say the least. really wished we had taken a walk though...."
2009-12-09 04:17:46 "i was just guessin', at <propfirst> and figures... pulling the puzzles apart. questions of science, science and progress, do not speak as loud as my heart. tell me you love me, come back and haunt me, oh and i rush to the start. runnin' in circles, chasin' tails, comin' back as we are..."
2009-06-15 04:34:55 ...hi! i am home now. <propfemale>. um... there's a storm here and it's cool. aaaand... i guess i am gunna try to edit the story. <propfemale>. umm... yup!
2009-07-05 01:01:23 "can't find a job... so is finding alternative ways to make money, some including writing and others including drawing. she officially will be busy until the <propfemale> of time, but feel free to leave a message after the beep. *beeep*"
2009-11-15 18:34:56 "had a frikkin blast last night playing <propfirst> party with <propfirst> green and <propmale> guglielmo  i actually started to lose my voice from screaming at the tv, partially because yoshi was winning for a bit! (""i... don't know what that thing is."" ""what thing?"" ""that thing."" ""what thing?"" ""yoshi."") squid time!!! and dog time... by the time i went to bed it was waaaay past woof o'clock, i know that much"
2009-10-28 10:07:31 registration is retarded. 6am? really? come ooooon...
2009-11-27 22:46:10 "is finally going to update the quotes site at some point tonight. also will do a bit of cleaning tonight. also, will goof off tonight. i think i'm gunna like tonight."
2009-12-02 00:05:13 "we sailed on together, we drifted apart"
2009-06-26 23:12:01 workin on stuff  laugh 
2009-11-18 03:16:20 why are the openers to inuyasha so... nooot as good as all the ending themes? (on episode 58 right now)
2009-07-27 03:55:31 amazing! house of hair is finishing up with my <propfemale>. and i was just gunna say it had been disappointing this week!
2009-01-03 02:03:44 "is finally back. which is great! except... class on monday!!! grr!! i am ""not a happy camper..."" ~jim gaffigan"
2009-01-02 17:51:48 "going back to rit today... i think this is the first break ever where i haven't wanted to go back. for those i didn't get to see, this totally sucks... sorry i kept being sick  sad "
2010-01-05 12:51:11 "you canâ€™t pick up not a single sound, you feel youâ€™re winning, thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about, knowing you are winning, oooh, and it could be the very last time, i could be in a rock â€˜nâ€™ roll dream."
2010-01-05 07:54:48 "well, i should be going to bed. there's one key word in that sentence. and now ignoring everything i've just said here, i am going to work on my poster and listen to awesome music. for those of you who sleep, goodnight!"
2010-01-08 13:46:38 so remember that time when <propfirst> was supposed to leave? like 4 hours ago? well he finally left!  laugh  i black-holed him on accident  annoyed 
2010-01-07 23:31:55 "since the ac/dc concert, i have had 3 dreams tht i've been about to see them again. the dreams always end either before they get on stage or right when they're about to. so i wake up in the midst of one today and tell myself it's gunna finish when i go back to sleep. and it did! they played whole lotta <propfemale>, &then it ended in a nightmare! but then <propfirst> <propmale> sat next to me & i got to talk to him so it's okay."
2009-09-06 16:32:09 "just actually realized what i said to <propfirst> last night... krystal: ""grumptus is dying..."" <propfirst>: ""i know...  sad "" krystal: ""and he doesn't even get to be grumpy anymore, because now he's in a teacup!"" ....."
2010-01-12 06:20:05 "we're the middle children of history. no purpose or place. we have no great war. no great depression. our great war's a spiritual war... our great depression is our lives. we've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. but we won't. and we're slowly learning that fact. and we're very, very pissed off."
2010-01-14 15:26:07 "holy crap on a rack. just had a lovely breakfast with rohit crasta and now is chillin on campus. meeting quidditch people at 12 smile 0 to talk about... quidditch... and then will hopefully have lunch with rohit again, and then is going to class! *gasp!* today's weird."
2009-01-01 08:02:24 "heralded in the new year by playing about 4 hours of ac/dc rockband drums. now that's what i call a celebration. for those of you who rock, you have been saluted. for those who don't.... weeeell, you suck."
2009-08-18 04:04:16 "just keeps coming up with more and more stuff for the series... talking to <propmale> the other night and re-watching <propfemale> mononoke tonight were huge contributing factors. this is pretty exciting, gotta say..."
2010-01-11 01:17:18 "lost out at sea on a wave, somebody's gotta save, gotta save me. i'm someone that i've never seen, somewhere i'd thought i never, never would be."
2010-01-23 11:44:03 omg... i just had another dream about ac/dc. except this one was longer and even more detailed and more ridiculous than ever. i just wish that i could have a dream about seeing them in concert without something terrible happening -_-
2010-01-14 10:34:19 "feel loved, feel loved. but we don't, and we won't, until we figure out... could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign? so close to giving up, cause faith is so hard to find. but you don't and you won't, until we figure out..."
2010-01-23 19:07:02 "has fixed her computer so that when she changes the volume, it no longer goes, ""bloop!"""
2009-10-07 16:44:42 wiiiiiindy!!!!  laugh   laugh  and lots of kangaroos
2010-01-27 17:44:19 has come to a couple big decisions. i feel like this is the first time i've decided anything in about a year. but i'm still far from a personal victory. about as far as you can get.
2010-01-11 02:47:49 "what if i got it wrong? and no poem or song, could put right what i got wrong. and make you feel i belong."
2010-02-01 04:56:53 "this is what you get. this is what you get. this is what you get when you mess with us... for a minute there, i lost myself, i lost myself. yeah for a minute there, i lost myself, i lost myself."
2010-01-29 17:28:51 a green guitar is probably the best thing ever...
2010-01-30 23:13:38 okay... writing a semi-creepy story that takes place during a thunderstorm while i'm sitting in the dark apartment with the creaking floor/walls and clicking radiator and other weird sounds while listening to classical music... yeah. great combination. *hurries up and turns lights on*
2009-09-22 01:04:37 "is doing tooons of japanese homework and has a kanji quiz tomorrow! good thing i studied japanese on my own before coming to rit, or seriously, i would know like, 2 kanji characters. damn."
2010-02-05 21:16:09 "suggestions? i'm modeling for <propfemale>'s photoshoot tomorrow and am trying to figure out a famous person who has passed away that i can be for this shoot. her original idea was <propfemale> carpenter, but i'm trying to think if there's someone else i look more like, or could pull off better. has to be someone who is not alive!"
2010-01-15 12:35:14 is pumped. somehow.
2010-01-26 20:11:37 "[of mtv/tv] ""you get it, and at first it's novel and brand new and then you watch every channel, every show. and then you become a little more selective, and more selective, until ultimately... you wind up with a radio."" ~david <propfirst> roth"
2010-02-04 04:10:59 is in a huge <propmale> watanabe mood so is going to watch memoirs of a geisha. if i'm up for it after i might watch letters from iwo jima  annoyed  and is eating cuz i'm starving
2010-02-08 22:11:28 "echoes and silence, <propfemale> and grace. all of these moments i'll never replace. no fear of my heart, absence of faith. and all i want... is to be home."
2010-02-09 19:05:04 so the last thing i e playful ected/planned today was to wake up run out the door to catch lunch with rohit and <propfirst>... and then get invited to go to their classes with them. yet here i am in their web design class. go figure.
2010-02-10 03:03:43 "is glad she got to see rohit and <propfirst> today and also glad she she only went to one out of two of their classes (yes, i said their classes). but now feels kind of blah. figuring out what i feel like doing. meh."
2010-02-07 20:38:48 "i've been lookin back on my life & all the things i've done to me. i'm still lookin for the answers, i'm still searchin for the key. the wreckage of my past keeps haunting me, it just wont leave me alone. i still find it all a mystery could it be a dream? the road to nowhere leads to me. through all the happiness & sorrow i guess i'd do it all again. live for today & not tomorrow. it's still the road that never ends."
2009-10-05 23:22:49 "1-1 so far, let's see how this game goes... speed up guys!"
2010-02-21 08:01:09 has noticed that watching doctor who consistently puts me in the mood to write. i wish i had something i was working on that fit that genre/tone more so that the mood could properly <propfemale> over....
2009-10-25 19:18:14 coloring her netry for the deviantart halloween contest  laugh  despite that i have tons of homework and a halloween costume to be making -_-;
2010-02-11 06:47:27 "well uh uh baby i ain't got no plan, we'll float on maybe, would you understand? ...i like songs about drifters, books about the same, they both seem to make me feel a little less insane."
2010-02-13 02:14:09 "i am entertained. dubinsky just said, of crosby, ""he can be such a little baby at times."" good game so far, we stepped it up in the 2nd period. let's keep it up for the 3rd!"
2010-01-26 17:24:19 "wth! i put on pandora internet radio while looking up <propfirst> halen on wikipedia. <propfirst> halen comes on! then look up ac/dc merchandise online and just click a site, ac/dc comes on! .....aaaahhh!"
2010-02-12 20:33:23 "was sick all last night and got no sleep til 7 smile 0 am... however, i had a dream about ac/dc again and this time nothing bad happened in it. it was a good concert. and also, <propmale> is amazing."
2010-02-15 20:20:33 playing the guitar... makes me wants to take a nap. i'm not giving in though.
2009-10-30 14:20:35 "halloween weather forecast: two websites say there will be am showers; one says rain all day. the last time it rained on halloween for me, i was in 6th grade  annoyed   please please please please pleeeaaase don't rain all day.... this is going to totally blow..."
2010-02-15 05:26:54 "is rewatching the clips recorded thus far from the movie that <propfemale> and i are making (with the help of <propfirst>, <propfemale>, and <propfemale>). dear god this is the crappiest, but absolutely funniest, movie ever. i'm actually looking forward to summer so we can work on this again. and the bloopers are <propfemale>."
2009-10-11 17:37:35 i probably have like 10 homework assignments or something. i should probably check on that. hooot pockeeets!
2010-01-24 08:51:19 "watching men in tights at almost 4 am with <propmale>, <propfirst>, and pietr. what else could you want for a saturday night/near morning thing?"
2010-01-25 01:55:24 "who remembers when the moose was on the loose in cohoes? and they <propmale> up those stupid signs around the city with the picture of the moose head that said, ""moose on the loose in cohoes""?"
2010-02-18 22:36:31 is listening to satriani and then onto some yngwie malmsteen... aahh... *reclines back in chair to the sounds of 'with jupiter in mind'*
2010-01-28 17:46:51 """how do i get through to you that wishes just come true in dreams? in my dreams."" ~dio"
2010-02-13 05:52:39 "feeling waaaaaay better now, and we won the game tonight 3-2 in overtime. now... to find something to do until i'm actually tired."
2009-10-31 06:33:58 really wishes she wasn't still awake working on her costume... i want sleep
2010-02-18 21:15:31 "i think pretty woman still has this beat when it comes to cheesy music videos, but hot for teacher is a contender in my book. i love dlr at the beginning with his, ""sit dooown, <propmale>!"" and then later choreographed dancing... teachers in bikinis... ridiculousness, but somehow amazing still"
2010-02-24 10:20:32 "lately i've been measurin'. seems my time is growin' thin. wind me up and watch me spin... watch me spin... watch me spin... skin and bones, skin and bones, skin and bones, don't you know? skin and bones, skin and bones, skin and bones, don't you know? i'm just skin and bones."
2010-02-14 20:39:18 wow. just woke up. hahaha
2010-02-23 05:31:04 "i feel like she sort of accomplished something today. had a great nearly 4 hour lunch with rohit, then studied japanese and worked on some of my own projects. in store for the future: more studying of japanese, working on stuff for toracon (thanks <propfemale>, i still feel bad about this...), and working on more of my projects. is hopeful things will get better in other areas of my life."
2010-02-22 03:03:30 "that game was excellent. very intense. canada kept pushing us to skate faster and made us keep picking up our game to the next level. usa victory 5-3, and with an empty-netter too. and not to mention, beating crosby really makes this win feel even better."
2010-02-27 01:08:53 "cause i remember all the times that i tried so hard, and you laughed in my face, cause you held all the cards. i don't care anymore. and i really ain't bothered what you think of me, cause all i want of you is to just let me be. i don't care anymore. do ya hear? i don't care anymore. i don't care what you say, i never did believe you much anyway."
2010-03-02 23:22:14 "i'm just a dreamer, i dream my life away. i'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days. i watch the sun go down like every one of us. hoping that the <propfemale> will bring a sign."
2010-02-21 23:14:22 "standing in the rain, with his head <propmale> low couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream he heard one guitar, just blew him away he saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day bought a beat up six string, in a secondhand store didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure..."
2010-02-16 07:11:13 "you're a drop in the rain, just a number, not a name, and you don't see it. you don't believe it. at the end of the day, you're a needle in the hay, you signed and sealed it. and now you gotta deal with it. humanity, humanity. goodbye."
2010-02-28 23:08:28 "i really don't mind that canada won. what i do mind, however, is that crosby got the game-winning goal in overtime. he really does have an ego, and this is the last thing that we all needed- for it to get fed. congratulations to the canadian players with professional attitudes that the cameras don't stalk, you did really well."
2010-02-20 08:34:08 "interviewer: ""do you consider yourself a <propfemale>?"" bon scott: ""i see <propfemale>s, sometimes."""
2010-03-01 04:29:20 "no matter how well i forget everything, you bring it crashing back down with one ring, of my telephone; had been docile all day. no matter, no matter how far away, i get from it all, by tooth and nail and claw, you're dragging me down."
2010-03-05 01:30:31 <propfirst> <propfemale> adventures season 1 complete!!!! now commence the probable waiting for another 7 months to watch the next one.
2010-03-06 22:59:16 "working on some prints for tora-con, then studying the crap out of japanese. then maybe starting on some commissions. thanks to those of you who responded so quickly to my note. whether you were tagged in it or not, please take a look  annoyed "
2010-02-15 02:31:52 "cuz yesterday's got nothing for me, oh, pictures that i'll always see. time just fades the pages in my book of memories. i'll just keep movin' along, no time to plant my feet."
2009-11-07 03:27:25 "so i know what i should not be doing! trying to make a role playing game based on my book. ...but i totally should be. but no, i shouldn't be. is this due to dnd withdrawal? and lack-of-working-on-my-book-series withdrawal? probably."
2010-03-08 00:20:52 rangers versus sabres tonight! let's go!
2010-03-08 02:23:48 "can you say.... dubiiiinskyyy!?!? tying it up with 1:26 on the clock, time for sudden death overtime, boys! i could go for a shoot out right now..."
2010-03-07 17:27:08 is awake? and working on something? and then going out somewhere? .....[enough to like?] whoa.
2009-11-27 06:56:59 "just got in a from a ridiculous night with my cousins, and heading back to rit tomorrow. i'm kind of disappointed that i literally got no time to relax this entire vacation, so after more cleaning and studying when i get back to school, that is what i plan on doing."
2010-03-10 20:21:48 "come on baby finish what ya started, i'm in compleeeete. that ain't no way to treat the broken hearted. i need some sympathhyyyy!"
2010-03-10 07:42:42  annoyed  accidentally kept <propmale> awake for like an hour past when he was going to go to bed. now he just stumbled away to go pass out @_@ ..whooops
2010-03-11 18:21:52 "there's a time and place for everything, for everyone. we can push with all our might, but nothing's gunna come. nothing's gunna change. and if i ask you not to try, would you let it be? i want to hold you and say, we can't throw this all away, tell me you won't go, won't go, do you have to hear me say...?"
2010-03-12 00:04:30 "well, i'm not sure who the conductor is in the visit, if it's a train conductor (i know there's a scene at a train station) or if it's a choir conductor (i also know there's a choir), but whoever or whatever they are, apparently that's who i'm being in the play."
2010-03-10 20:48:26 "miss the beat, you lose the rhythm. nothing falls into place. only missed by a fraction, slipped a lil' off your pace. the more things you get the more you want; just trade in one for another. workin so hard to make it easier, whoa gotta turn- c'mon!- turn this thing around right now. hey, s'your tomorrow! right now, c'mon it's everything! right now. catch a magic moment, do it right here and now. it means everything"
2010-03-03 20:23:08 "pretty much perfect weather outside right now! <propfemale> but the clouds make it not obnoxiously bright, slightly cool (yes, 35 degrees is slightly cool for me), and slightly breezy. not to mention i just bought gushers, two flavors of frozen lemonade, and successfully resisted buying two boxes of toaster strudels. now onward with the day!!"
2010-02-25 21:18:33 "and an old guitar is all he can afford, when he gets up under the lights to play his thing"
2010-03-05 19:10:27 "i had yet another dream about ac/dc performing in the ccs gym. except the gym was on the 2nd floor, and ac/dc was so loud that they cracked a hole in the floor! people downstairs were like > surprise  but some came upstairs to watch. before they could play ddddc the ccs owner people told them they had to leave. but i got to talk to <propfirst> before that and he was so cool... and he gave me a hug. and <propfirst> was with me!!"
2010-03-18 20:25:13 "sitting here with the windows open, and seeing the clear blue sky outside, and blaring <propfirst> halen has made me realize <propfirst> <propfirst> roth was beyond right when he said that <propfirst> halen is a summer band. their music coincides so well with nice weather!! prolly better than any other band i've ever heard!"
2010-03-13 07:12:07 "played buhgasketball and <propmale> guglielmo got his revaaaahnge! uuggghhhh! *poke* also, <propfirst> senft apparently has two more hours of watch to lost."
2010-03-17 04:46:33 "somehow, it is the 17th already. it feels like it was just <propmale>'s birthday and now it's the middle of the month? what the hell..."
2010-03-15 20:49:41 "cause i feel you cross my mind, in dissarray, intoxicated ricochet. there's nothing wrong. just don't take too long."
2010-01-20 18:20:53 "i wanted to feel you, i tried to belong here, with all of the ghosts and faded headlines. but i couldn't read you; no, you wouldn't let me. you always pull away from the ones you can't define. are you tired of holding up the sky? and teaching birds to fly? you've done it all your life..."
2010-01-18 13:05:15 "<propfirst> <propmale> <propmale> jr.'s birthday today. he was a real leader of men and an inspiration. let us all let today inspire us to work towards peace, even in small ways, amongst our family and friends for example. be kind to someone today. let's do it up."
2010-02-06 03:11:53 okay. guess it's decided. i'm going to be <propfemale> gardner for the photo thing. thanks for your suggestions for those who actually gave real ones! thanks for everyone else for the joke ones that made me laugh! (still woulda liked to have been <propfemale> joplin but it's all good!)
2010-02-11 20:07:23 "well it woulda been, coulda been, worse than you would ever know.... oh the dashboard melted but we still have the radio"
2010-02-13 20:03:59 "well thanks for the time i needed to think a spell, i had to think a while. i had to think a while. the ocean breathes salty, won't you <propfemale> it in? in your head, in your mouth, in your soul. and maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old. well i don't know, i don't know, i don't know. i hope so."
2010-02-22 01:26:52 "okay. macdonald's sponsoring the olympics and having commercials saying ""eat like an olympian"" has got to be the most backwards thing i have ever seen. the last place an olympian athlete is gunna go to eat is macdonald's. in other news, watching usa vs canada for hockey."
2010-08-18 19:24:13 "again, my cell phone is no longer in service. dead. gone for now, maybe forever. it appears i can receive calls but i am not sure if doing so will run up the <propmale> even more; i can not make any calls. i can not text or receive texts. if you want to contact me, use the internet. please do not randomly show up at my house, because i am probably working; once again, i'm online so use the internet. thank you, that is all."

2010-06-02 20:38:24 raise your hand if you are frustrated beyond belief at the lack of information and procedure your college pre-emptively communicates with you. *raises hand*
2010-05-10 01:16:03 "i saw ac/dc on august 2nd, 2009, almost a year ago now... but i've realized something important tonight. a part of me has never really left the times union center, and i don't think it ever will. greatest night of my life."
2010-07-30 20:46:25 "not even 24 hours ago, i thought happily to myself, ""huh. i didn't really have a stalker this past year, did i? let's hope that continues."" and now i think i might have one on deviantart. ...one day i'm going to get myself a crossbow, and go a huntin'."
2010-10-09 23:19:59 the first rangers game of the season is juuuust about to start! can not wait!
2010-09-19 17:36:08 "okay. so i guess i don't have to go to the labs. my computer finally decided it would let me install a trial of cs5. i guess the other 4 times it didn't work were figments of my imagination. well, then."
2010-10-17 05:34:41 i give up. i'm going to bed.
2010-08-31 17:15:43 bread and jam cafe is closing down for good as of friday. i have not gotten an ounce of good news lately.... this is terrible.
2010-11-23 05:13:33 "things that will happen (maybe) by the time we're all 50: we will reach epic tier in dnd, i will graduate from rit finally, and <propfirst> will play mass effect 3."

2011-04-11 14:47:45 "i think that whoever likes this sudden unwanted burst of 70+ degree temperatures should move south and take this weather with them. leave those of us who like milder seasons alone! spring is supposed to be warmer than winter, but it's not summer yet, goddamn it, so quit it"

2011-04-20 00:39:55 "if your elementary school teachers ever told you, ""you have to learn cursive because both in high school and as an adult you'll need to know it!"", you're not alone. it was so ingrained into my head, that whenever i start writing out homework i still will begin writing in cursive before i switch to print after the first sentence...."
2011-04-20 05:04:53 the usual suspects has a great plot twist. just saying.
2011-04-21 02:59:49 "wow, everything is a pain in the ass right now, including the playoffs. damn it."

2011-04-23 21:49:22 "well, thus ends the rangers' season. if we didn't have all those injuries throughout the year, and had been a little more consistent, i think we could have gone further..... damn it..."

2011-05-05 20:37:15 "i haven't been online much lately due to a lot of work since it's nearing finals week, but for the next two days i will not be on at all and probably won't respond to messages; i have a drawing to finish, some prelim stuff for a final drawing, a lot of writing to do for my mythology class, and a website to work on. so i'll see everyone not in the next few days, kaybai"
