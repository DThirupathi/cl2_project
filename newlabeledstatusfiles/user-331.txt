2011-04-29 00:23:48 why does espn take all the suspense out of the draft and show the draft picks when they get called before goodell announces the pick?
2011-04-29 17:48:55 there is literally no point in the british still having a monarchy. they keep antiquated traditions around for the sake of having tradition and ta playful ayers pay for extravagant weddings. the least they could have done is made <propmale> the successor. he looks like he likes to party.
