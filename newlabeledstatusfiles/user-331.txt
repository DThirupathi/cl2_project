"some people like to complicate life, but i prefer it simple. the wind hitting your face, music traveling through your ears, that feeling when you take a real nice shit and theres almost nothing on the toilet paper when you wipe. that's life. its not accomplishments, but e playful eriences. it's good times, great memories; not gpas and geds. long story short, i'm going to start selling heroin. shh, don't tell anyone."
"ggw is back in town. that can only mean one thing. it's time for yet another installment of attempting to break into the ggw bus, or as i call it, whore wagon sabotage 2k11. i encourage all to join in."
i guess i'm kind of like a dog in that i dislike boundaries and just sort of do things arbitrarily
"sometimes on long car rides, i like to switch my radio between laser and channel q until i hear nirvana's smells like teen spirit. between the 2 stations, you can hear it 3 times an hour. then i sing along to the song what i interpret the lyrics to be."
"i like to walk up to strangers and keep saying things like ""how are you?"" just pretend i know them from somewhere. then when they introduce themselves, i just say i thought they were someone else and walk away. ps. i love you lady cop."
"i was too busy to watch da cubs game today, so i just check espn's box score every other inning. then close my eyes and imagine the game going on in my head. this is the best baseball game ever."
"the body is a constant state of flux. a young man with the flu is closer to death than a 90 year old man who feels good. with this thinking, age and birthdays are an irrelevant statistic when measuring just how much of your life has passed thus far."
i think voldemort will finally get <propmale> potter in this last movie. he's been at this for almost 10 years now and has e playful erience on his side and the elder wand. that little fucker is finally going to get whats coming to him after rigging house cups and breaking rules constantly. fuck griffyndor.

"when i count my change, i like to sort it all and stack it a neat pile. as i do this i like to think about where the coins have been before i was given them. the things they have seen, the places they have been."
why does espn take all the suspense out of the draft and show the draft picks when they get called before goodell announces the pick?
there is literally no point in the british still having a monarchy. they keep antiquated traditions around for the sake of having tradition and ta playful ayers pay for extravagant weddings. the least they could have done is made <propmale> the successor. he looks like he likes to party.
"if there is one piece of advice i can leave you all with, it would be this. put goldbond powder on your testicles. it feels incredible. be sure it's the stuff in the green bottle. the yellow bottle is foot medicine or some shit."
