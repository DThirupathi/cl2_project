its not about money  its about conciousness
the best things in life aren't bought with cards but with hearts

"global warming is 'man-made' !?!?!?  what about mars and jupiter?  playful sun's activity is changing the phase of our solar-system  and it looks like we are in for a ride  smile "
happy diwali to all!
one word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: that word is love 
there really is an (r)evolution of the mind  
thank you all of you  for your wishes
i hate social networking
it is through the births of holy and saintly persons can we learn and become evolved beings  <propfemale> christmas to all  smile 
a lot to think about  a lot to admire  and very much more to do  but very little time  
wish you all a wonderful time this christmas and new year 
when you miss someone you feel  empty and alone  unable to push yourself to do even the simplest of things  
it needs courage  not cowardice  it needs selflessness  not selfishness  and thats love
i feel the change is near
[social+][s]war[ ]    [b]peace[ ][ ]
i am different  
thanks to all
it is worth to live life for others than to live it for yourself 
our mind- too small and our ego- too big to even comprehend the supreme force(or whatever)
the mind-it always wanders  so as our purpose in life!
i don't believe in changing the world  i want to be the change that i want to see 
"if you look at people or a cow, a dog or an elephant, or anything and everything with an equal eye  then you can become an enlightened person--srimad bhagwad <propfemale>"
a simple word will speak thousand pictures   smile 
plenty of things happening in our planet  what a phenomenal time to live!!
life is getting unfolded by interesting happenings
peace to this world
something is wrong
"<propfemale> will win today  come on <propfemale>  play just like any other game  come on gambhir and kohli needs a good partnership  yuvi and dhoni will finish it  lets dedicate this win to sachin  "
dhoni's move is brilliant  he comes ahead of yuvraj and rotating the strike  awesome with gambhir  and preserving yuvi for the finish  captain cool rocks   laugh   smile 
dhoni is the hero  he came in and took the responsibility  and gambhir  what a player  true gem  
"we are not in information age  we are in entertainment age-mindless, filthy, stupid and useless entertainment  smile "
started e playful loring terragen 2  
only the feeling of 'oneness' can truly blend this country  politics is a tool of seperation and deception  winning and losing matters no more  it is in the conscious sprint that this land's <propfemale> be reinstated  but the sprint has to come from within ourselves and not by merely switching political gears 
i don't belong and thats my greatest treasure 
life is just a ride-too complex to worry and too short to hate 
time changes everything  but it cannot change what has already happened 
we are all ignorant of something or the other  but the true quality of a man lies in eradicating that ignorance and not letting it rule the mind
