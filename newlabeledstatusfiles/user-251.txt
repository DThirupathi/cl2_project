"enjoying my last hour with sylus, we're at the park! i love to see my son so happy, it disgust me to have to take him to his mom! it's almost like leaving your child on the steps at a church! you ever feel like you're abandoning your child, cause society says you have to!"
"i'm not tellin anyone again, you've drawn the last straw! you wanted to see what i keep inside, now you'll get every fuckin bit!"
"you never wanted to be, you only wanted a better day. you only wanted to be free, what the fuck is free about it?"
"the way you are when you are young, usually is the person you will be in later life! if satisfying your sexual drive was important to you then, and you think that you're ready for a relationship with a single being, don't say you love them, unless that's what is true! if you feel that you don't want to be with that person for the rest of your life, don't lead them to believe it!"
"sylus and i went and picked some flowers for samita, i just couldn't not think about her today! we set them up im a nice vase, made it look all pretty, then i took sylus over to see mama, it is mother's day after all! plus, i never really stopped caring about the girl wink "
"goddamn, if i would have known how to search for stuff like this, i wouldn't be where i'm at today!!!!! i picked a whore that needs multiple partners to feel alive, who e playful ects to be fucked by someone different every weekend!!!!! her past reflects it, but i thought people could change, she likes to be degraded, used as a toy!!!!! they are right, can't turn a whore into a house wife, learned first hand!!!!!"
"if anyone has anything to say about what i post, call me and i'll let you know exactly how the fucking shit is! 1-319-473-0001, she destroyed a perfectly good man! now i'm pist, and i deserve to bitch a little! i complicate us all, with the way i rip it like a chainsaw!"
"gotta find a place to live, no income and the rents due tomorrow! crying "
"how do you walk away from an idea that is shared between two? after all the talks, and feelings shared on the idea, when can you just stop caring? a real life person couldn't, but someone concerned more about themselves, then someone they created, would have no problem throwing away a dream that was envisioned for a lifetime of love! the ups and downs are all apart of this dream, deal with them!"
"love is a false emotion, it makes you happy, then sad, it make you feel, and then numb! i loved so much, and i still love so much, but i hate the fact that i can't stop my love, especially when i gave so much to this emotion! i hate the fact that she don't love, but i still <propfemale> on cause i still love! i hate her for making me fall in love, but love her cause it's the best that ever happened to me!"

"fuckin just saw a ghost, no just my reflection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! need to sleep"
"i put my foot on your face, you can't escape, this is your fate! it's been decided, made terminal! shove once more, and i'll murder you all!"
"i can't stand when you take all your time and effort and put it on a certain cause, but then it turns out that you did it all for nothing! if your cause isn't worthy enough for the ones involved, then walk away from it before the others do, that way you don't end up hurt!"
"motherfuck's really think and say the shit about me, you are all some fuckin low life worthless ass bitch made motherfucker's yourself, you better look at you own face, cause it's a fuckin broken mirror itself! now do you want to fuckin profile me!"
"ready to go get sylus, i know he's ready too! he's always ready to come over to dad's place, he knows daddy loves him! he's daddy's will to live, the only reason dad bites his tongue, and still hands out a smile!!"

"just moved the majority of my stuff, all that's left is the big stuff, not bad for 3 guys and an hour of workin time!"
"when you love once, and are content with that love, how do you ever love again when the love that you love falls apart? how did it fall apart though when you still want and need it! love is kind of a one-sided field! the ref. never pulls a flag for the home team, the foul always benefits the opposition! hell of a game, huh?"
