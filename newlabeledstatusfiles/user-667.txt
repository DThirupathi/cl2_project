school.
should go to sleep. summer school in the morning. ew.
and teenuh are gonna <propfemale> crayola for all the crayons they've got.
has homework. this is cruel.
thinks that people should talk to her. she feels left out from her old aew crowd.
"""you were only given this life because you are strong enough to live it."""
"is enjoying talking as if she were an immensely educated individual. if all of humanity were to speak this way, the world would be far more enjoyable."
"be off to sleep, my loves, for the night is calling you. did you know that yesterday morning each of your spines grew? something about the pressures of walking, and things of that sort, but i hope you sleep very well, and do not end up in court! i love you?"
is sad that <propfirst> mays died. i'll miss my obnoxiously loud friend. ):
has her hair straightened. woopie.
is watching antm and sleeping and working on her health project all at once. lovely day.
is really dizzy. she hopes that she will not fall over.
wants to wish everyone a happy culmination day : d
"thought it was thursday and got really excited. too bad it's monday, and i still have two more school days until the weekend. it's longer than it seems, i promise."
is hanging out with <propfemale> today : d
"'s granny is at the hospital. nothing too serious, just old people stuff. and news is that she'll be well enough to come home tonight."
"feels it was only worth seeing hp because of the people she was with  love  oh, and the random bursts of laughing during the most serious parts of the movie were fun, too.  smile "
is watching iron chef. the voice over voices are terribly annoying.
"has no idea what to put as her status. therefore, this is what you get."
wants to <propfemale> out with people before the summer is over. be proactive.
it's friday. that means no school tomorrow. that means sleep. yay.
"i just watched house. goodness gracious, that man has issues."
"""they all say that you're no good for me- but i'm too close to turn around- i'll show them they don't know anything- i think i've got you figured out.."""
"has nothing to do today, so she'll finally have time to study for finals. this is a good thing."
"doesn't really know what to do right now. therefore, she's on facebook."
read more of /the joy luck club/ today. we're making progress.
"wow, teenuh, i had such a good time at the commons."
"happy flipping birthday, bryn : d"
is back. now what do i do? hmmm..
sometimes i wish everyone would just.. stop. that everyone would take a few minutes to shut up and listen. the only problem is that it doesn't seem as if that will be happening anytime soon. but maybe i'm too hard on humanity. maybe we all still have at least a little bit of goodness in us. maybe it is possible. yes. it is possible.
"did her sleep study thing last night, and surprisingly, the wires weren't really uncomfortable."
i wish everybody would come back already d:. cause i miss them.. and stuff.. ):
"so, apparently well groomed horses look like unicorns."
i'm really thankful for the ability to love and be loved right now. just thought you should know.  love 
"today has been really nice. i'm in a good mood, too. i should go to the beach more often. when it's freezing and <propfemale> and dark out, of course. oh, and the people that were there were pretty great, too.  smile "
this is my status.
"""i wondered why my <propfemale> had been decided, why i should have an unhappy life so someone else could have a happy one."""
is awake.
"""adventure most unto itself the soul condemned to be; attended by a single hound - its own identity."""
i've made too many statuses today. maybe it has to do with the fact that there is absolutely nothing to do today. hopefully tomorrow will be different?
i'm going to go to bed.. maybe..... depends on if anyone comments or messages. then i'm happy to stay up.
listening to sum 41. woopie. for real.
just woke up after going to bed at 4pm yesterday. told you there's some thing wrong with me.
dad and <propmale> are flying to vegas today to get our new red mustang convertible. haha. that's actually very strange.

it's amazing how much better things seem if you let yourself be happy.
the christmas special of bones might just be the best thing ever.
homework+homework+flying monkeys.. just kidding- homework.
"i think i don't want summer to end so much that my mind keeps telling me that tomorrow is not the last day and it's okay for me to sit around doing nothing, when in fact, it is not. help."

my crazy cool essay moment has passed. so here i am. on facebook o.o
i'm just sitting in my room right now. on the laptop. doing nothing. fun.
i gave up. turns out it's not possible for me to concentrate right now.. the solution: facebook.
"summer, summer, please don't go. i will miss you so very so. it is a shame my name isn't moe, cause there's not much else that ends with o."
"logging off, but i have my phone. communicate?"
hmmmmmm..
facebook thinks i'm a dude. life is so unfair.
"""i think won't like him (christian bale) if i get to know him though he seems like an aggravating person why? men can be beautiful my profile picture what picture is that? well it does! it looks like a fake person's smile"" -<propfemale> what are you even saying?"
"i should probably do something today seeing as it is the last day of summer..  but i'll most likely just sit on my bed the whole day staring blankly at my computer screen. sounds so fun. just kidding- it's sounds like one of the most boring things possible. i don't want summer to end, but at the moment it looks like a much better thing to be learning than doing this. ahhhhhhhhh."
summer school is over... but i still have to read 345763 books and write 345763 essays ):... but i /am/ coming to the commons tonight. my mom told me that i should try to have a social life.

"school wasn't all that bad today, but block schedule is messing with my sense of time. yay? yes, yay indeed."
"i'd go to sleep, but i have this problem with not finishing my homework until around 10pm."
"first day.. it was okay. i didn't get lost, which is a plus, but i have almost no friends in any of my classes: none in 3 of them and only one or two in the other three. i'll live- high school is all about meeting new people, right? well, besides achieving academic excellence and all of that stuff. oh, and i get my ribs looked at today  smile . they've been hurting more than ever ):."

i remember way back when when some annoying neighbor of mine made fun of me because i called dinner supper. he said i was such a humble person. i didn't know what humble meant.. so i started crying. and that is my story for today. dinner/supper- be back soon.

"campout tiiiiime. even though i'm not camping out.. my sleep is ""too fragile."" oh, well. i'll still be able to spend today acting like a complete idiot without being judged. well, i may be judged, but i'm pretty sure no one is going to tell me i am an idiot and to get out of their life. it's always a good thing when that doesn't happen. uhmmmm.. so i'm leaving now. clever facebook statuses can wait...  smile "
