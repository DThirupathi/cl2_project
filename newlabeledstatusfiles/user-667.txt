2009-08-08 05:27:24 sometimes i wish everyone would just   stop  that everyone would take a few minutes to shut up and listen  the only problem is that it doesn't seem as if that will be happening anytime soon  but maybe i'm too hard on humanity  maybe we all still have at least a little bit of goodness in us  maybe it is possible  yes  it is possible 
2009-07-31 16:00:15 "did her sleep study thing last night, and surprisingly, the wires weren't really uncomfortable "

2009-08-10 02:10:24 i've made too many statuses today  maybe it has to do with the fact that there is absolutely nothing to do today  hopefully tomorrow will be different?
2009-08-10 06:02:46 i'm going to go to bed   maybe      depends on if anyone comments or messages  then i'm happy to stay up
