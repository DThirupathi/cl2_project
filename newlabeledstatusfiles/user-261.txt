"â€�love is patient and kind  love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude  love does not demand its own way  love is not irritable, and it keeps no record of when it has been wronged  it is never glad about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out  love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance  love will last forever â€�"
"generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need  ~ kahlil gibran"
