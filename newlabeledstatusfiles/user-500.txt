ok to whoever the fuck thought it would be funny to draw and write all over my car in permanent marker... go fuck yourself and if i find out who it was or if this happens again i will fucking kill you... you know how long that took me to clean????
"so, to anyone else who saw inception did you find it to be a huge mindfuck? or is that just me?"
