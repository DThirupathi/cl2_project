2011-03-27 07:37:56 "a busy morning ahead   probably an extremely unpleasant start to the day considering the company i will be in never mind: good laugh to be had tonight with a friend "
2011-03-27 07:47:15 "really lucid dream the other night   it was at once happy (in a way), hopeful about the future, and yet there were problems ahead which suggested future pain   in the dream there was acceptance of the possibilities; they would be dealt with when they arrived, but for the moment at least, life was as it should be it was so clear   so real   and yet so unreal "
2011-02-10 00:01:22 "will i sleep until my alarm wakes me?  i guess only time will tell   6 smile 0am wake up, so what time will i actually awaken?  anyone wanna make a bet?  smile "
