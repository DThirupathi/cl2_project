"i found something strange on wikipedia today. supposedly in swimming ""height is generally considered advantageous in swimming. taller swimmers with longer arms are able to achieve better leverage, hence more acceleration, in the water. this is especially true for freestyle.

so i had a dream last night.....i went to prom in a wonderfully white dress....well not exactly a dress but it was still cool :)
awkward
never crack your head on the lifesaving/spinal board or whatever you want to call it.  it only brings pain in your head and a very tired attitude.  :p

"well, next time you see me, you'll be looking at a certified lifeguard :) i passed!"

"ug.  wsi is such a drag.  luckily, this weekend seems like its gonna be fun :)"
i'd say yesterday night was a success :)
"oh no......it's official..........mike benson and <propfirst> swenson, you guys got me addicted to black ops."

"is pretty glad she got to skip swimming today.  though, she needs the exercise haha ;)"
"i love a girl's night.   watching movies with extremely attractive guys in them and talking about life.  oh, and me, *<propfemale> howe,  <propfemale> larned, and mccoy hawkes' backpacking trip to europe.  now all we need is a couple thousand dollars and we are set!  anyone want to donate? ;)"
well.....today's meet was a super bad meet for me.  ah well better luck next time i guess.
i started shivering horribly today.  i don't know if it's exhaustion or something else but i am running a over 100 degree fever and my parents want me to go to school.....
"well, it's offical.  i am sick."
"okay.  i went a 5:38 on my 500 freestyle, which is dropping 4 seconds.  i went a 2:19 on my 200 im, which is dropping 6 seconds, and on my 400 freestyle relay, i went a 58 low on section of the 100. and instead of taking home two 6th places, i have two 4th places to show for my hard work. oh and if you are a not a swimmer, you will not understand how outstanding i did at this meet :)"
"had a good time staying home and playing assassins creed and just dance 2.  of course, now that the mysterious fever and weird dreams have disappeared, she will probably be at school tomorrow.... :("
wsi is done today! :) whoo technically i could be a swim coach now haha
just had a brilliant idea.  who's in town for spring break?
"""baby close your eyes, don't open till the morning light.  don't ever forget, we haven't lost it all yet.  all we know for sure, is all that we are fighting for. baby don't forget, we haven't lost it all yet."""
i'm free!  i wonder if people know what i am talking about hehe ;)
"hey sorry if people are getting mad cause i am not answering text messages, these last two days have gone by really fast :p"
so far my week has been pretty boring.  let me know if you wanna <propfemale> out or something.
mysterious hooded man watches (from a disssstance!)
"not all of us girls can be the little size zero models on tv! seriously if anyone ever says you aren't beautiful don't believe them!  and frankly, i am not going to be anorexic just so i can be ""stunning"" by the world's standards. you girls out there are gorgeous and don't ever believe otherwise!"
"just finished applying basically everywhere i can for a job.  well, guess it's time to sit back and pray that someone wants to give me a job haha :p"
"is debating whether or not she should take some actual ballroom dancing classes........on the pros i might get to meet guys and i love ballroom dancing, on the cons i might have to suffer through a very busy summer and that might cut in on swimming.... :/"
coach <propfemale> wants to kill me in a painful way......with dryland. x(
the tango is.........very entertaining ;)

"my friends are insane.  in a good way, but still."
ahhhh! interview tonight!  i'm so excited!
"<propfemale> è orribile. e a volte va <propfemale> po 'troppo lontano con la vendetta.  i love spanish and it is an amazing language haha.  somehow all the words flow together and allow one to express one's true feelings.  it's amazing, but spanish 1020 is a real pain sometimes."
has a feeling tomorrow could either be really good or really bad.  well we shall see how the cookie crumbles.
so my day?  yeah it was both suckish and amazing.  how weird is that?  ah chicos son muy volubles haha
"social dance 2 is the best class ever!  i love my entire class and our routines are amazing.  now, if only i could find a partner for the routine we have to make up....."
"""now you'll never see, what you've done to me.  you can take back your memories they are no good to me, and here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes, with the sad sad look that you wear so well..............."""
pretty awesome dance.  gotta say i had a blast!
yeah i love the movie tangled....so adorable :d
yuck.  swimming is horrible when you suddenly go from easy workouts working on technique to grossly long sets working on stamina and speed.  not to mention a super hard dryland set that has given me blisters on my hands.......
"""we all have the fun-sized friend, the skinny friend that eats like a pig, the dirty minded friend, the retarded friend, the random friend, and the friend that is all the above...and sometimes it's you.""  personally i think i'm the fun-sized friend..what do you guys think you are ;)"
"just wants to say she loves her friends.  yes, all of them haha"
"so what are you wearing tomorrow: yellow, red, or green? ;)"
"ohhhhh crud. we have our choreographed performance for social dance tomorrow.  triple swing/lindy hop with the motorcycle, tabletop, around the world, and dip drops thrown in.  to a really fast song.  well let's see how well this goes...."
mmm.....taking some photos tonight with friends then idk what to do.  anyone wanna do something tomorrow?
:d today is going to be intresting to say the least.
could never eat something on epic meal time.  it would make me sick
"wow.  so.....sophmore year has been quite intresting.  other than me getting sick all the time it has been a lot of fun though.  social dance, lightsabers, friends, dances, drama, and all of that haha.  can't believe it's almost summer though....course that in itself brings more fun then school x)"
