every day seems grayer than the day before.
"treated myself to some consignment shopping, and then pizza. couldn't really finish it, though; its kinda hard to eat when your tummy is full of butterflies. ?_?"
"plugging-in and tuning-up. i've gotta change the strings today, though; so that kind of defeats the purpose. :p"
"is so pretty, oh, so pretty, vacant."

"my horoscope: just when you were sure you'd never, ever hear from them again, guess what? you'll see or hear from someone who'll mention that this particular missing person has been seen, and that they've mentioned your name. remember, when you're thinking of someone, it's often because they're thinking of you, too. prepare yourself to meet up with them, and don't pretend that you're not tickled when it happens."
"weather forecast for tonight: dark. continued dark overnight, with widely scattered light by morning."
is it fall yet? t.t
"my head is spinning, my heart is racing, my hands are shaking... i'm a nervous wreck."
this heat brings to mind a verse or two from a certain <propfemale> song from 1999 in which <propmale> <propfirst> did all the singing. o_x

spent the day organizing and updating media collection.
the infection has moved into my chest. [i've] been coughing like crazy all day.
"has had this overpowering urge to listen to live lately; who, i might add, are most certainly not a christian band. anyone who thinks that live is a christian band has obviously never listened to 'mental jewelry'."

could sure go for a game of chess right now; but i'm the only one in the house who knows how to play. so i guess i'll be playing against myself -- which wouldn't be so bad if i didn't keep losing track of which side's turn it is.

"my horoscope: don't hold back your feelings for a single second longer. everyone wants to hear all about them, especially the person who's inspired your happiness. besides, you're feeling so darned good, it's written all over your face. share the wealth. it's not fair to keep all that stuff to yourself. can't the rest of us have a little bit of it? so we can walk a mile in your glass slippers?"

save a drum -- bang a drummer.
half a <propfemale> (philosophically) must ipso-facto half not be. but half the <propfemale> has got to be vis-a-vee its entity. but can a <propfemale> be said to be or not to be an entire <propfemale> when half the <propfemale> is not a <propfemale> due to some ancient injury?

"if it pleases, i would like to wager $10 us on the following scenario: 2012 comes. 2012 goes. the world is fine. nobody dies. nothing even remotely catastrophic happens. and the history channel files for bankruptcy for buying into this lunacy in the first place."

"playing some more of those motherfucking covers that i can't seem to shake off, like a fucking cancerous disease."
capitalism tries for a delicate balance: it attempts to work things out so that everyone gets just enough stuff to keep them from getting violent and trying to take other people’s stuff.
"i've got my halloween costume all figured out. (ah, yes; my foresight has always been legendary.) i'm going as <propfirst> ramone! <propfemale> is indeed a punk rocker."
"needs to conjure up some stiff motivation and attack my bedroom with a broom and duster. i don't know what it is about my little slice of paradise (sarcasm) that makes me put my spring cleaning off until fall, but it is definitely taxing for my allergies."

"now, i don't really believe in this kind of stuff, but a thought just struck me: what if aig, big pharma, and their like are the ""antichrist?"" i'm serious about this. i challenge anyone to give revelations a good flip-through to see if i'm right. which i usually am."
