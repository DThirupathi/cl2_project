"doesn't make much sense, does it??: homeless go without eating. elderly go without needed medicines. mentally ill go without treatment. troops go without proper equipment. veterans go without benefits that were promised. yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first. 1% will re-post and 99% won't. have the guts to re-post this. i know i'm in the 1%"
