"""i've spun an elaborate web out of my life in the hopes of catching an occasional glimpse of you and your friend in the hallway.""- <propfirst> <3 you are my idol"
"yorkie, it's not for girls"
i's tired of looking for reasons when there aren't any left to be found
was technically only at 1 1/2 classes today
"<3 inside my head your voice is still resounding, but what can i do? empty rooms feel cold when i'm so used to being with you. <3"
let's get wrecked on poptarts and sex and see the taj-mahal. <3 ;)
"what if it was you? you that i needed all along. i felt like a fool, kicking and screaming and pretending we were wrong. <3 motion city soundtrack"
"cheer up and dry your damp eyes, and tell me when it rains.and i'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins.cause your heart has a lack of color and we should have known.that we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone. <3 owl city"
"perfect examples of how opposites don't attract, they just ruin eachothers lives"
lol best parade night ever :p
needs her glue sticks :p
just got a nosebleed getting out of the shower. i got dressed one-handed though so its all good (y) >:(
"last night i fell in love without you. i waved goodbye to that heart of mine, beating solo on your lawn"
"the only verdict is vengence; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me v."
"i can figure out the point of anything  just not as quick as i can mess up my life. with all my dreams hooked to hospital machines, i think, ""lets try redefining beautiful."""
"<3 if you cut me i suppose i would bleed, the colours of the evening stars. you can go wherever you wish, cause i'll be there, wherever you are. <3"
+ alexa-backpack <propmale> yellowpants + hot french guys having a pushup competition + completley hammered guy in the girls washroom= almost perfect night <3 :p
"i can figure out the point of anything just not as quick as i can mess up my life. with all my dreams hooked to hospital machines, i think, ""lets try redefining beautiful."""
"umm wow, thnx...?"
"my brother got his g1 :p hes driving like a grandma down the road :) but a grandma who has their license, don't worry ;)"
"so one day he found her crying, coiled up on the dirty ground. her <propmale> finally came to save her, and the rest you can figure out . but it was a trick, and the clock struck 12. <3"
has to find another jacket for tonight because two douchebags stole her other one >:(
tries to follow her heart but her head just won't shut up for long enough :p
"i thought i saw a sign, somewhere between the lines but maybe it's me, maybe i only see what i want.i still have your letter, just got caught between someone i just invented, who i really am and who i've become. <3"
"if your heart wears thin i will hold you up, and i will hide you when it gets too much. i'll be right beside you, i'll be right beside you. i will stay, nobody will break you. trust in me, trust in me, don't pull away. <3 beside you- marianas trench"
take that flute! damn straight finally made a sound :) my life is complete
"got her hair done, its not gross looking anymore :) listening to oldies night on the radio :d"
"if you want to play it like a game well, come on, come on, let's play. cause i'd rather waste my life pretending than have to forget you for one whole minute."
"the longer i hide behind these lies,the more i disintegrate. so much to say, but no words to convey; the loneliness building with each passing day. but i never get used to it, you just have to live with it."
"may be going to see ""where the wild things are...?"""
"can you take me back to the person i used to be, back when you were there for me. i know it seems like forever but do me a favor please, way back when we were stupid, held grudges just to help us sleep. oh my god, how ridiculous were we?"
how could it have gotten this bad between us...
"the longer i hide behind these lies,the more i disintegrate. so much to say, but no words to convey; the loneliness building with each passing day. but i never get used to it, you just have to live with it."
"it seems like everyday i end up doing something wrong. so fine, i give up. everything will probably work out better without me anyways."
"i don't mean to run. but every time you come around i feel more love than ever. and i guess it's too much, maybe we're too young and i don't even know what's real. but i know i never wanted anything so bad. i've never wanted anyone so bad."
"i don't mean to run. but every time you come around i feel more love than ever. and i guess it's too much, maybe we're too young and i don't even know what's real. but i know i never wanted anything so bad. i've never wanted anyone so bad."
