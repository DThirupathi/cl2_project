"love vs sex...a teenage girl about 17 had gone to visit some friends one evening and time passed quickly as each shared their various experiences of the past year. she ended up staying longer than planned, and had to walk home alone. she wasn't afraid because it was a small town and she lived only a few blocks away. as she walked along under the tall elm trees, <propfemale> asked god to keep her safe from harm and danger. when she reached the alley, which was a short cut to her house, she decided to take it. however, halfway down the alley she noticed a man standing at the end as though he was waiting for her. she became uneasy and began to pray, asking for god's protection. instantly a comforting feeling of quietness and security wrapped round her, she felt as though someone was walking with her. when she reached the end of the alley, she walked right past the man and arrived home safely. the following day, she read in the newspaper that a young girl had been raped in the same alley just twenty minutes after she had been there. feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and the fact that it could have been her, she began to weep. thanking the lord for her safety and to help this young woman, she decided to go to the police station. she felt she could recognize the man, so she told them her story. the police asked her if she would be willing to look at a lineup to see if she could identify him. she agreed and immediately pointed out the man she had seen in the alley the night before. when the man was told he had been identified, he immediately broke down and confessed. the officer thanked <propfemale> for her bravery and asked if there was anything they could do for her. she asked if they would ask the man one question. <propfemale> was curious as to why he had not attacked her. when the policeman asked him, he answered, ""because she wasn't alone. she had two tall men walking on either side of her."" amazingly, whether you believe or not, you're never alone. did you know that 98% of teenagers will not stand up for god? repost this as love vs. sex if you truly believe in god. ps: god is always there in your heart and loves you no matter what and if you stand up for him he will stand up for you. i bet 93% of the people that read this wont repost it. i read this and reposted it. well i bet you read this note because of the title, didn't you? read and believe. :)"
