it's so awkward when you add someone who has the same name as the guy that you were trying to add and then you find out that he's not the dude you want. awkward.

there were so many things in our lives that we have said. but none of them was that magical three words.
i tried to die today. i failed. why? cos i got too tired to do anything anymore.
i am obsessed with psychological mangas. i have no idea why.
"i'm scared.....of people who can smile, even though they don't mean it. as if to cover up the scars of their heart....they pretend it's not there."
