the girl you just called fat? she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs. the boy you just called stupid? he has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night. the girl you called ugly? she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her. the boy you just tripped? he is abused enough at home. there's a lot more to people than you think. put this as your status if you're against bullying.
