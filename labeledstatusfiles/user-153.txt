"such a beautiful day and feeling so good i'm going to start my new years resolutions today!an afternoon of maths (which i'm actually looking forward to!!) followed by breakfast at tiffanys with a bag of seedless grapes, but first a walk in the sunshine! :)"

"wonders why the java book has a picture of an inca sacrificing <propfemale> on it, although it does seem very fitting and i'm starting to think may also be preferrable -and i doubt it would be drawn out over 10 long weeks"
"happy new year to everybody, hope it's the best yet :)"
"right that's enough walking for one week now that i have two! blisters on my feet :/but, i did have such a good thought while i was out - how good would it be to live on a barge boat next year!!holiday time i would just untie the boat and float off down the river - i wonder how much it would cost.. :)"

"edinburgh is such a beautiful city, but a bit spooky and going on a ghost tour of the vaults and dungeons late at night probably wasn't the best thing to do..."
"special request to all kids returning to school in the next few weeks. if you see someone who is struggling to make friends or being bullied because they don't have many friends or because they are shy or not as pretty or not dressed in the most ""in"" clothes, please step up. say hi or at least smile at them in the hallway. you never know what that person might be facing outside of school. your kindness might just make a big difference in someone's life!! ~ help stop the bullying by re-posting"
"rather fed up with these ""cancer awareness facebook statuses"". why? cause they do nothing to raise awareness. the ugly face of cancer isn't some joke about bras or make people think you're pregnant- it's the loss of loved ones, uncertainty, and destruction of your body in chemo. want to help? go and offer to drive someone to chemo, have a chat to someone you know who's suffering next time or just donate a quid to mcmillan. this is raising awareness!"
