what is the difference between red and blue?  the question is odd but if you ask different people you would get different answers.  ie. someone from an inner city might say the difference between red and blue is wich group is shooting at you.  ask neo and he might say the difference is  either satying in wonderland or getting a good nights sleep.

"what is time? i mean really can you describe to me time without using synonyms for way to measure it? ie. a period, moment, second minute hour etc... even things like an observance is not accurate because there does not have to be an observer on mars for time to pass there.  so what is it?"

"just thought i'd pass on some totally useless, yet amusing trivia about critters: a pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes. (o.m.g.!!!) a cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death. (creepy. i'm still not over the pig.) the male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. the female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off. (<propfemale>, i'm home . what the...?) the flea can jump 350 times its body length. it's like a human jumping the length of a football field. (30 minutes. lucky pig! can you imagine?) the catfish has over 27,000 taste buds. (what could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond?) some lions mate over 50 times a day. (i still can't believe that pig ...quality over quantity.) butterflies taste with their feet. (something i always wanted to know.) elephants are the only animals that cannot jump. (okay, so that would be a good thing.) a cat's urine glows under a black light. (i wonder how much the government paid to figure that out.) an ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. (i know some people like that.) starfish have no brains. (i know some people like that, too.) polar bears are left-handed. (talk about a southpaw.) humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. (what about that pig? do the dolphins know about the pig?) now that you've smiled at least once, it's your turn to spread these crazy facts. (and god love that pig)"
