"so.. you people out there that are workin on characters for my story, take your time but i would like to start compiling at least a basic profile for the characters so that i can go more in depth for my plot. if you could get me the basic info at least, that be great"

"workin on the map of one of the worlds in my story. i got 20 some cities, and only thought of 2 names.. ideas?"

"so, if a giant yellow blueberry sang a song that sounded like grapes and had hands made of ""twinkle twinkle little <propfemale>"" and had a hat made of cow feet and was sitting next to me on a spaceship to jupiter, i would give it a high five and eat its fingers... :-)"

"now i remember why i dislike the majority of people. is it a commandment of god to have friends? cause i doin just fine without them. and yes, i do have some friends, but how much do almost any of you really know about me? not that people try very hard"
"mosiah 29:10 and now let us be wise and look forward to these things , and that which will make for the peace of this people."
"1nephi 15:23-24  (23)and they said unto me: what meaneth the <propmale> of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?   (24) and i said unto them that it was the word of god; and whoso would hearken unto the word of god, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction"
so what would happen if the tvs of everyone who is watching the superbowl just turned off and wouldnt turn back on??
"hmm... i dont recomend anyone try that. jus sat through 40 minutes of my 4, i mean 8, year old sister screaming and wailing. why? cause she didnt want to read 3 verses of scripture. is it wrong that i laughed after she got spanked?"
