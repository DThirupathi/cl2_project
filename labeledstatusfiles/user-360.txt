"lost two more cadets and a seed today. i had to help some guys get to the infirmary so i'm getting ready to try and find the <propfirst> to get more supplies for the nurses. and i dearly miss the cooking back home ._. i've been spoiled with coming home to a warm meal waiting for me. any news on your end? and are you sure you don't want me to take a day trip, yuna fayth suzuki?"
"i wish our uniforms were warmer ._. i'm freezing my ass off. they tell me that i'm going to be up and out on the field at 6 am until '??' since i'm on night watch again until 11 (they're letting me sleep tonight!), maybe yuna fayth suzuki could give me a call and let me talk to the kids and her...?"
"going to sleep in 3 minutes!! i want sleep sooooo badly. though, it was really nice talking to yuna fayth suzuki, lennon and <propfemale>. see you guys the 3rd!!"
*bangs head against wall* i....can't....sleep...
going to try and sleep...or at least just lay in bed. x_x
"pssssst, did you know that tidus ahh <propfirst> is a dickless ass?"
"as requested by yuna fayth suzuki. an update.well, today as i was out on the field and a swarm of unicorns made of chocolate rained down. i was surrounded by these chocolate fiends; it looked as though i was done for. but someone across the field cast firagra and melted the unicorns. i still don't know who my savior is, i believe he was a giant glittering turtle."
"okay, seriously now.three more guys were killed today; two more injured. i've been out on the field all day fighting and i'm tired as hell. and they tell me that friday-sunday i'm doing re-con and leading an invasion. please, try not to worry anymore, yuna fayth suzuki, but that means no calling/texting or anything with me this weekend."
"well, last night i gave a certain girl a surprise visit. i thought that since i won't be able to talk with her this weekend i might as well come visit. had a very fun night with yuna fayth suzuki. i took the longest shower when i got up <3 it feels great to be home."
"the invasion was a complete success; in fact, it was so successful that i'm coming home thursday. that's right, i'm coming home the 24th!! can't wait to be able to sleep well, eat good food and be awakened by kids jumping on my bed. i'll be home 8 days earlier, good news, yuna fayth suzuki?"
"così, ho adottato <propfemale> bambino italiano ... il suo nome è apparentemente itay. così i thats <propfemale> altro ragazzo <propfemale> mia l<propfemale>ga lista dei bambini."
what have i missed? when did <propfemale> <propfemale> leonhart grow up so much? i am such a terrible parent ._.
"okay, sora strife-awaiosonoankoku...maybe it is a bad idea to allow denzel awaiosonoankoku to watch metalocalypse................."
"apparently, if mine and yuna fayth suzuki's relationship doesn't work...cløud strife-fair is going to snap my <propmale> off ._."
"night all, going to sleep with my beautiful girlfriend yuna fayth suzuki. <3"

"unicorns eat hummus for their metabolism and tortillas for horn upkeep/growth. and they only share their food with their mates. right, yuna fayth suzuki-leonhart? and mermaidunicorns exist."
"my exam went by fast, me and the cadets got some training in, quistis gave the tour for me, the meeting for the festival was postponed, irvine said he had the studying under control, i went over zell's paper, one class was canceled because the instructor called in sick at the last minute and the other classes went by fast. it's good being home early."

"...well...the mission to dollet turned out to be an assassination attempt plotted by sephiroth...well, nice to know he wants me dead..."
i feel so drained.
back in my dorm at garden; working on reports and studying.
<-- doing homework.
nothing lasts in this world. someday you're bound to lose everything. everybody around you will be gone. then what are you left with? nothing. nobody... it's so miserable. and it's inevitable. it's so hard to recover from something like that. i never ever want to deal with that again. i can't. even if it means being alone...
"//well, since sephirøth awaiosonoankoku killed me, i suppose i'm off to bed!"
"when tomorrow starts without me, and i’m not there to see,if the sun should rise and find your eyes all filled with tears for me;i wish so much you wouldn’t cry the way you did today,while thinking of the many things we didn’t get to say.i know how much you care for me, and how much i care for you,and each time that you think of me i know you’ll miss me too;"
is finally back.
"yuna fayth suzuki-leonhart, i want to marry you today :3 i love you that much. you make me such a softy! :3"
is choosing to be the adult and ignoring sephirøth awaiosonoankoku.
._. i sense cat-fights in my near future...
"me e yuna fayth suzuki-leonharta sono andare in italia, per gentile concessione di sephirøth awaiosonoankoku. così, ho deciso ho bisogno di rispolverare il mio italiano."

"//goodnight.yuna fayth suzuki-leonhart, you need to be going to sleep. you are sick. get your rest."
"...rena-lynette leonhart is my daughter, of course she's my daughter...she's mine and reno <propmale> atakawashi-shinra daughter...rufus shinra isn't her father...of course he's not..."

"!depression alert! i, squall leonhart, 'main' character of final fantasy viii, one of the most hated ff's, am depressed that vii got a prequel/sequel and a movie, x got a sequel, and some other ff's got remakes. and now, after living in the ever looming shadow of vii, it seemed as though one game out-shined vii, and that was xiii. and now, xiii is getting a sequel. ._. i think i'm dying."
"well, mission briefing is over. the ever moronic irvine kinneas and zell dincht decided to go out drinking. i'm staying back at hq and studying on the mission. hopefully i can sleep tonight, early day tomorrow. and i'm going to try to keep you updated, yuna fayth suzuki, so you won't worry so much."
