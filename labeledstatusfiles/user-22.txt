-an opened letter- find time to reread my letter. a vision of truth and of anger. believing might be a deception of coins. your treasured ignorance of that sort. like a letter that you opened. that is literally not yours.
waaaaah
-falling- it was like falling into the deep abyss. remembering how dark life is without a light. can't sleep with all those nightmares coming back. like a dead coming back to life. breathing and drowning in the heavy water. fleeing away from the world of laughter. crying until my eyes went dead. sleeping until insomnia attacks my head. will you forgive me for giving you a pain in the head?
ano ang nasa isip mo..?
back to normal na ba??
say what you need to say before it's too late...
"if you are alone, i'll be your shadow. if you want to cry, i'll be your shoulder. if you're not happy, i'll be your smile. if you need me, i'll always be there."

"-curious roses- what they say, it doesn't matter. as long as you have this one special thing. as long as you know you're doing it for something. pride will close its doors. new fingers will touch yours. look pass those stupid daisies. you'll see a dozen curious roses. laying its hand for you. finding time just to be with you. curious roses. please, let me know if it's you."
"-curious roses 2- what they say, it doesn't matter. as long as you have this one special thing. as long as you know you're doing it for something. picture a scene of the sea. wait me until september three. call a thousand graceful fairies. tell them to tell fascinating stories. i’ll be thinking of you and i’ll. find time... just to be with you. curious roses. please, let me know if you’re here for sure."
i have to see how the story ends...
"-jigsaw- find the missing part of a jigsaw puzzle. it might be somewhere, look harder. it might be hidden somewhere in your drawer. or you might have lost it while walking farther. worry about it while it isn't over. because i'll throw it away if i find it later. so you would find me instead of that stupid puzzle."
... *sigh* <propfemale> bakasyon na. para kasama ko na mga friends kooooo!!! tas shot na! haha. joke. >x)
"move on, but don't move away."
compromise rather than confront.
-tulog- tumatakbo ang kahapon. umuurong na ang mga alon. luluhod <propfemale> ba ang mga dahon? oras di sinasadyang matapon. gabing wala ng <propfemale>g-asang bumangon.
"lahat ng nawala ay may kapalit pero di lahat ng kapalit ay katumbas ng nawala sa'yo.  iibahin <propfemale> nito ang bagay na pinahalagahan mo, babaguhin <propfemale> nito ang takbo ng buhay mo pero hindi para palitan ang bagay na nagpapermanente ng pagkatao mo. -mj"
breathing..
"-curious roses 3- listen. what they say, it doesn't matter. as long as you have this one special thing. as long as you know you're doing it for something. then maybe these roses won’t be curious anymore."

"human philosophy: why do we always reject those who loves us and love someone who doesn't love us in the first place? answer: unconsciously, we enjoy being hurt.."
"cos if one day you wake up and find that your missing me, and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i can be, thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet, and you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street."
-insomnia- di makatulog kinakabahan baka mahulog sa hinihigaan magigising walang pakiramdam parang lasing katinuan nasaan?
"if you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame."
