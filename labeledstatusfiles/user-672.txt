facebook is becoming unbelievably crap. this new facebook chat is glitchy as fuck and the whole site visually is displeasing to the eyes. they seem to think they are making things better for users when in fact they are just making things worse and more complicated. >_>
what is it with celebrities and giving their children retarded names? harper seven beckham. really?!
so full of shit...why are people just so full of shit?!
is waiting to go for a blood test. i hate needles! >_<

"we wa we wa. <propmale> in the castle, <propmale> in the castle!"
"cake attack! nom, nom!"
"this zenos shit looks hardcore! >_< but i'm going to try have to get past the interview and assessment process first. another mathematics assessment. joy, it's the thing i am worst at in the world... =/"
danny: this song is called entangled. it's about you.    me: how?   danny: because every night i wake up entangled in your hair! lol. <3
only one of us walks away...
i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does.
all i have is all that you've given me. did you ever worry that i've come to depend on you? i gave you all the love i had in me and now i find you lie and i can't believe it's true. wrapped in her arms i see you across the street and i can't help but wonder if she knows what going on. you talk of love but you don't know how it feels when you realize that you're not the only one.
"yo man, fuck man!"
so stuffed i probably won't even be able to walk after this. only waddle! d =
munch munch! hurhur. =)
it's oooon!!
"there's something in my pocket, for you! why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is?"
zenos assesment tomorrow. this better go well or i won't be happy. =/ damn you mathematics! my sworn enemy... ¬_¬
"i got through! failed the maths assessment by 1 <propfirst> but because my grades were so good they let me through to interview! so if i pass this interview next week i'm through. whoop, whoop! =]"
this spicy chicken cous cous and sultana thing is really not hitting the spot. can't deal with people ruining yummy cous cous with disgusting dried fruit. it should be a sin!
why is a little peace and happiness always too much to ask for?
"some people make me so angry. the human race needs a serious purging to get rid of all the superficial, stuck up, snobbish, selfish and inconsiderate people that are out there that care only about themselves and their own happiness. i want nothing to do with people like that and the world would be a lot better without them."
"i'm going to give myself high blood pressure one of these days! calm tannie, nice tannie. smiley happy times good, mass murder bad!"
i like my beats fast and my bass down low!
"the wolf man, the lion man and now there's a croc man? are these people being serious? >_>"
"i'm tired, boss. tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. tired of not ever having me a <propmale> to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. mostly i'm tired of people being ugly to each other. i'm tired of all the pain i feel and hear in the world everyday. there's too much of it. it's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. can you understand? ~ <propfirst> coffey [the green mile]"
okay seriously people! what is this shit about there being riots in slough? is this actually true or are people making this shit up and if so where is it happening?
i can't believe it. just saw a comment from a girl who is trying to say the london riots were all done by black people. what a generalization! so all black people are criminals? if i recall when <propfirst> <propfirst> made his statement the police officer guarding 10 downing street was a black man. only an idiot would make such a ridiculous and inacurate comment. what a stupid bitch!
