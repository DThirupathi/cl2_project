i just felt a sudden wave of brian-sadness. i don't think a day goes by still that i don't think about him. i miss him so much. :[
i feel like befriending all of the <propfirst> carpenter's on facebook. just because. xd
it's okay... he's my ex...
woohoo! relaxation time for <propfirst>. i feel like i have been on my feet for days.
can't wait until i have enough money to get my moped. :] cars are so overrated.
oh lord. desperate housewives makes me laugh out loud.
"just wasted a day of her life doing nothing, and it felt good."
really? i don't have to do all of these worksheets that take three hours a chop from my life for driving? i wish i had known that three worksheets ago. :/
"'is he bold?' ""no on braver!"" 'is he sweet?' ""our favorite flavor!"""
and now i'm 18.001 years old. cheers! :]
yummy noodles! :3
"""dad, there's a scorpion on the bathroom ceiling!"" 'okay.' ""aren't you going to get it?!"" 'i'm not getting out of bed!' ... i guess that little bugger will live to scare another innocent bathroom-goer. touche."
no sleeping for <propfirst> since <propfirst> can't risk missing the plane... x.x
yay for unusual sleeping patterns? or...not.
"someone should just give me a 250cc moped. like, 'here, <propfirst>, i got this moped for you.' the most natural thing in the world, right?"
going to the galleria! xd i wish i had more money to spend there.
hope everyone is having fun getting chubbers. :]
pissed. off. i'm tired of this crap.
why is it so difficult to get someone to take an hour to teach me to parallel park?? this is so frustrating.
only five more days in kokomo... how depressing. :[ better make them last. :]
"for those who don't know, i lost my phone. x.x so sorry if i don't text back."
"i hate when you dream about people you're mad at, especially when your dream self isn't mad at them. it makes my head hurt, and makes me sad. stupid dream-people."
"wants to be social. i hate being stuck with the choices of walking or bicycling. just shoot me now, yeah?"
yay for popping my own healthy popcorn and sneaking it into theaters. :d boo for high fat theater-popped popcorn.
club mixes make me want to jam out.
ugggh. hypocrisy infuriates me.
hates getting the car on empty when she's broke.
"so, i just bought my very first item off of ebay ever, and i have to say i feel a little more accomplished. x3"
"""can he swing from a web? no he can't, he's a pig."""
getting my phone today! everybody send me <propfirst> so i can re-add them? :]
picture comment frenzy! :d
yay! new phone! :d time to explore it.
"haha, i'm starting to like shopping on ebay a little too much."
i thought i was at the bottom step and fell off the stairs. not my brightest moment.
"when it's this hard and expensive to get tickets to see my friends perform, they better know that i freakin' love 'em. ugh."
it's days like this one that make me really dislike working.
lost my phone. <propfemale>'s pictures. :[ i can't believe i lost my phone.
"i want to watch lost in space. why do you fail me, netflix?!"
my phone might have just died the final death. t-t

"i would just like to take a second to thank whoever it was that was cleaning sunland park mall last night, found my wallet, and turned it into security so i could find it today! you're my hero!it's nice to know there are some nice people out there, too. (:"
aaaaaaa my interview for disney doesn't start until 6:30 but i keep jumping every time the phone rings as if they decided to call forty minutes early. so nervous. dx
