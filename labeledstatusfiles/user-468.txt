q. why are some people so ignorant? i honestly feel embarrassed for them.
take my quiz but don't take the results too seriously . . .it is for entertainment purposes only.
got any funny or embarrassing period stories?
argh why is it when daddy is away the children will drive me insane!!!!! little schala just keeps screaming for her daddy and there is no consoling her . . . .
i'm going to bed i swear!
i feel a whole lot better and my hair doesn't look that bad (its beiberesce). i watched comedy central and had an awesome day with my wonderful children who think i am beautiful no matter what. :)
i cannot wait til the midnight showing of deathly hallows! i will have my wand at the ready. (:
thought of the day: if your actions are just there is no need to justify them. second thought: if you are a good person; the opinions of others is irrelevant
"may fleets of fairies wisk me away tonight, happy night <3"
what an exhausting day so tired need to relax!!!!!
i gotta go to the grocery store.
is lonely because old fart <propfirst> went to bed as soon as i got home..... :(
is thinking about maybe going home early . .migraine :/

"just playing the mama no no game with my baby. lots of fun! she is a wondrous, militant midget. she loves giving corporal punishment and she is a nudist! wow this is starting to sound like a fem dom ad on craigslist.*awkward pause* do you have a nudist child in the family? if so please let me know what you do to keep them dressed. thank you."
ohayo gozaimasu

"while you scream at your woman, there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear. while you humiliate, offend, and insult her, there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is. while you hurt her, there's a man wishing he could take her pain away. while you make her cry, there's a man stealing smiles from her. -thanks <propfirst>"

warning: morbid status update. i smell a dead body stench coming from a neighboring apartment building. its getting worse to the point of nearly making me blow chunks on the sidewalk. i seriously doubt that i only notice this. what would you do in this situation? there is a possibility that there has beena murder. there is also a possibility that someone just bit the dust.
i'm not one to judge-----------distances very well.. :/
so maybe i am not one of those pretty girls at all but at least i have more than just a dial tone in my head.

i love my crazy family <3

i finally got rid of that abhimanyu jerk. no thanks to facebook! i had to re-friend him just to tell him off for blowing up my cell at all hours...then facebook wouldn't let me block him for another 48 hrs for some cruel unknowable reason...your 48 hrs are up. :)
so disappointed with facebook right now..i tried to put that i was in a relationship with myself but it rudely told me that i cannot create a relationship with myself...narrow!
