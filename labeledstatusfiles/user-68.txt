"hun, if it sparkles, has no fangs, yet claims to be a vampire, it's not a vampire... it's a faerie, but a disgrace to faeries and vampires everywhere."
"i personally believe in jesus christ. one facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall. the bible says, if you deny me in front of your peers, i will deny you in front of my father. this is a simple test. if you love god and you are not afraid to show it. re post this. (i did it with pride!)"
i made the mistake of letting <propfemale> have my phone ;)
"okay, the trade joes over on haven is the most amazing place ever. i'm totally going to apply for a job there :)"
totally forgot to keep doing that 30 day photo challenge. got to day 3 and then just stopped. but i'm continuing now :)
musical guest onerepublic on conan tonight. i always knew conan was awesome:)
"i'll be <propfemale>, you'll be <propmale>. slap!"
"chillin in my room with <propfemale>, slices of cucumber, a cup of tea (i just read that with an english accent in my mind), and watching the dark knight.yes. my life is just that amazing. be jealous ;d"
i wish disney and non-disney kids movies were made like they were back when we were little. i think this newer generation would've turned out a whole lot better if they did. but that's just my opinion...
"it's so cold outside, that i've lost the feeling in my fingers. i don't suppose this is a good thing."
archery today at 2. i'm totally going to make a fool of myself :d
"i was putting my hair up in a ponytail using the same band i had used earlier. only i couldn't find it, so i spent like ten minutes going crazy looking for it. when i finally gave up and used a different band, i found the original. on my wrist. -.-"
i think i should change my name. you may now call me <propmale> :d
"*in the flower section at lowes*me: i like how it smells out here. it smells so clean and pretty.grams: it's called fresh air marqi.me: -.- everytime. i swear."
oh. my. goodness. i'm going to cut my hair like <propmale> jareth's :)
"tori: 1- 2- 3- 4- 6!grams: you missed 5! 5 comes after 4 and then 6.tori: no 6!grams: no 5. it's 5 sweetie, grandma knows best.me: yes, because arguing with a two year old clearly means that. kudos to you."
"me: everytime i stretch, i feel like a cat.grams: are you a vicious <propfemale>?me: if provoked, yes. which is also code for stop friggin poking me!!"
"""no no no no no n- no! you stupid crap monkey! don't jump downwards, that's just stupid. aw you're dead now! see what you've done? i hope your happy."" -me, yelling at my computer while playing assassin's creed 2."
"okay, amnesia? very, very stressful. oh god. invisible mosters are going to eat me. no, no, i'm alright. i am calm. phew."
"oh. so you can now breed sheep in farmville. what a delightfully pleasant upgrade... can you even call it an upgrade?i don't know."
"hah! i've done it! i've done it! i have completed amnesia. god i am so proud of myself. well done, me. well done."
"at revolve right now. if you see me, my name is <propfemale> and i'm from winchester, new england :d just a little fyi there. ;)"
ohmlawrdd!! i breathed the same air as hawk <propmale>!!! :d i can die very very happily now :)
so apparently i am the love child of ozzie osbourne and <propfirst> brand. how friggin amazing is that?! :d
once again i have left my phone out in the open and will now suffer the consequences.
"""modest is hoddest ;)"" -<propfirst>, hawk <propmale>"
"because of tobuscus, i now have an imaginary friend named <propfirst>. :)"
"i wish there was a ""poke all"" button. poking 15-20 people one at a time isn't what i'd call convenient."
"i've got nothing to say, but i haven't done a status for about a day or two so i figured i should before someone thinks i've dropped off the face of the earth.obviously, i think i'm just that important :d"
"seeing <propfirst> tomorrow :)it might be a good idea to get some sleep before then... then again, this is me we're talking about here."
hah! so i just found out that obama is not invited to the <propmale> wedding. i don't know why but this makes me extremely satisfied. it must be like a personal insult to him. :p
happy easter everybody! stay safe and have fun ;)
"if you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague."
"oh, how i do enjoy scientific discussions :)"
"oh my goodness! okay, so my dog hurt her leg so i had to wrap it in gauze so she wouldn't keep licking it and stuff. well now she's limping around and acting seriously injured. what makes it funny is that she could walk just fine before i put the bandage on: she's totally milking it."
"grams: what day is today?me: <propfemale> on. let me consult my psychic socks. *looks at the bottom of foot* they say it's wednesday.grams: you are the strangest child i have ever raised.me: they also say i should receive my check from you today.grams: ...i shouldn't have bought you those stupid socks."
"dear gamestop,kindly go jump off a <propmale> and quit screwing me over.sincerely, a very pissed off customer."
"wetzel's pretzels :dneed i say more?"
"in honor of the big wedding on friday, use your <propmale> wedding guest name this week. start with either lord or lady. your first name is one of your grandparents' names. your surname is the name of your first pet, then ""of"" followed by the name of the street you grew up on. just for fun, let's do this! post yours here. then cut and paste it into your status: lady skeet <propfemale> of <propfemale>."
"my dog is experiencing the effects of ""the cone of shame"" firsthand."
<propfirst> patton is so cute! he's like a big <propmale> bear!!! and has a smile that looks like this :d
"okay, um, honestly? i hate it when there's like a butt-load of people online, but it's never that one person you so desperately want to talk too."
i love how i have the ability to unabashedly say out out loud what's on everyone else's mind :d
"because of chuckie from rugrats, i spent my entire childhood thinking that if i ate a black watermelon seed, a watermelon was going to start growing inside of me. those of you who know me, probably won't find this surprising at all :d"
i love how <propfirst> stark's little talking computer guy can totally pull off the whole sarcasm thing.
"like my status and i'll tell you1. how we met-2. my first impression of you-3. what i like about you-4. my favorite memory of you-5. if you liked this, make it your status so i can like yours also :)"
"i've just discovered that yelling at your computer when it misbehaves, really does make it work again."
people say i should have my brain scanned. i say they might find something they've never seen before. my grandma says they probably won't see anything. i say there must be something in my head since i can sometimes hear it rattling. but it could also be that dime i stuck in my ear a few days ago.
"i want to apologize for the link i shared (which fyi, wasn't actually me) ignore it, delete it etc. just don't get mad at me cause i don't know what happened."
"""love is what i got, it's within my reachyeah, and the sublime style's still straight from long beachit all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deservetry and test that, you're bound to get servedlove's what i got, don't start a riotyou'll feel it when the dance gets hot"" -what i got by sublime"
"connections and shopping for a prom dress tomorrow. it should be a fairly busy day, so i should probably get some shut eye. but you know what? i'm not tired. so take that sleep. we'll talk when i'm dead :p"
frozen strawberry lemonade= eternal happiness :)
the nordstrom's in the montaclair mall has their own flipping cafe! new goal: become <propmale> so i can afford nordstrom's.
"what to do when you're in trouble? remain calm and call batman, of course! :dtoday's moment of wisdom and helpful advice brought to you by <propfemale> fairchild, with a little help from yours truly ;)"
so i'm stuck in the waiting room at san <propfirst> hospital. what are some fun things to do while at a hospital? >:)
i hate it when i try to tell my grandparents a funny story and it turns into an hour long lecture or life lesson -.-
"gah, i am so sick and tired of your mixed signals! you'll never know how much you mean to me if you keep this up. stop playing with my heart, figure things out and then get back to me."
"let's see who truly reads my status. you and i wake up in psychiatric <propmale> together. using only four words, what would you say to me? note: if you comment you must copy and paste this to your status so i can comment on yours as well. be a good sport and play along. 4 words is harder than you think! this should be fun!!"
"""i suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal. when will we learn? when will we change? just in time to see it all come down. those left standing will make millions, writing books on the the way it should have been."""
"studying for the base test and i saw the math section... i'm freaking out. i hate math, i'm no good at it, and it looks like the biggest section out of the whole thing. ahhh just kill me now please :("
takers <3
and in this moment i am happy. i wish you were here :)
"wow. past midnight and 21 people are still online. you guys seriously have no better way to spend your friday nights? haha!that's okay. neither do i. ahem... yep... well isn't my hypocritical judgment just awkward? ^.^"
i'm thinking i should cut my hair short again. but i like my long hair. but i also like having short hair. ugh i don't know. what do you guys think?
"archery was awesome today! it's super tiring though :)bad news is, the range near my house might close at the end of next month. so i have to go all the way out to chino hills to shoot :("
"me: are you poking me with a french fry?!gramps: *sighs* dinner is never boring with you around, i can safely say that much."
"right when i get used to putting my hair up for the hot weather, it gets all cold and rainy again... i think god might be a <propmale> bipolar :p"
"my phone keeps telling me i have a new text message, but i really don't. my family says i have a crappy smartphone. i think it's delightfully evil; it enjoys watching my happiness dwindle down into nothing when i find out there's no new message. i mean, why else would they call it a smartphone?my family also says i watch too much syfy, but i don't have a clue as to what they're talking about ^.^"
"i don't understand why facebook gives us the option to like our own status'. i mean, we wrote it, of course we like it. why would we write something we don't like? leave it to facebook to create something somewhat useless."
"me: *watching lakers vs knicks* oh! he just totally ate it!!grams: of course you know what that feels like, don't you?me: -.-"
"it's getting colder, the last train is here, and it's leaving behind those here! these are the bad lands, the worst place to fear, making place for the ones we left here. they're calling, calling to say goodbye."
"everything's not okay. for the first time in years, i'm suddenly starting to realize that. please, please, oh god, someone please distract me before i go completly mental."
"""this is who i am. i come off as goofy and quirky and silly, but that's okay. i'm a happy person. what people see when they look at me is exactly what they get. but people still judge me based on who they think i am, and they don't exactly realize i am capable of serious conversation. well, that's not my problem, is it? people are missing out."""
why do things always have to be complicated?
