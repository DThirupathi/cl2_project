"if it's a snow day 2morrow (dont get your hopes up) people in the school play/ backstage people should go. we have the rehearsal 2morrow so u probably should be there. don't know if they'll cancel it, but it's the last day we have to rehearse it; were doing the shows on tues and weds...so pls come!!"
do you like my new profile picture? :p that was fun... we made a huge leaf pile that was taller than me!
i did my book talk today!!!! :( i hate oral presentations if for some strange reason you did not know. when there r lots of eyes on me i tend to go bonkers. that is why im so awful at oral presenstations. :(
is wanting people to post more things on her wall... facebook is boring if you don't say anything!!
i'm not exactly sure what goes with rememberance day...have a solemn rememberance day? have a happy one!!!??
"is surprised the school year already seems to be winding down. we've had no huge, <propmale> projects! and we've had n.h. for 2days. scary. grade 7 is coming up so fast!"
"happy summer everyone!! have an awesome summer of sleeping in, staying up late, relaxing, going swimming and being lazy!!!!"
"-you decide to watch people snow board down the hill across the street-after a minute you see a flimsy blue snowboard slide down it- no one on it-after a couple seconds you see a guy run down the hill after it and you laugh real hardwell, you have to profit somehow from a sizeable pile of dirt put in a park with people toboggoning down and screaming ""ahhhhhhhhhh!"" of which you can hear from across the street :p"
"today at school we had pizza, (thnx mme belaire!) we had cup cup cakes and little chocolate hearts, (thnx mme <propmale> oh and if we had mugs we had hot chocolate), and fun dip. (thnx maddy! :d) to top the day off we had v-day dance!! awesome day!!!!!:d"
is so releived and happy eqao is over!!!!!!
"i <3 <propfemale> kats!! :d crunchy, chocolatey goodness!!"
<propfemale> christmas every1!!!! :d
school count down: 13 !! :( d:
watching beauty and the beast and loooovvvveee the message in it!!:d never really appreciated it when i was younger. all those kid movies can reveal greater meetings when you get a bit older. now i realize that beauty and the beast isnt a kid movie; it's a classic with a great moral and meaning. :d
is wishing she had a pool or lake or something
school is on tuesday!!! :( d: :( :( :'(
"my mom told me that if anything shows up asking if you'd like a dislike button (for the different facebook posts, you know how there's a like button and a comment button) well if anything shows up asking if you'd like a dislike button, say no. it's a scam you can get a virus."
saw the 33rd (and last) miner from chile come out of the thingy they used to bring them out. my mom had found a website where you could see 30 seconds after it happened the progress of the chile project. i am so happy to know that they all came out and were all rescued and that they have now been reunited with their families and have been tended to after 2 months! must be so happy to be out of the mine!
"in mme <propmale>'s split class... people say that she has a temper and is a tough teacher... but so far, to be honest, i'm not finding her too bad! well, then again, it's not like anyone really did anything to provoke her today..."
report card day today... hope everyone's happy with their grades or percents :d
"it may seem kinda strange to a few people but one of my favourite movies of all time is beauty and the beast... so i can't wait until beastly comes out, cause it has the same sort of story line but not as fairytale like and not animated; it has real actors\ actresses"
is going to kalahari tomorrow!! :d
i got highlights!!!! :d :d :p :p :)
<propfirst> swift rocks!!!!:d (well for me she does xd) also <propfirst> clarkson's pretty awesome too
is getting a lot of homework (in general) and is getting really nervous about what the rest of the year will look like. i have a feeling the end of the year will be prreettty uggglyyy!
"i am counting down the days 'till school (and also dreading school, im not excited) so when you see a number as my status, that will be how many more days untill school starts.15 more days!!:(:("
doing sience fair prodject with <propfemale> vanveen :)
officially snow day 2morrow!! it's final! :d
"i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl...don't say yes, run away now! i'll meet you when you're out of the church, at the back door. don't wait, or say a single vow you have to hear me out, and they said speak now..."
fog day! :d
had a <propmale> bead spill :s almost finished cleaning it all up...:s
"feeliing soooooooooooooooo annoyed because i know  i wrote a journal entry for chapter 15 of the hobbit and i remember writing it but cant find it anywhere. i looked all over the house and started freaking out. so, lets just say its at schooll and if mme asks me where my journal entry for chapter 15 is and i cant find it at school i will tell her that its in my head but lost."
speeches coming up!!!!!!!!:s hate speeches with my entire being!! especially since they're in french...and i'm going 8th!! so jealous of those who are going like in the late 10s or early 20s in my class
"did my speech today. guess its nice to have it done and over with, although i did read like every other sentence from my q-cards (i had the majority of it memorized before, ok? i just kinda forget it when i got up there:p) but anywho now i dont have to work on my speech on top of studying for geo and history"
everyone watching super-bowl; but football doesn't exactly interest me...
i may sound crazy but i feel like having ice cream in mid winter!! :d at least my mom has sense; she doesnt want ice cream in winter
happy v-day :d
got a hair cut (mom this is the only thing i did today on the computer game-wise)
"and it was enchanting to meet youand all i can say is i was enchanted to meet youthis night is sparkling dont you let it goim wonderstruck blushing all the way homeill spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you! <3 -<propfirst> swift, enchanted"

"beastly was a pretty good movie, with the minor draw back of already knowing the story line. it's based on beauty and the beast"

"~if you trust me with secrets i will too. if you break that trust you arent getting it back and we cant be friends because real friends stay loyal and faithful to the end.~dont tell me something just because it will make me happy; tell me the absolute, honest truth. it just makes both our lives more complicated. i would rather you not say anything than tell me a lie. like this if you agree!"

"if you think you arent my friend or family, but you think you know me, check again. if you have never seen me go hyper or go crazy...you dont know me at all!"
