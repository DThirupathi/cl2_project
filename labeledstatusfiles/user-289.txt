"dear <propfemale>, my mother always told me the hardest things to do in life are to trust, to have faith and to forgive so i want you to hear the strength in my voice when i say i forgive you because i love you, that's simple and that complicated to forgive is to move forward <propfemale> rule, love mom - <propfemale> rule"

"he tried to take away all the things that would let you love me without being in my bed, like a friend or a father. this has everything to do with him. this is about knowing the difference between right and wrong, between the truth and a lie. he took that from you. and if you can't tell the difference, then you can't trust anyone. and if you can't trust, you can't love. - <propfemale> rule"

"i don't like riding down the highway seeing a fear of mine in a truck next to our car, only to push myself as far towards the car and try to get away from it, only to have it taunt me sticking it's snout out of the side of the truck!"

if this was a movie you'd be here by now
"i just don't feel like caring today, i just feel like burying myself in my shell and not coming out until i'm ready to act tough and deal with the world. i just want to be by myself and hide away, where i can wear my emotions on my sleeves and i don't have to worry about being happy for everyone else."
"if your not <propmale>, don't expect me to be <propfemale>"
"i didn't know local tv would play rammstein after 5:30am, or any time for that matter."

i wish this pain in my chest and shoulder would go away. it hurts to breathe and move at times.
"why is it almost everyone i know either had their nose or tongue pierced? i made sure none of my friends had it done when i got mine so mine wasn't following the crowd, now when i look around almost everyone has it done. i'd never get a piercing or tattoo cause someone else got it, my best friends tattoo won't even be the same as my best friends. quite simple people be yourself, cause nobody wants a carbon copy."
i find it kinda funny it's been over a year and no ninjas have broke into my house and stole my books or phone yet. lol sorry but your ninja is taking it's sweet time or coming up with some plan that's still taking time to figure out. p.s. either way my friend your ninja has failed! =d   ~lillies

watching the shining
"watching ""deadliest warrior"" yakuza vs. mafia, this is one interesting show."
sometimes telling someone what you think and feel is the hardest thing to ever do. sometimes i want to just put everything out there but i don't want to lose everything that means alot.

“yeah it’s true! and he’s really hot. it’s like he needs theme music that goes ‘bow-chicka wow-wow’ every time he walks into a room.” lol
"now that i think about it i don't think it's my feelings that has me caged in, i openly love and <propfemale>, i prove my love everyday by showing it instead of saying it, words are words that mean nothing if you can't put them into action. people's expectations are what has me caged in, and i refuse to be held back anymore by them."
"getting ready for a long, but awesome weekend and trying not to poke <propfirst>'s bruise."
i found a show about parkour. it's really cool
"it amazes me when a young lady open their mouths to sing and their voice is so big. like <propfemale> mccurdy (<propfirst> from icarly) i got chills when i listened to her cover of ""so far away"" by <propfemale> <propmale>, i never expected a voice like that to come from her."
"today is a great day, it was simply made by a 16 year old boy!"

"whenever i read a story there is always a piece of the characters that strikes my interest, and i either like them or i really don't. i can almost name the traits i love and the ones i don't."
just got back from walking with <propfirst> and my favorite 2 year old boy!
"to be honest i don't see what the big deal is with wanting a guy, i mean guys are not the way they used to be, it's rare to find a guy who follows his heart and thinks with his mind, instead of follows his hormones and thinks with his pants."
"pack, study, take test, finish packing,sleep, then leave."
"your not worth crying over, this smile is plastered on. =d"
"take my words and keep them close to heart. i will never fall for anybody for the rest of my life, it is not going to happen, never. i promise on it!"
"spending time out with my mom, enjoying her attention. :)"
yay avatar: the last airbender!
"i wish i had a car and money, i'd take off and go to washington. i'd sit on the beach and enjoy the ocean. i'd be free from everything for the moment, just enjoying time away with my thoughts."

yay i'm getting a ironman toy from burger <propmale>!
"i'm smarter then to believe that i need you, i'm smart enough to know if someone wants to be by your side they will find a way to do so and if they don't try then don't stress it, it's simply their loss"
"study, study, study thats my plans for the night."
"why yes i do dance around the dining room to <propfirst> timberlake's ""sexy back"" with people lol"

"and i don't know how it gets better than thisyou take my hand and drag me head first fearless"
sleep over at my sister's
"sometimes i miss the innocence of how life used to be, like when i was younger i was afraid of sleeping in a room alone afraid of what might happen so i used to  sneak into my brothers room and fall asleep between their beds, and there i felt safe like nothing could get me while i was asleep between my 2 big brothers."
"one of those days where i wish we had a car, i wanna get out of the house and go have fun somewhere."
"took meds for sinus infection and it hasn't helped at all. on top of the sinus problems i'm tired, jittery, sweating, light headed and already hurt myself 3 times already on my chair in the past hour. i don't like this stuff, not one bit"
do you remember that one show... with that one guy... who does that one thing?? yeah me too

"stomach's still hurting, can't wait for this weekend it's going to filled with awesomeness!"
"i had a great night out with friends, went to the haunt and out to eat, finally getting home after 3am, over 7 hours of being outside in the cold and never a dull moment.=)"
"one day i'm going to make all these dreams come true, and it might take years to get where i want to be, i really don't know what i have to face in that time, but i do know that one day i'm to give you the biggest hug i've ever given anyone, and i will tell you thank you for believing in me and sticking through it all."

"i guess since i have this nasty stomach virus i'll lay in bed, write and watch movies. for now it's the twilight saga."
"i have a weird mind, i'm reading this story and one character reminds me of <propfirst> from how i met your mother, and another one reminds me of red herring from a pup named scooby doo. every time i read something about them, those 2 images pop into my mind and i don't know why?! -.-"
"""when the lights go out we'll be safe and sound we'll take control of the world like it's all we have to hold on to and we'll be a dream"""

"let's just jump, not care what happens. we'll take a <propmale>, and hope we make it and if we don't we'll try again but lets just be carefree and we'll deal with what happens after we jump, and we'll hold onto each other for dear life so we won't be alone."
"i really like when people have names that you don't hear everyday! it's interesting, how different things can seem."

"waking up realizing i fell asleep before i did my plans and thinking ""crap i really wanted to do that too"""
going to help ladybug paint her new apartment then going to her parents for the night. =)
"i like when someone says something simple and they don't sound like they have an accent but the more they talk the more it comes out and the more i feel the need to go ""awwww"""
"today feels amazing, i've missed sitting outside with a hoodie on and enjoying nature. tonight i'm sitting by the fire in my hoodie and enjoying it and family."
"went to the zoo today and it was free, going back to the zoo tomorrow for free and to the beach!"
i realized my life is a cliche of a chick flick
trying to find music i used to listen to when i lived in the yellow house and i'm not finding much. =( music has changed so much in the past 10 years.
wherever i go in life i hope i'm humble and true to who and what i am.
"now that my niece is asleep on my stomach, i'm going to relax and read for a bit."
"""i'm a ninja!"" ""no your not"" ""yeah i am"" ""nope"" ""did you just see that?"" ""see what?"" ""exactly!"" =d"
i scream your name it always stays the same i scream and shout so what i'm gonna do now is freak the freak out!
i guess it's time for bed and since i'm at <propfirst>'s and she works tomorrow then i'll work on my stories till she get's home. =d
"i really want it to rain, i think it'd be a good day to sit alone in my room, write and listen to music and be left alone to think things out. i need me time."

"i hate coming home from a friends, and hearing bad news."
"lives change like the weather, so remember to be brave"
"children with special needs only want what we all want - to be accepted. can i make a request of anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour? it is special education week, and this is in honor of all children who learn a little differently."

"just got out of the movies and now headed home, lol fun day."
"watching how i met your mother, and trying to figure personal things out. =)"
"i really don't like scary movies about killer dolls or puppets, i mean it's more creepy then scary."
trying to put my niece to sleep and she's crying and reaching for someone when its just us 2 in the dark room can you say creepy!
"i don't see what's so bad when someone says they don't find the person you like attractive, to me that means ""good, i don't have to view you as a threat"" and if they do find them attractive it's like ""thanks for agreeing with me""  lol"
hanging out with my niece today.
"trying to go back to sleep, i'm tired and sore, and sleep feels so welcoming."
"everything seems perfectly clear right now, there is not an ounce of confusion in my life for the moment, and i love this weird feeling."
i just learnt that cleaning a wound with hot water deactivates stingray venom.
"""i'm like a <propmale> of peace. one who chases the elusive mayfly of love... or something like that.""  =d"
"""when all the broken hearted people living in the world agree, there will be an answer, let it be. for though they may be parted there is still a <propmale> that they will see, there will be an answer. let it be."""
"pocahontas makes me wanna go out of state, and just forget about cell phones and computers and just explore and enjoy nature. i now wanna just lay on the beach, walk through forests, sit around a fire with friends and have fun without technology."
"i really don't like the news, it's depressing and it makes me sick and angry. i also don't like how people get kicked out of serving our country cause they are gay, seriously that's their personal business. it's stupid they are not doing drugs, or being dishonorable, they are simply trying to serve our country, why does it matter if they are gay or not?"
"i really love the song dear god by avenged sevenfold, it's a sweet song."
i helped make dinner and it is yummy!!!
there is nothing like getting a new song stuck in your head and picturing someone singing it and trying not to giggle.
pizza day out with the family! whoot!!
i have bright lights and 3am by matchbox twenty stuck in my head and i don't know why. =/
"i can't wait for friday, going out with friends and having a great night. then probably working out birthday plans, and hanging out saturday and sunday. =)"
"oh no my pet rock died, i'm going to miss him dearly! =("
"i want to watch the rain and listen to stairway to heaven, that would be purely beautiful."
off to bed i'm tired now and i just want sleep. =) peace
"it's weird thinking about how much things change from month to month, it's also weird going through old messages and it becomes clear that everything is different now."
"even when i'm sick i'm a trooper, i still get up make plans and go on like nothing is different. i've changed my mind, i'm going to lay around all day, sleep,relax and have me time, and if someone doesn't like it too bad it's my sick day."
"this time there is no playing dumb and believing your lies, there is no going back, i'm done with it. i'm moving on."
"for once i'm going to bed before 6 am, i'm tired and my head hurts goodnight!"
"i think stupid people should come with a sign, or i should have the right to smack them atleast. just saying"
"""can't he go to a nicer <propfemale> shark?"" ""do you hear yourself they are called <propfemale> sharks, not <propfemale> bunnies, not <propfemale> guppies, they are called <propfemale> sharks, they'll bite your face off"""
i found something that makes me truly happy and keeps my mind off of everything going on around me. it's peaceful and a great escape.
"watching the house of wax, and relaxing."
"i actually like it when i mention my celebrity crushes, and people disagree with me or go all o.o! it really makes me giggle!"
after this morning's event i think i deserve to be able to lay on the couch all day and not be bothered.
i love the cute nicknames i get from my friends!!!
"change of plans, friday night out with friends and having fun, and meeting my aunt <propfemale> for the first time sometime this weekend!! this is going to be a good weekend for me. =)"

"off to sleep, have a great day everyone! =)"
"today is a roll over, go back to sleep and try again tomorrow kinda day. i'm worn out"
i felt special today when a guy held the door for me not once but twice when going into a store. =) manners still live on!
"non pet owners who visit our homes and complain about our pets. 1) they live here, you don't. 2) if you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the furniture. that's why they call it 'fur'-niture. 3) i love my pet more then i like some people!!! 4) to you, they are animals. ...to......me, they are my babies, who are... short, hairy, walk on all fours & don't talk back! ? re-post if you love your pet(s)!!"

"i wanna go to the dent school house this year, anyone wanna go with me? i'm a big chicken and i want a group to go with!"
"trying to think of a costume is kinda hard thing to think of, i wanna be something that is mature but not slutty."
"love is like war easy to begin, hard to end"

"i don't normal find <propmale> houseman attractive, but seeing him dance before all the muscles to jump on it, in that moment he was attractive and i don't know if it was his smile or his dancing but it made me giggle."
"trying to paint but too many people in one room, i couldn't paint so here i am till later.i guess i'll pick up the night shift"

"i like doing funny things when i go to kiss someone's cheek, either making a funny noise or leaning in and whispering ""i'm a vampire"" (it's even funnier when someone gasps and jumps lol i love you mom)"

oh goodness that boy's so hot he should have his own theme music that goes bow-chicka wow-wow every time he appears. =d

"i don't see how singers do it, i can sing about life and love but to sing a song i wrote about heartbreak, i would tear up or cry while singing it. to think about it and feel everything all over again and to remember exactly what happened to cause you to write that, i think it would something hard to do even though in a way your expressing yourself and venting."
if this was a movie you'd be here by now
"i'm not even going to lie, that man has everything right going for him. he's cute,smart,funny,strong and fast, he's tough but yet soft. those tattoos, beautiful brown eyes and a smirk that makes me melt, and i love that fact he's a play baby."

"""you keep loved ones on your right telling others there important to you and friends on your left, there loved but not as much as your loved ones."" just a cute quote i read in a story =)"
"""i'm given all i got to make you stay, or am i just a roadblock in your way? cause your a pretty little windstorm, out on the boulevard something like a sunset, oh yeah a shooting <propfemale> and i might drive myself insane, if those lips <propfemale>t speaking my name"""

"""i think i would like to do something for somebody. i think it's good if someone smiles when you smile at them. the beauty of voluntary acts can <propmale> goodwill in the hearts of others. love which doesn't ask for collateral gives us respect as people. however, it is wrong to try to sustain that. in time the strain will bloom into the flower called lie, the thorny flower which hurts people."""
this is the worst day ever! i just wanna lay in bed and bawl my eyes out!
"so don't you worry your pretty little mindpeople throw rocks at things that shinebut they can't take what's ours"
