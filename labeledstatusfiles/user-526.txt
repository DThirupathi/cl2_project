"5 deadly terms used by a woman: (1) fine: this is the word women use to end an argument when she knows she is right & you need to shut up. (2) nothing: means something & you need to be worried. (3) go ahead: this is a dare, not a permission, do not do it. (4) whatever: a woman's way of saying screw you. (5) that's ok: she is thinking long & hard on how & when you will pay for your mistake. re-post if you agree!"

quiet people are hard to please. they want few topics that are not sensitive. topics they can relate to.
it's pointless. so cut it off.
"""but maybe i'm sticking to the idea that love is a stupid thing_ it doesn't change anything_only makes matters worse. it makes you hurt while you don't deserve to hurt. so much for love. what is the point?"""
excited.
what is so funny? damn it!
nakakatamad ng magbasa. pwede bang ierase muna ang bakasyon sa ulo?

"what's the point in loving? what's the point in friendship if you know it's just going to leave you hanging? if that's the case, it's better then to be alone. at least you wont feel anything. (nakakainis, nakakaiyak, ang sama sama ng loob ko ang sama talaga)."
this sounds familiar... got to deal with it. ;) it takes time. <propfemale>.

"alone in the darkness, i found out the meaning of your tears... i stepped out toward the place i wished for, but i don't want to hurt anyone... regardless of that fate that awaits, i won't regret the things that i live for. because within sadness there is courage and i'll hold on to the light. tears of a blue sky, still falling... someday it will turn into a smile..."
exhausted. 3 more days to go. whew. then to manila.
"i need to make it up to you... i'm sorry, i know i should have treated you better... please don't give up on me..."
"sometimes the best thing we could do is just wait...wait until it will either belong to us, or find it's own."
depressing...
i am at peace. finally...
"i´m on the rocks, i´m on the rocks,and you´re still all that i need to get upbut you bring me down, yeah you bring me down down down"

"i'd give anything now to kill those words for you... each time i say something i regret i cry, ""i don't wanna lose you..."" but somehow i know that you will never leave me..."
"i can't hold on to me. wonder what's wrong with me?lithium, i wanna stay in love with my sorrow."
i love you no matter what. but when you turn me away then what else can i do but to walk away...
life's meaningless without those people who give meaning to it.

"but i don't want you to know because...you'd be happier without me. this is what you wanted to do. because if i truly love you i have to set you free. for our sakes. i have to let go and move on without you."
draw all your negative feelings out!!!
"ui... hahaha. ang saya saya niya. haha. weh. ako ang na eexcite dito eh.super kilig moment naman <propfemale>."
“i don’t know.” have i done those for nothing? were all those things meaningless? “i don’t know.” does it explain why here i am now doing meaningless stuff? “i don’t know.”

ang gago naman nun!
<3 | :* | <3 | :* | <3 | :* | <3 |
love cannot be called as love unless received or reciprocated by someone.
time is too short to waste it on someone who is nonsense!!!
how come the people you value have gone away while those you don't give much attention to stays...
living for someone you love is a lie when the person you love doesn't even give a damn shit about you.
(sigh) i thought so too...
to sleep or to review...
asan?!
happy vacation
"enjoyed the trip very much. icy cold and nice sceneries.thanks a lot. :)"

"all of my regrets will wash away somehow.but how can i forget the way i feel right now..."
“i lost my purpose of holding on to this path.”
conflicts are never solved with words. i know you are not sincere with what you say anyways.
i have sworn to myself that i am content with loneliness.
i wanted you to know how i feel but i thought that i would just keep it to myself. you don't need to know that whenever i hurt you it hurts me too. that after we parted i wanted you back so badly. that i wanted to take all those hurtful words that i've said. that i hope you'd come back and forgive me. that my love for you hasn't faded.

why do you have to be always right? i should have listened to you... thank you. now i learned my lessons the hard way...  :(
is cultivating <propfemale>.
if you say something and really mean in but this person whom you told doesn't believe you... then don't mean it. better do it with someone who appreciates you.
"nhof l. bacquian i still love you and i probably will love you for a very long time. but i can't just be your <propmale>, because as much as i enjoy the concept of being ""just friends"" in reality it's a bizarre form of torture and i'm just not willing to participate in it. so right now what i wanna do is just move on and get over you and the only way for me to do that is to not be around you anymore."
"broken mirror, a million shades of light, the old <propfemale> fades away..."
