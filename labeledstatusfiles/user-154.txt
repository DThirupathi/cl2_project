has seen a lot of <propfemale> trek lately o.o
lost my phone :(  probably won't get a new one for a while (til motorola droid comes out).  e-mail/tweet/im or call my work phone #
"by the way, i am contactable by phone again, same # (though i probably don't have yours).  thanks to my cousin for letting me borrow his old phone!"
going up to <propmale> for homecoming this weekend... too bad the weseminars look boring :(
"really depresed about maine.  heading to sleep, hoping against the odds that i'll wake up to better news :(   ugh, why do voters suck?"
"joan: they removed the privacy settings that allow you to choose who can and can't see your profile pic, which kinda creeps me out.  maybe i'll add a more professional pic later, but meh."
i am not sure if the multiple engagements showing up on my friends' feed are for serious or april fools :p
"put a security deposit down for an apartment for next year!! ahhhh. big two bedroom with a separate kitchen (stainless steel appliances) and separate living room, and a washing machine, though. i like it.  :d"
"thanks for all the birthday wishes, friends!  <3"
"i'm on vacation, but this is important: if you support marriage equality, wherever you are, ny or not, take 1 <propfemale> and call ny senate majority leader <propfirst> skelos at 518-455-3171 and urge him to hold an up-or-down vote on marriage equality today!  we seem to have the votes, but republicans not sure whether to actually bring it up or not!"
"why do i procrastinate so much?  is it possible that it's a disorder, like add?  because if it exists i think i have it.  it's like a phobia of working."
why am i feeling so nostalgic tonight?  gosh.
"umm.  just got on the bolt bus to boston.  hope i'm able to get back to nyc on sunday :/  why now, hurricane?  :("
"yaay, our guest room/office is officially set up with a futon!  friends, now you have no excuse not to come visit nyc =)   let me know if you need a place to crash!  we're off the 125th st. express acbd stop"
"for those nycers who need a place to to deal with this, amnesty international sent me the following message:what: silent march and vigil for <propfirst> <propmale> when: today, september 21st 6:00pm - 8:00pm where: meeting place is the harlem state office building at 6:00pm (125th street & <propfirst> <propmale> powell blvd) and we will have a silent march to st. <propfirst>'s church (521west 126th street - btw broadway & amsterdam)"
"please do me a favor and move your mouse over my name here, wait for the box to load and then move your mouse over the ""subscribe"" link. then uncheck the ""comments and likes."" i would really rather that my comments on friends' posts not be made even more public, thank you very much! then re-post this if you don't want your every single move posted on the right side in the ""ticker box"" for everyone to see. i'm posting this not only for myself, but also so that my friends and family will know how to ask others to do the same if they would not like their every move on facebook noticed. thanks!  (via <propfemale>)"
is going to a lady gaga concert in july?  weird and excellent
"wow, congrats to <propfemale> posner & shining hope for communities for winning the do something award!!  you guys deserved it :)"
"i am feeling pretty uncomfortable with all these new changes to facebook and the ease with which all my favorite books/movies/etc can be data mined.  isn't there a way to let my friends see my interests and no one else?? this is absolutely ridiculous.  f-, facebook."
"this weekend i lay in bed, watched movies, cuddled with <propfirst>, took the time to go downtown for delicious meals, and didn't do any work whatsoever.  i feel amazing."
congrats class of 2010!!  you're all awesome!  now you can move to nyc/boston/san <propfirst> and not have homework anymore.
poor dutch :(
"after 14 hours of travel, a missed connecting flight, and missed important work meetings, i am in laredo, tx!  nothing feels too terrible when you wake up in nyc to ice rain... and end up in a city that's 80 degrees and <propfemale>."
