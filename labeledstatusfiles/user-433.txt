"just saw the best dido and aeneas concert ever... and thinks he is in love with <propfemale> summers :).... and... it was free... free... free!!!! <propmale> arts florissantes are amazing.  <propfemale> summers was amazing as the sorceress.  <propfemale> was amazing.  everything was amazing.  and free! the barbican, hideous concrete monstrosity though it is, is amazing!"
is feeling crushingly homesick and lonely :'( how annoying.
"is filled with mirth after suddenly seeing ""veiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"" appear as a <propmale> subject in his reading..."
"has a presentation to do on assyrian propaganda.  the last presentation he had to do turned into ""herring gulls""..."
advantages of dual monitors: have word and jstor open at the same time without suffering murderous eyestrain disadvantages of dual monitors: have facebook and youtube open at the same time to procrastinate twice as efficiently
"wanted to read professor hornblower's ""mausolus"" tonight, that he might attack his essay tomorrow with confidence and brilliance.  but instead, he's wasted his time on facebook. crap."
"just tried to walk to the library.  instead he appears to have fallen into a metaphorical swimming pool.  damn.  time to stay in, sip tea, and read about mad pastry women it seems..."
one month till christmas!!!!!
"**needs** to finish this essay by tonight, if only to get rid of imaginary mausolus, and the three imaginary artaxerxes glaring at him.  although, artaxerxes iv arses has a funny name.  haha, arses.  yes.  i'm going slowly insane."
"is in tears of confusion and despair after visiting the senate house library.  why did i go there, why, why?!"

"doesn't want imaginary bagoas the insane eunuch grand vizier to poison him.  damn you, imaginary <propmale> iii co-codamol, for running away, otherwise he could have poisoned *you* instead.  will i reach the end of my essay before i am imaginarily poisoned ???"
"finished his essay.  total editing time = 952 minutes.  at least the imaginary artaxerxes, the imaginary hecatomnids, and the imaginary insane bagoas are gone.... for now..... *zombie eyes*"
"faith in the world has been restored.  a car just drove past, music blaring loudly.  the music being... romantic opera!!!! m"
"is disturbed that the first thing he remembered when he woke up was xerxes.  but not *normal* xerxes.  insane, androgynous, <propfemale>, bling-laden xerxes, with a voice 2 octaves below normal humanity!  argh."
is disappointed that he could not find the stone ducks of assyria in the british museum....
"is seized by a bizarre <propfemale> to set up a band called ""the cursive hieroglyphs"""
should have realised that leaving breakfast until 5:00pm was bound to make him feel queasy.  especially when said breakfast was a great big slice of chocolate cake.  bleurgh.

wants to burn everyone and everything related to concepts and categories for their heinous liar-article he has wasted a stupid amount of time reading.  argh argh argh
wants to know what a coachful of army youth armed with machine guns was doing on his street last night... and whether the parading demonstration of jeering youth this morning had anything to do with it...
is pretty much convinced by the book in the library that states sumerian civilisation is the product of the alien lizard people....... it *is* the only explanation for the flying animals after all...
"ooooooooh, ""the archaeomusicology of the ancient near east"" - music + assyria = bwahahahahahahaha......."
is devastated cadbury has been acquired by evil interlopers :(

"was amused by riet <propfirst> bremen's insistence that we ""save the ladybird! save the ladybird!!  the ladybird mustn't be killed!"""
"wonders if the <propmale>s of assyria would appreciate into the woods...... ""for i am the <propmale>, the great <propmale>, the potent <propmale>, the mighty <propmale>, the <propmale> of the world, the <propmale> of assyria, and i went, i went there, i went into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods, into the woods........"""
"overheard people on the street talking about ""satraps"".  he saw a phone advertisement, praising the ""wide range of satr-apps"" available.   or maybe he didn't actually see these things, and his essay is driving him mad."
"ahh the joys of introductory akkadian : tutor - ""beware of getting mutum and m?tum mixed up.  one means husband, the other means death.""  student - ""they're both the same, aren't they ?"""

just back from filming with <propfirst> fry for his new tv series !
just put his laptop in the fridge for 10 minutes after it overheated and crashed during essay writing.  this is not normal behaviour.  eep.
"has just rediscovered the ridiculously audacious hilarity of <propfirst> jenkins' hip-hop dies irae... ""lol"" is probably an appropriate acronym to employ here.."
"facebook suddenly has a whole new meaning post-hellenistic world essay.... hmm... would friend requests from antiochos be all the rage amongst the macedonian elite ? would seleukos change his profile picture to exaggerate his alexander-inspired features??  would there be inane fan pages ""95% of babylonians couldn't see the persian influence in the  architecture of the palace at ai-khanoum lol!1""???  the mind boggles."
"has fury, in the last moments of the finale of the finale, when relief leads to negligence that begets rashness...that is when the comeback that faltered comes back and beats your pathetic comeback that i scoff at!"
history revision (and history in general) just isn't the same without copious amounts of haribo ...
"really thinks there should be more hollywood blockbuster movies with mesopotamia in them.  ""babylonians in space"" or ""a connecticut yankee in <propmale> ashurbanipal's court"", anyone ?"
