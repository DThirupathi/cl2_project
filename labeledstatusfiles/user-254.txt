"hey everybody!!!!!! yeah i don't have anything to say, just wanted to say hey!"
wow. its really late. bet no one else is up right now and feeling nice like me.

being a grown up sucks!!!
"too much stuff to do, so little time..."
absolutely nothing is on my mind.
huntsville really could use some sidewalks.

"there is so much on my mind, i don't even know where to <propfemale>t. i saw a shooting <propfemale> the other night. what does it mean?"
"oh yeah, its not new years yet..."
happppy new year!!!

"oh well, guess i won't be making it to philly:("
tomorrow is wednesday. i really don't like wednesdays.
its time to let my creativity flourish. can't hold it in no more. it's coming out... now!!
i guess no one has any children's choir songs in the back of their head...

"things are finally working in my favor, sigh..."
tomorrow is wednesday. i hate wednesdays.
relaxing weekend begins now!
"its funny how when it comes down to it, people will show their true colors. and as much as i love color, those ones are hideous."
i've come to the realisation that when it comes down to it nobody- and i mean nobody really has your back. i guess that's why we're supposed to <propfemale> on jesus... even though we can't see him or can't always hear him... that is so hard to do cause i'm  a realist. but he has stripped me of all distractions i guess...
i'm gonna have a great day today. i claim it!!
"if romeisha shade does not stop wearing that hideous red suit with the not long enough sleeves and the huge shoulder pads and the red buttons down the side with the flairing out at the bottom of the jacket,.... i will boycott waff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
i hate alabama!!!! someone get me out of this state full of poor republican idiots!!!
i'm free i'm free!!!!! no more work til monday!!! yayyyyy!!
"thanking god for another year of life for my son, dj. he's not so little anymore- the big 6!"
watching the drama of the nj housewives. back to back.luv it!
"well folks, back to the grind, getting ready for church! hmmm what shall i play today...?"
zzzzzzzzzzzzz......
is hoping i can make some money very soon!!! anybody need piano lessons??
there goes those ugly colors again.
"wow. nate was a good friend and a beautiful person. i will be remembering the good times, and the good music. my thoughts and prayers are with his family. its like you never get to say goodbye..."
noooo!!! i'm not ready to go to work tomorrow!!! wait!!!
blah blah blah blah
don't put all your eggs in one basket.
wow what a weekend!!!!
"i mean, how long can u hold a grudge???"
i'm really hating my life right now
"i'm completely content right now. good music, good wine, and good colors. working it out on the paper. i'm alive!!!!"
i had a nice restful weekend with my babies...
wednesday is over. sigh...
g'night fb.

"dj: good morning mommy! me: good morning dj! dj: (sneezes and picks something off of the carpet) look mommy, my tooth!"
loving life
uggghhh!!! don't wanna go back to work tomorrow:(
"i'll be leaving huntsville in two days, yippee!!!"
middle school kids freely allow themselves to be used by the devil!!!!!!!!! they are horrible.
"so, i am about to embark on a change of career path. enrolling back into school to pursue my true passion. a little scary but a lot exciting!!! wish me luck!"
i had a gloomy day today... cloudy and humid all day:( church was super emotional...
one more day til i get a break!
"successful monday, getting my students ready for graduation. can't wait til may 25!!"
yup. just checking in before i head to work. facebook is like crack.
"ummmmm, nothing at all...."
i'm waiting to exhale... come on thursday!!

"ahhhhh, friday..."
i feel like poop right now and i don't know why. any suggestions?
likes it on the couch or on the piano!!!
last week of school!!!! yay!!!!
i just painted my toes and they look pretty.
just went to see the color purple tonight. it was so inspiring. i loved it!! wish i could just live on broadway!!!
so i had a great weekend. hurry and go fast week so i can get to next weekend!!
why am i still up????
my break has officially begun... now!
"so i will be working for a summer camp that won't pay me enough to allow my own kids to go to. they won't even offer me a discount!!! and this camp is through a church-a very well off one, i might add. so, i have to drive my kids across town to another camp that at least offers a scholarship, and is not affiliated with any church. what's wrong with this picture???????"
is so bored...
what is the time frame for when you keep trying to do something but you're not doing it well. when is it ok to just give it up?
"well everyone, my day officially sucks! so sick of dissappointment. huntsville city schools are to blame for this one. i hate alabama!!"
so. what now??
i'm cleaning the scavengers out of my life once and for all. good riddance!! lol.
my brookie bear has a fever:( and my eyes are burning from waking up at two in the morning. i love being a mommy!
still bored. and broke i might add. if i wasn't so broke i'm sure i wouldn't be so bored. donations anyone??
ok i get the point. don't give up just yet...
too many happy people on fb. is this truly realistic??

great. i get up and the power is out. perfect.
