every story worth telling begins with <propfemale> and i. your my best friend.
"and yet i wonder, if your slipping from my fingers."

this is were nightmares become realities...
i'm your terror. i'm your nightmare.

i've made up my mind. its your turn to step up now.
i think i'm in trouble...
this is the worst feeling of my life..
"realizes i'm not a bad person. :d i can do this. kick my depression with my brother, mom and best friend <propfemale> by my side. 'they' just need time to think."
i can do bad all by myself xp
"i like this movie :) i don't need no one to put me down, to make me frown just makes me look older. i'll worry about me. you worry about you."
you cannot help anybody when your lost. you need somebody to care about you to tell you your worth it :)
i'll just stay positive :)
nervous about surgery. wish me luck :)
"i am cupid, god of love. i come from the stars above :)"

some things you never forget
some people were born more fortunate than others. but even a palace can be a prison.
"teach me, so i not wish to think"
spagetti :3
your lips give my thy urge. give me my sin again.
"feels sad,sick, and wrong. but cheerful thoughts, i try to have"
