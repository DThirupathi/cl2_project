"we are a lost generation, desperately clinging to anything that feels real, but too afraid to become it ourselves. we are a defeated generation, resigned to the hypocrisy of those before us. we are the last generation, a culmination of all previous things, destroyed by the vapidity that surrounds us. a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new.  ~douglas haddow, poet"
i'm off to register for classes. wish me luck!
