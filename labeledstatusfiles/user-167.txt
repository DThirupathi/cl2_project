i just remember this one time i went to get a burrito and the guy making the burrito was eating from it. at the time it didn't bother me but now i'm disgusted.
"today, i was thinking of not being a vegetarian anymore on another note i went off on a freshmen weird but i have the smallest <propfemale> today :( i feel bad but oh well."

i just watched the boy in the striped pajamas for the first time. wow it's been awhile since i have seen a good movie.

i love rice and i just ran out :( i like to eat my rice with sugar is that weird? i want to get my nose pierced but maybe one hole in my face is more than enough. i love the song man on the <propfemale> by kid cudi and that is what's on my mind right now
singing <propmale> <propmale> like a mad man
fighting evil by <propfemale> light winning love by day light never running from a real fight she is the one named sailor <propfemale> :)
facebook is so confusing and apparently i don't know how to spell my own last name but thanks to <propfirst> pham that was changed. i'm going to go off now and watch the ultimate fighter like a loser haha.
i'm beyond angry.
my arm still hurts from yesterday from jiu jitsu but today it feels even worse that's what i get for having too much pride.
i feel a lot better now since i talked to my friends and family :)

"the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. it eluded us then, but that's no matter-tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....and one fine morning-so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past-the great gatsby"
