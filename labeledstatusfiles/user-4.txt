when is it okay to quit? they state again and again how they wish for death and you do all you can to restore their <propfemale> to live. yet they always return to that fatalistic intrigue. you know they will never act on it. that it is a facade. but still the statement worries you so you continue to fight. after how long do you give up? i need to know. i cant take much more before exhaustion sets in.
goin <propfemale> watch green hornet in 3d o yeah

happy saint patricks day! wearin black and red and aint drinkin whiskey or guiness. i will be hunting for leprechauns though ;)
"the world is a scary place. a lot of scary things can happen. you should know, though, that you will always have someone there for you. this makes things much less scary. but when there are two people scared, should they not have each other?"
"it becomes only that much more terrifying when one chooses the aid of another and leaves the other in the dark. do not let yourself become this person. if you and someone else are facing a situation, be each others strength. do not make the other face fear alone."
