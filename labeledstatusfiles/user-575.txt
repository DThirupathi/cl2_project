null.
is hyped for the lannnnnn.
"money, money, money. todays world it seems almost impossible."
oi!

"people wear a mask it seems. no matter how much you offer, you're nothing."
it seemed so real.
"you never cared, so why did you pretend?"
fuck you.
lost.
"going to mw2 it up, then get my suit ready for work."
"yet still torn and hurts like fucking hell, though the sudden change of heart from the ex - ""fiance"" should be good reason to laugh and move on. unfortunately true love doesn't work like that."
"someday someone real will come. until then, work, clubs, and getting the hell out of the house time."
is attempting to find local web/graphics design work... still.
"i wish i knew what i had done so wrong. from loved and cherished to nothing, not even a friend, so fast and randomly. that is what i am now, and i know it's what i will always be, and there's nothing stopping it."
"broken, and deceived."
some people live secret lives.
is going to loose it.
finds the game of life rather irritating.
null.
"destroyed and hopeless. love forever, i was told. as well as many others. every single promise had been broken. i believed in her. but apperently i'm nothing anymore, just a fly, within 10 minutes. no explanation, nothing. hope she is enjoying her weekend, and has have at home. farewell.."

"i manage to even forget taking ""add medication"" doses. only by 10 hours. worthless chemicals. worthless pharmaceutical corporate laboratories. tools."
note to self. current mental state is horrible for commanding soviet armys in large scale warfare as germans just pwned me and enjoyed a 3:1 kill death ratio. add and high command don't mix? <propfemale>?
"hmm. what branch of military and unit type would actually benefit from being add. must think. obviously not high command of any kind. definitely not u-boats. i know. aa gunner! win."
i can't believe how clueless i was to the size of my fathers side of my family until recently. o.o. a family tree went from simple to chaos rather quickly. lol.
"simplicity, hidden deep amongst chaos."
stuck homeeeeeeeeeeeeeee on a fridaaaaaaaaayyyyyy. noooooooooooooooooooo.
i was... who i will never be. i surrender to this void.. forever.
"i swear if i knew how to cut my own hair that didn't involve a hawk i'd do it. by far the most irritating thing to have in my face every bloody second. every cigarette tends to involve me lighting myself on fire.its a saturday and i have woke up to an empty house and no car. and i killed what was left of the booze last night. story of my life."
"sleep seems like the only home i have. feel as if i just ""exsist"" floating around void."
sick.. sigh. fever/throat/chills/allthe-youhaveaflumoron symptoms. yay.
thanks everyone for the birthday wishes.
"schlafen, mein freund."
"really need to figure out this social thing. it seems i keep scaring people off. i honestly do try to get out of the house, but seem to also fail at that. highschool was easy mode. this is chaos."
i have no idea how i've managed to loose the same pack of cigarettes 5x in a row. this time they are being uber sneaky.
i dont know. text if you want to do something.

i would love to trash this computer. or anything breakable that can be broken constantly. yep.
limbo.
"you know not of i anymore but, i remember you. every second. being kind and loyal must be traits to shrug away in our time, then. so be it."

mom vs me on nemisis.
"games. i always thought these were on the computer, not in almost everyone i meets intentions/mind. as stupid as i may act, i know when people do so, the question is, why would they take the time to do so? decay slowly sets in after allowing it, hoping people come to their senses, but alas, i think i've hit the brink. nice people whome still have emotions apparently get no where. sadly there's not a way to stop."
headache # 123123213. x2. + bored on saturday night. = fail.

"a year ago to this date, i was the happiest person alive. now i wonder why i even breath."
"think for a second. how many times have you thought, or heard ""our world has a bright future ahead of it."" i bet, you only just now have.. individuals interested in only themselves will never change and so long as we all are scattered tards, lacking true unity, we will see nothing else but a cycle that has repeated for century's. at one point, we will destroy ourselves."
lame season to be alone.
clueless at the moment. wandering outside and drawing may be the plan.
done with work. bored and feel like smashing a hd with a bat. this is a possible cure for my boredom temporarily.
and here i am.
