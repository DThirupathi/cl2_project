"i'm convinced that dogs have a place in heaven. there are probably no fleas there. and they probably have their own fire hydrants and pee-posts. and maybe they even have their own tiled bathrooms.  and chew toys. and sticks and frisbees and <propfemale> bones. oh, and don't forget their wings. dogs fly up there. yup, dogs definitely go to heaven. so i have no reason to worry. up there, dogs are safe. they're happy."

"sleep + dreams= very creepy.one second, i'm fully awake and just staring at the wall. the next, my eyelids are drooping and my brain is attacked by scenarios of pink elephants slurping chocolate syrup from my head."
listening to a toilet flush from more than a mile away from where you are is weird. very weird. :))
the sky here isn't dark enough for stars to come out... i miss stars! :((
first real day of being a 15-year-old: still the same as ever. :)
"if you make me choose between a dreamless sleep and a sleep filled with good dreams, i'd take the dreamless sleep anytime without hesitation. why?i'm scared.my nice dreams always turn out to be nightmares in the end. :("
"""each person who ever was or is or will be has a song. it isn't a song that anybody else wrote. it has its own <propfemale>, it has its own words. very few people get to sing their song. most of us fear that we cannot do it justice with our voices, or that our words are too foolish or too honest, or too odd. so people live their song instead."" — <propmale> gaiman (anansi boys)"
"""when life lands a hammer blow in your face, do your best to respond to the hammer as if it had been a cream pie."""

"""you know you've read a good book when you turn the last <propfemale> and feel a little as if you lost a friend."""
stupid infatuation. why'd you have to get to me too??
"""we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.""-<propfirst> wilde"

"""just because we don't understand doesn't mean the explanation doesn't exist."""
"""be careful about reading health books. you may die of a misprint."" — <propfirst> twain:d"
"""it's gonna get worse before it gets better.""oh, but it's gonna get better. yes it is. :d"
i am flabbergasted. utterly and severely flabbergasted. :p
i'm actually feeling hyper... about doing homework. whoa. wow. :))
"if being absurdly, ridiculously, recklessly happy were a crime, then i'd probably be sitting on an electric chair right now instead of comfortable, sturdy wood. :))"
"""one last hope to rise and break away beyond the faded line, way beyond the ties that bind."" ~alter bridge, ""ties that bind"""

"happy, giddy, ecstatic, confused, shocked, surprised, euphoric, bubbling, anticipating, nervous, excited, anxious, happy, and confused-- all in one night. what in the world happened to just plain ""happy""? p.s. happy is the dominant emotion. next is confused. :pg'night, everyone. :d"
"imagine this: you and your friends are all walking out of the movie theater. you just finished a great movie and you feel really good. you're taking the lead, strutting confidently down the aisle, thinking ""gosh, i feel so cool!"". then you pause. you feel something wrong. where're your friends? you turn around to see them all pointing and laughing at you. then you look where you were headed: the fire exit. :))"

i've been thinking about it for these past weeks: i don't belong here. at all. and what an unbelievably gigantic relief that is. :d
i've given up on giving up slowly. :d
"""i pledge allegiance to a country without borders, without politicians..."" and yeah, i'm going there. sooner or later. :] <3"
