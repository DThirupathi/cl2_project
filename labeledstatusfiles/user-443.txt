"omg, what a day. i have yet another 10 hour workday to look forward to tomorrow. my boss told me today just how much she appreciates my working all these long hours now that we're short staffed. and, she put in for me to get a raise. the raise is almost a dollar more than what i'm making now. i hope it goes through. i'm excited. now if only i could sleep all night long......"
"ugh, too tired to fight sleep anymore. trying to win an auction. i'll probably lose it now. off to <propfemale> land once more today."
i would like to be drunk right now......maybe then i'd be tired and in a better mood.

its never really a full day at work until i have a near heart attack.
"only approx. 48 more hours until i leave for <propmale>. i don't want to go, but i know that i have to in order to better our situation. i'll be honest, i'm nervous as all hell!"
"just got paid and already i want to cry. rent is due and now i have 30 bucks for food until next friday. department of human services better not deny me. i swear if they do, i will cry."

"another day gone by. spent my mother's day at work, then went home. <propfirst> made me a mother's day spongebob squarepants picture. i loved it, of course. then proceeded to get loved on as i passed out on the couch. full body scratching is the best!"
"this is so not fair......i'm supposed to be going to alabama next week and i'm sick as a dog right now! this is not going to stop me from going to the academy! this better not be pneumonia! if it is, i'm blaming pepper!!!!"
nothing is quite like working with animals during a full <propfemale>.....................
"dear asshole, go away. i am not in the mood to deal with you anymore....... i wish i was born into a sane, logical thinking family. some of them are, but only some of them."
happy early mother's day to all that it applies too. i get to work on my mother's day. my only wish is that i get paid holiday pay. how dare a man tell me that its not a qualified holiday?
"i was just bullshittin'! and you know this, man!!!!!!!!"

"hey, peoples in ms, could you possibly lend <propfirst> a hand on getting another job? his boss is an absolute <propmale>, he isn't going anywhere, and all the other places that he's sent resume's in and aps haven't called him back. we need help and fast food isn't going to cut it. he needs to make more than minimum wage."
"a true friend doesn't care when you're broke, what you weigh, if your house is a mess, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazy people. they love you for who you are. a true friend can go long periods of time without speaking to you and never question the friendship. repost if u have at least one true friend. they will know who they are..........."

"exhausted! got off work at 9pm and have to be back at 7am. when you don't normally sleep without some kind of chemical aid, it sucks!"
"moment of nostalgia- for those fortunate enough to remember principle robbins at vandenberg back in the day.......""my hat, it has three corners. three corners has my hat. if it didn't have three corners. it would not be my hat!"""
