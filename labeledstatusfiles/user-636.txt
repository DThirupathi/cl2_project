should i stop being a vegetarian? what do you think?
"the thought that some people are able to describe people as ""undesirable,"" like the conservative party does in v for vendetta, is disgusting. everyone deserves love and respect from their peers. but then again i suppose the idea of people being undesirable, is the same concept as god sending his/her children to hell. they are both disgusting, and poor ways of thinking. ...sorry. just ranting again."
"every inch of me shall perish. every inch, but one. [integrity.] an inch. it is small and it is fragile and it is the only thing in the world worth having. we must never lose it or give it away. we must never let [the government] take it from us. ...i hope that the worlds turns, and that things get better. -<propfemale>"
the right strikes again. i just heard that the tea is trying to remove anything that they find liberal in history textbooks; starting with the political and philosophical views of our forefathers. there are supposed to be over 100 changes made. ...so much for recieving an education. thanks texas. -_-

"if someone wants to come kidnap my niece while i'm taking care of her, i won't stop them."
"i saw today a sign on the back of a <propfirst> that said, ""believe in jesus! turn or burn!"" which got me thinking, is faith simply a way for us to avoid the possibility of hell, or is it something more; something life changing; something that gives us strength to face the day; something that encourage us to live, love, and forgive; something to better our lives and the lives of others; something real?"

"i know this woman! she lives here in abilene! she is the current owner of the natural food center! who would of thought that the executive director of one of the most well known gay christian activist groups lives right here in abilene.http://www.soulforce.org/blog/announcing-our-new-executive-director/"
"""all will be redeemed in god's fullness of time, all, not just the small portion of the population who have been given the grace to know and accept christ. all the strayed and stolen sheep. all the little lost ones."" -<propfemale> l'engle"
i'm in the process of learning the elvish dialect of quenya. be jealous.
"""hell always has and always will be empty. why? because i actually love you!"" -god"

everyone in the mcmurry area needs to go reconciling ministries network training tomorrow from 9:30 am - 3 pm to learn how to make a more loving and inclusive church. the kind of church christ dreamed of.
"hogwarts! hogwarts! hogi, hogi, hogwarts! teach us something please!"
haha i'm pretty sure i'm the worst dancer in gsa.
"dear westboro baptist,i'm a gay, pangender person. when jesus said, ""for god so loved the world...,"" i believe that included me.love,a ""fag"" that loves god very much."
nothing makes me happier than watching <propfemale> silverman do her thing.
"i hate when you're not feeling that well, and you just think, i'll sleep a little longer. then when you wake up you realize all your classes are over, and so is lunch. ...that just happened."
i hate it when the person you like the most just thinks of you as a friend.
i slept a total of 20 hours. i don't know what to think about that.
i just had a strange realization. liberal christianity is my culture.
my marxist feminist dialectic brings all the boys to the yard.
what continues to alarm me is the fact that christians believe that god loves them and no one else. that is something truly concerning.
does anybody know what's up with the bonfire?
"when you have a problem with your tent, call a lesbian. they can help."
i just aced a philosophy test. this shall be a night of partying.
"everyone in the abilene area! dr. miller, one of the most brilliant professors at mcmurry will be making a case for homosexuality, and will be using the bible, christian ethics, and all things jesus-y to do it! be there! it will be amazing. just like all of his lessons."
the bible is not god. quit trying to make it that.
she is jealous for us all. and she will never give up on us. never. on no day will heaven's gates close. revelation 21:25
"i don't want to go to class today! i don't care about ""liberal"" protestantism, and i sure as hell don't care about neo-orthodoxy. why does intro. to christianity have to be so lame?? can't we just talk about jesus for once. that would be lovely."
"my favorite person who was hateful to us at cite' lespwa.hateful person: you need to send them guns and ammunition so they can protect themselves next time instead of giving them hand outs.me: it was f***ing earthquake, you idiot!"
"today is day of silence. a day that raises the awareness that in 2011 there are still lgbt people abused by hate rhetoric from the church, family, and others. with all due respect to the people who created this day, i can't stay silent. 30% of all teen suicides each year are the result of this. lgbts need to know that there is nothing wrong with them. for when god has called something good, who are we to call it sin?"
hospitals are so boring.
"to the person down the hall that keeps yelling, ""are you a f***king queer?"" yes already... i am a f***king queer."
"i'm really considering going vegan, so if everyone could just go ahead and get their hateful comments out of the way on this status, that would be lovely."
happy earth day! :d

"i'm bored and like to procrastinate. so like this and i'll tell you:1.) how we met.2.) my first impression of you.3.) what i like about you.4.) favorite memory of you"
"oh <propmale> potter, how i love to watch you again and again."
i had a dream that the our lady of <propfirst> gave me a carne guisada. i think i miss eating meat.
there is no <propfemale> of such virtue than the one that bare jesu.
"""he has shown you, o mortal, what is good. and what does the lord require of you? to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god."" -<propfirst> 6:8"
i will not celebrate a person's death. this is a life. a human. i could never be happy that a human had to die. that would be immoral. no matter who the person was.
blessed pope <propfirst> <propfirst> ii. i like the way that sounds. :)
"""as surely as i live, declares the sovereign lord, i take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live."" -<propmale> 33:11"
"""do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice."" -proverbs 24:17"
"i once saw a video where the blessed pope <propfirst> <propfirst> ii went to a leper colony, and he actually touched these people who society wants nothing to do with. i want to love like that."
"i hate how awkward i am in situations in which i hardly know anyone there. and also, thank you to who ever bought me supper tonight. i wish i could have known who you were so i could have thanked you in person."
may the 4th be with you...
"peace is a lie, there is only passion.through passion, i gain strength.through strength, i gain power.through power, i gain victory.through victory, my chains are broken.the force shall me free. -the sith code, darth bane <3"
who in this area owns <propfemale> wars. i must see this today.
"darth bane. you are the evilest of evil. your presence makes me cringe. the fact that your face is sometimes green makes me feel a little queasy. will you marry me? if you marry me, a man, in the eyes of this galaxy, you would be most definitely the most evil."
this is the rule of two: one master and one apprentice. -darth bane (only true <propfemale> wars fans will know this.)
"got my sith eyes on, 'cause it's <propfemale> wars day."
"i'm a winner, and you're fat."
revenge of the fifth!
"i hate how some closet gays use girls. i mean really and truly use girls. just grow up. be a man. and come out. stop playing with innocent girl's hearts to ""better"" your reputation. it's really screwed up. i don't care how afraid you are to come out, it's screwed up."
"ok, adorable nerdy guy. you can show up in my life anytime now, and cuddle with me while i watch <propmale> potter. that would be stellar."
i'm going to be turning 19 in three days. i don't know how i feel about this. :/
"favorite part of today's sermon: ""you might be an episcopalian if while watching <propfemale> wars you here 'the force be with you,' and you feel compelled to say, 'and also with you.'"" the sad thing is, i totally say that."
open your eyes! i see your eyes are open!
