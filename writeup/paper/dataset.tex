\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
As a part of training data we were given 127216 Facebook statuses belonging to 700 users. For each status we were also given the time at which the status was posted. For each user we had the following metadata:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gender
\item CES-D score
\item Individual scores for the 20 questions
\end{enumerate}
Apart from this, we were also given  X Facebook statuses belonging to 12540 users without their labels (we call this the unlabeled training data)\\\\
As a part of testing data, we were given the same metadata for 239 users and asked to predict their labels.
