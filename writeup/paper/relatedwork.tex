In this section, we review some of the existing work on using computational linguistics methods for analyzing emotional disorders. Resnik et. al. \cite{ResnikGR13} used LIWC and LDA features to predict neuroticism in college students.  They demonstrate the utility of adding \textit{topic} features to predict neuroticism in college students. Golnoosh et. al. look at Facebook data and predict personality of users based on their activity in Facebook. Since, our dataset is very similar to theirs, we also borrow some of their features and incorporate them in our models. We enhance the models using \textit{topic modeling} and some variants of \textit{topic modeling} such as \textit{SeededLDA} to predict depression in Facebook users.
