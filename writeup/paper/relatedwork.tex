\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

In this section, we review some of the existing work on using computational linguistics methods for analyzing emotional disorders. Resnik et. al. \cite{ResnikGR13} used LIWC and LDA features to predict neuroticism in college students.  They demonstrate the utility of adding \textit{topic} features to predict neuroticism in college students. We borrow ideas from their work and explore \textit{topic modeling} and some variants of \textit{topic modeling} such as \textit{SeededLDA} to predict depression in Facebook users.
