2010-12-10 18:06:14 well it seems quite likely by now that any birthday cards that were meant to reach me were lost in the post    i question the competence of the postal service here 
2010-11-05 21:54:34 hurt  very much so  to see a close friend so upset    bad time to run out of tissues 
2010-12-01 12:10:50 "it's no wonder we're behind schedule in the physics core module    dr froebrich just rambles on about stuff that although is an important principle, it is logical enough to deduce without being told (at least for me)    and often leaves out stuff that i can't logically deduce    guess it's just my awkwardness of understanding the complex and missing the obvious   "
2010-09-07 18:57:45 now can't find his important emails because facebook has been flooding his inbox t t
2010-12-01 07:06:52 really can't be bothered with lectures today    but one must endure 
2011-01-16 03:02:20 so nice to have the corridor to myself   best enjoy it whilst i can before the kitchen fills with dirty dishes and the toilet gets disgusting :<
2011-01-27 01:57:15 "whose idea was it to put croutons in soup? soup's not supposed to be crunchy, damn it!"
2010-10-28 02:40:55 "platonic love    too broad a term  the english language needs a word that e playful resses platonic love at an intimacy that is on par with a romantic relationship, and includes the same level of caring, sharing and closeness, but without any sexual involvement at all  a relationship where a hug could last forever without letting go, with the warmth that makes everything else pointless "
2011-01-28 00:02:57 who could ask for anything better? sushi followed by a huge tub of greek-style <propfemale> yoghurt 
2010-09-28 19:42:56 "i dunno why tuna with sunflower oil is cheaper than with brine, but it certainly tastes a hech of a lot better    and has a fun sliminess to it too ^^"
2010-10-02 01:59:59 "everything's fine  i'm still living off tuna in a sense, but i combine it with other food in most of my meals    like <propmale> cheese or baked beans"

2010-10-13 18:45:09 ultimate boredom = liking spree
2010-10-10 01:08:19 humanity's care toward outward appearance is misplaced  it matters not what we are on the outside  it is the heart that truly shapes the being  those of us who are able to look at the heart and see that beforehand are those with true perception  those who search for heart before they judge another's actions are those who truly care  those who live by their heart rather than their vanity are those who truly deserve 
2011-02-05 00:50:00 "ok, make that 150gb now    xfire recorded videos take up huge areas of space - -"

2010-11-22 09:21:44 wondering whether today's lab session is going to be intriguing or a total bore like the last one (which was about multimeters and oscilloscopes)

2011-01-20 18:12:31 never again will i take guis for granted    specially when a rather uncooperative unix console won't accept using bash 
2011-02-18 23:21:26 "i remember the days when Â£2 could get me a whole carrier bag of sweets    now, all i can get is a couple of chocolate bars and a packet of crisps - -"
2011-02-19 15:29:18 "wow, the kettle here is so full of limescale    looks quite old, too    still, i trust it more than the kettle in my previous residence, which was always covered in food, or stolen by someone"
2011-02-20 19:12:29 "come to think of it, why are there peppa pig stickers on the fridge   ?"

2011-02-24 18:36:34 "full from eating too much sushi    and i can't get enough of wasabi sauce  annoyed  (i'm also glad that the sushi sold at the local shop has real wasabi, even if it is mixed with horseraddish    apparently, a lot of places just sell a mixture of mustard, horseraddish and food colouring, as wasabi is so hard to cultivate)"
2011-02-27 11:34:52 "first i have a night where i can't stay awake, then i have one where i can't sleep    strange weekend "

2011-03-06 04:01:57 "*drooling over yamaha tyros4* that keyboard looks awesome    but it's over Â£3000 in price t t i bet it sounds brilliant though    and even has ""super realistic guitar"" sounds    and it's recording capabilities look brilliant, and it supports a microphone    wish i could afford that t t"
2011-02-05 09:37:57 ugh    damned neighbour keeping me up all night watching bleach at unnecissarily high volume

2010-11-24 12:12:27 "there's a protest going on outside the library, and i can hear it from here    not that i'm complaining, but i won't join in, either "
2010-12-03 21:24:03 there's something strange going on around uni tonight    seems everyone is compelled to purchase obscene amounts of pick n mix    could be some sort of instinctive reaction to the shop being low on stock due to the snow

2011-02-04 04:36:33 "blar, can't i even have 1 day of the kitchen being clean, or empty of piles of dishes and cutlery? wish people would wipe up after themselves or wash up right away, or at least keep their dirty dishes where it's more convenient "
2011-01-16 12:14:42 "here we go again    it's quite clear my neighbour is back, given the noise i woke up to  how loud does he need that music? i swear, it's louder than my laptop speekers can even go  and the <propmale> volume on this is more than enough "
2011-02-10 10:23:01 "gah, why must firefox 4 use icons that 1) are too hard to see with my persona skin and 2) are not so colourful? like the back button    it's only slightly lighter when it can be pressed than when it can't    gets confusing"

2011-02-08 20:28:55 "blar, ok, the tv series outcasts seems quite depressing    but then what bbc sci-fi series isn't? why don't we do a spaceship-based series for once? last serious one was    what? <propfirst>'s 7? and since then, we've only done 2 sit-coms, plus i'm sure cbbc did something a while ago, but i don't care about that    there wasn't much on cbbc i liked even when i was young enough to watch it "
