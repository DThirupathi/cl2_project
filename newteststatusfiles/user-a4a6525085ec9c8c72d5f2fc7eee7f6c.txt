2010-11-14 08:36:57 "i am tired of this 'all or none' mentality people have toward <propmale>  <propmale> issuch a subjective thing, one can not simply say that everything of something is <propmale> or isn't <propmale>  *sigh* why is this a difficult concept? it's as if one took one of those awful twilight books and judged the whole of writing on it and thus decided that all novels were garbage  you just  you just can't do that"

2010-05-04 19:22:46 "the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure  that she carries, or the way she combs her hair  the beauty of a woman  is seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place  where love resides  true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul   it's the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she shows  & the beauty of a woman only grows with passing years-audrey hepburn"

2010-05-18 21:08:03 just read an article that states 'dads get postpartum depression too' and is surprised that this seems to be a novel idea to some  it makes perfect sense to me that new dads would go through a lot of the same feelings that new moms do 
2010-12-09 03:33:26 the host lady of the new show 'bitchin' kitchen' on cooking channel has such an interesting accent and style

2010-06-12 05:50:00 "it angers me to read someone claim that 'all homosexuals have a match of the opposite sex suited to them more then anyone of the same sex' saying that same sex tendencies should be 'conquered' and 'never accepted' yet claiming that they have no problem with homosexuality  saying marriage is only real if its done under their god, that love has no place in wanting to spend your life with someone else "
2010-06-04 02:41:51 cleaning up linework is both tedious and rewarding

2010-06-02 05:03:32 i love eating twix but their commercials featuring men cheating and conning girls to sleep with them are just idiotic   what a dumb ad campaign for a <propfemale> bar
2010-12-18 10:16:06 "so i just watched a commercial of some animator lady showing kids how to draw spongebob and the whole time all i could think was that she was holding her pencil soooo weird   she had it clenched in her fist so oddly, it looked really awkward and uncomfortable"

2010-07-09 06:18:03 "*sigh* oh blogger site, why won't you let me finish uploading my sketches and <propmale>? how very rude of you "
2011-01-19 14:26:59 "my blog now has 11 followers which might not sound like a lot to, well, anyone but the fact that 7 of those are people i don't know at all that means something to me ^^"
2010-08-01 01:04:35 did you see that ludicrous display last night?
2010-12-03 06:55:58 "damn general blue! you scream like a little girl when i hit you but you're so freaking hard to kill! you're my favorite red ribbon army general even if you're not into girls, haha"

2010-07-29 20:21:57 found out that her current freelance client will be stationed in afghanistan soon and will be there for four months! sadness for both him (hoping he'll be safe!) and my wallet
2010-06-18 23:15:30 just watched two idiots in the appartment building nextdoor jump first from the fourth floor and then from the fith floor into the pool before bolting away in what seemed to be some sort of fear   what the hell is wrong with people?  they're lucky they didn't crack open their heads 
2011-01-13 14:41:51 "have i mentioned how much i hate migraines? because i do, i hate them a lot  they leave me so drained the next day   still feeling the effects of last nights   at least they seem to get less and less common as the years go by, can't remember the last one i had"
2011-01-11 12:50:53 for once i'm awake at this time because i actually woke up rather then stayed up   i like that i woke up in time to watch the hub's morning cartoon lineup^^

2010-09-02 06:21:09 "i have a deep dislike for the overzealous of the world espousing that only they and theirs have morality  one's religion does not make one better then anyone else, nothing is ever that stark, rather everything is in shades of gray with constant overlapping "
2010-11-15 22:36:06 "i've been fighting the urge these past few days to go back and edit my novel but i must prevail  i'm not finished yet, i've got to press on and have the thing 100% drafted out before changing anything  *tries to be determined*"

2010-11-29 19:13:54 i just had someone tell me that they 'don't think critique belongs in the <propmale> world' and they think that they have a <propmale> of making it as a freelancer     they obviously assume that there aren't clients will accept anything and everything you make even if you aren't good *says the girl that works her ass off to make things worthwhile for clients*
2010-08-15 21:56:04 we just found lebanon bologna for sale at the deli in our winn dixie   i've honestly never seen this outside <propfemale> so that's kinda sorta awesome for my lunchings! if only it was sweet bologna

2011-02-07 19:58:42 yay my copy of rasl came in at the bookstore today! i got the pocketbook so it has issues 1-7 in it! sadly he's only up to issue 9 so it will probably be a long time before the second one comes out (is not complaining because <propmale> smith is awesome)
2011-02-06 05:06:32 "double date was fun, if rather e playful ensive  the food was amazing though and it was a blast actually going out with friends again "

2010-10-26 04:59:26 this evening was a bust   our new tablecloth was ruined by melting wax (stupid candle) i screwed up carving my pumpkin and had to change the design (i didn't wanna do a face but that's what i had to do in the end) and i cut myself carving the damned thing  *sigh* at least i'll have tasty pumpkin seeds tomorrow
2010-10-18 06:36:41 "today felt like a very busy day but i feel like i got nothing done   i don't enjoy that feeling, it's wiggly in a bad way  also my ankle hurts and i don't know why!"

2010-10-29 22:29:58 haha a bunch of web-comic folks put out a independently published book the other day called 'machine of death' and it had the fortune of coming out on the same day as <propfirst> beck's new book and you know what   they beat him they were in the number one spot on amazon for the whole day and he was ticked off about it too  laugh  good one guys!!
2010-11-18 06:11:48 "as i've been writing a picture has formed slowly in my mind   i have tried to resist it, to save it for later, but alas it has taken over and urges me to get it out, to finish it  thus   i draw tonight, rather then write   at least for the time being"
2010-12-05 05:04:40 i baked 8 dozen cookies today  and that was all from one batch of dough   that's a lot of gingerbread    now i have to decorate them (perhaps tomorrow)

2010-11-19 05:37:04 left over curry and rice + apple juice = midnight snack of champions    ?
2010-11-20 06:28:24 my knees have been sore lately ;_; i think it's from the weight of my computer and lap desk combined with the way i sit on the couch   when i lay on the couch i'm okay though
2010-11-17 08:44:35 "i don't know why, but i love the tyrano castle theme from chrono trigger  it's one of my favorite songs from that game "
2010-11-06 04:57:41 "13,988 words  not bad, not bad  according to the site if i keep this up i should have 50,000 by the 18th, that would be nutty   but now i will try and work on things i actually get paid for some more, i want to get as much done as i can so i have more free time for writing (and drawing)"
2010-11-07 03:16:41 haha i am totally using the names of super minor greek demigods as the names of spells  i'm such a nerd
2010-11-04 07:01:12 "made it to 9,194 tonight   tempted to try and break 10,000 but it's already about 3 am   i guess i can do it in the morning afternoon and meet my goal of 10,000 on day 4 instead of 5^^ i'm 2,526 words ahead of schedule  love 3 i'm not sure how i managed to do that and get to 30 drawings for my uk client (i've got 100 done, 100 to go) and bake a cake all in one day but i'm hoping i'll keep it up"
2010-12-09 07:49:09 "<propmale> the lab guy's action catch phrase    ""there's nothing i can do """
2010-11-18 01:01:21 i just made the most delicious gingerbread cookies   they are so freaking good and spicey  love 3
2010-11-14 03:23:18 "30,504  not terrible  broke 30,000 before the end of day 13, i'd say that is fairly good   <propmale> isn't far behind me though!"
2010-12-29 14:37:43 it's only wed and i already have six images for this friday's <propmale> blog post   it's nice to have proper stuff to share again 
2010-11-10 00:24:58 "taking a break from noveling to start dinner! currently at 22,119 words   so far my favorite character to write for is kennin, the main female's guardian  he's come out so whiny, haha   also, my new profile pic is super amazing, look at it and be awed "
2010-12-11 20:40:33 kinda not liking the whole status not being at the top of one's <propfemale> on the new profile   it's obnoxious  i'd like to see it right under my name and right above all the little tidbit info
2010-10-20 06:27:10 there is some crazy dog or cat upstairs and it keeps dashing all over their living-room   it's ridiculously loud and at 2 smile 0 in the morning quite annoying  i hope it won't be doing this while <propmale>'s mom is here because i'd hate for it to keep her up at night
2010-11-13 06:17:06 "29,692, so close to 30,000! i will break it tomorrow, no prob! but now i must contemplate the next happenings and also maybe draw"
2010-12-06 09:43:26 "'why'd you do that to me <propfemale>? you hurt my beautiful, precious leg and you damaged my beautiful chair '"
2010-11-05 22:52:26 the keyboard and trackpad on my macbook keep screwing up and not responding  they work once i shut down and restart but it's sort of   well   obnoxious   i think it's openoffice or maybe x11 (which is required to run openoffice) doing it   i've been having a lot of issues with my compy lately (it doesn't always charge anymore and now this) and i can't afford a new one!
2010-11-21 05:36:51 "ho hum   i'm at 41,586 words and, though i know what i want to happen next (omg guys a character totally is about to die) i'm struggling to work out the exact how that the guy doing the killing does it  well, i mean, i know how i just don't the finer points of the procedure "
2010-11-16 07:46:58 "broke 35000 today (35,069 46 pages to be exact) and have completely changed some of the relationships between a few of the characters   i won't go back and fix everything that needs fixed now but i'm going to have a lot of work to get that done after i'm finished with the draft   <propfemale> sigh   the way i'm doing it now works so much better in the long run but it's so much extra work, haha"
2010-11-03 21:56:19 "busy busy busy, i baked a cake today (pumpkin!) made some cream cheese frosting for it, made pumpkin juice, and cut out some cute fondant decorations for the cake, thus staining my hands purple and green (because i colored the fondant obviously)   now i have to do some actual work and i don't wanna  laugh "
2010-11-25 18:15:21 happy feasting day everyone!  i've got me some crazy cooking to do today  laugh 
2010-11-06 18:20:57 i wanted to know how many more images (rather then clips) i needed to draw and when i counted them up they came to 42  haha  42 is the best answer 
2011-01-03 09:11:01 "internet seems to have returned sadly mail com, where my default personal email is seems to be down and has been since the brief time i was on hours ago   if, for any reason someone needs to get a hold of me message me here instead^^"
2011-01-08 08:42:02 watching the old campy 60's batman   robin's strangely feminine legs make me uncomfortable
2011-01-10 04:36:16 "urg, i hate when i have stuff to work on that i want to work on but at the same time don't feel like working on   if that makes sense   perhaps some tea will help, or maybe cocoa"
2010-11-01 07:35:56 "2031 words down so far   only 47,969 to go!"
2010-11-09 05:20:01 "20,968 words  not bad, got almost 3,000 words out tonight  lets see if i can hit 30,000 before the 15th! also, i've been super tired the past few days  i wonder if i'm trying to do too much   "
2010-11-28 21:37:04 "so, when i said i was done with my uk client's project? well i guess i lied, they have a few things that they want adjusted (but are paying me as if i was making fully new images), some extra achievements (easy), and an icon (also easy)  i will do these tomorrow, i shouldn't have any problem getting them all done in one day  today though, i continue to rest"
2011-01-03 02:37:52 our internet has been down all day    i have my doubts it's going to last more then 5 minutes so   yeah  lame 
2010-11-22 05:58:36 "man, so i hit 43,609 tonight (only 6,391 to go!) and things have taken a strange twist that i never planned but that i think really works and should be pretty une playful ected when read   you know, after it's been edited so it all actually goes together properly    my story has a sorta sad-ish ending"
2011-01-18 15:08:41 writing out a comprehensive timeline of certain events that are going to be happening in the comic story    it's fun and slightly challenging to try and figure out how everything fits together
2010-11-29 07:37:49 banana + peanut butter + marshmallows + chocolate sauce = yes
2010-12-28 10:57:01 did i mention that i got the <propmale> of bone today?? it was one of my christmas gifts from <propmale>'s papa and i loves it (as i love all my awesome gifts this year!) it's sooo beautiful and has such awesome information in it! i can't believe that i lived in the same city as that man for 4 years (or that he attended ccad for a short time!)
2011-02-13 22:37:11 went grocery shopping today and the store was more packed then i've ever seen it! is there something going on that i don't know about?
2011-01-07 02:30:17 what!? pajama jeans??  seriously   watching a commercial for 'jeans' that are made of some weird soft fabric instead of denim    i don't know how to feel about this 
2011-02-07 04:37:53 "okay   okay   i have everything done for the iphone game (pending any adjustments that might need done) *breathes sigh of relief* tomorrow i am doing no work at all, just stuff for me and lounging   tuesday i will get back to work on freelance stuff "
2010-11-27 20:57:38 "i think my tummy is a bit upset because of stress   this was a very hectic month, i look forward to relaxing a bit and just chilling   maybe i'll read a bit^^"
2010-12-17 22:00:42 cookie tins sent! watercolor paintings sent! all that's left is to finish <propmale>'s christmas gift!
2010-11-28 05:19:36 "a day of rest has been enjoyable! read all of 'the wee free men' by <propfirst> pratchett, watched krillin get blown up, goku go super saiyan, ate some pizza and got a bunch of ref of people kissing because i don't know how to draw that and i have a cute idea for a picture   i like relaxing, i should do it more often"
2010-11-26 03:09:52 "tell me what you're thankful for! i'm thankful for all the normal stuff, good friends, family, my sweet love, a cozy home to live in, and delicious food to eat! however, i'm also thankful for stupid stuff like dbz <propfemale>, the 25th anniversary of super <propfirst> brothers, that next month i'll have time to play video games again, and for the pie that's in the fridge^^"
2011-01-16 15:49:58 it's weird getting up around 8ish every day now  it's not even 11 yet and i feel like it should be at least 1 or 2
2010-12-28 22:43:17 "haha i just had someone tell me that my character bluu looks a lot like me    duh! hahahahha, i'd have sworn i'm mentioned tons of times that the pirate characters of mostly based off my friends and i  laugh "

2011-01-27 18:54:18 "so i like to find new web comics to read every now and again, today i found one called 'calamities of nature' which i don't find particularly funny, insightful, or even all that well drawn   however, going through some of the strips and reading the comments people have left on them, i've realized that it is a flocking point for the pretentious and egotistical "
2011-01-24 21:20:21 "the weather is making me feel really nostalgic for <propmale>     i wanna to go to <propfemale>'s icecream shop, or walk past the lions with the lions on it, and the lions in it, ride the bus past mount doom and all of that fun stuff    "
2011-01-09 04:35:13 "the track lights in our livingroom have finally been replaced thanks to <propmale>'s papa! the room is like   three times brighter now, it's almost weird  laugh "
2011-01-10 07:22:41 omg sweet bologna sandwich how i love to eat you on your tasty potato bread with a creamy slice of cheese 
2011-02-04 02:59:38 it is always a relief to get the work i want to do done   only one or two more days worth of iphone game stuff to do and i'll be completely done^^ i can't wait to buy a new battery for my computer with the money!

2011-04-26 22:09:55 "so all my married friends   do you guys still wear your engagement rings alongside your wedding rings? i was never planning on it, i didn't even realize that was the 'norm ' my engagement ring is lovely but it's also rather large and i know two rings on that finger will be too much for me, but my mom seems to think it's strange that i won't be wearing both  do you guys think it really matters?"
