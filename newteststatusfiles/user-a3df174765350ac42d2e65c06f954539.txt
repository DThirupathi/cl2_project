2011-06-17 06:19:15 i don't understand how its harder for me to go to sleep when i'm bored 
2011-06-18 03:27:37 nothing like having a deep conversation with someone who understands you 
2011-06-23 22:58:30 "apparently, if you are a vegetarian, you can't eat skittles "
2011-06-26 03:25:05 starting to wonder what in the hell made me think being here was going to be better  this place is fucking horrible  never been this agitated in my life

2011-07-21 21:40:52 lost my train of thought  probably fell under the couch or somethin 
2011-07-22 20:42:45 nothing makes my already ruined mood better than sittin in a cold house with everyone sleep 
2011-07-22 22:45:25 feeling the need to announce how mature you are to everyone is a sign that you aren't really that mature 
2011-07-23 02:12:53 "play it cool, here come the space cops "

2011-08-21 10:28:37 "i know there's a such thing as a superiority complex, but is there a such thing as inferiority complex  if so, i think i have it a little "
