2011-04-11 22:11:12 "hmmm    kinda stuck  idk if my calculus solution is correct for my paper    it seems logical, yet i have my feelings of doubt because the answer seems too readily available  well, guess i'll just have to turn on the music and work on it again "
2011-04-12 15:16:32 i find it funny when i refuse to answer questions in class  then we get to sit in an awkward silence until the professor gives an answer  does no one ever read their psychology book?
2011-04-12 20:15:53 "my status    hmmm    uped my workout from 3 days a week to 4  3 out of the 4 speakers in my car seem to have gone out, and it makes my sad  my tickets still have not arrived in the mail for my concert  and tomorrow is gonna be a nice day of relaxation "

2011-04-28 01:38:01 i'm feeling mischievous for no reason  this can't be a good thing  smile 
2011-04-28 16:50:32 question: why is it necessary for me to do 2 psychology papers when in fact i have enough extra credit in the class from the professor to still pass with an a? how about because it isn't necessary and i won't be wasting my time with that crap  i have much more fun things to do  smile 
2011-04-28 20:52:14 "ordered the tickets to lazerfest  why must machines make things so difficult? $57 bye bye, but another memorable e playful erience is bound to come  have to pick up my tickets at a yonkers or something i guess  you people better get your tickets, cuz i'm not afraid to go alone lol"

2011-05-07 19:35:11 "you know i can never prove this solution;you arenâ€™t the one that i thought you were;and so i learn to embrace this illusion,the line that separates- it starts to blur;you tear me down and then you pick me up,you take it all and say itâ€™s not enough,you try to tell me you can heal me,but iâ€™m still bleeding and youâ€™ll bethe death of me!--red"
2011-05-09 08:36:40 i enjoy serious talk time and mess around talk time
