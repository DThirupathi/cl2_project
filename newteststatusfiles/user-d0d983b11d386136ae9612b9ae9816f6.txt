2011-08-11 16:34:52 "the world teaches <propfemale> to whose who are willing to listen   individuals who lie silently in wait awaiting freedom from purgatory, a kind of prison where they must subsist off of nothing   they lie dormant awaiting salvations light, freedom from shackles that bind you for what seems an eternity  "
2011-08-11 16:35:04 "solace does not exist in this state, only sorrow and agony day by day, night by night immense agony, finally freed from these shackles it leaves its <propfirst> scarring the individual leaving wounds that do not heal      "
2011-08-11 16:36:16 "hahahahaha a bit exaggerated purgatory is not what it seems   dont try to understand this just read i for you could not even begin to fathom the meaning of these words     im coming home   hahahaha     the path ahead is what lies before me, my life  odd isnt it, odd that you could never understand the plight of those trapped, and the release of freedom    a saving light of redemption, ill see you soon  "

2011-08-19 04:25:40 the greatest part of retiring for the night is the realization of the notion that you will wake to see the light of day welcome you from your slumber anew    goodnight

2011-09-17 01:09:35 isn't it quite odd?? the capacity of hypocrisy humans bear    their propensity towards hastening their fall    and when they suffer the call for <propfemale> in hopes of cleansing their venality  hm egregious
