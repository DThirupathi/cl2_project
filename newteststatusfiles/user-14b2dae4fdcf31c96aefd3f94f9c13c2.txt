2011-03-08 14:30:02 i may think i feel love but it is love that feels me constantly testing the woven fibers that enclose and protect my heart with a searing flame that allows no illusion of separation  and as the insubstantial fabric of my inner fortress is peeled away by the persistent fire i desperately try to save some charred remains by escaping into one more dream of passion i may think i can find love but it is love that finds me
2011-03-08 18:05:53 " love  im going to take a nap, tuesdays are blah  my phone's on so message me if u want otherwise ill be in a lovely dreamworld   smile   love "
2011-03-09 13:31:21 simply resting from a full day of resting feeling too rested to even consider anything more  simply quiet staying in the silent pauses no thought not even the idea: no thought  too busy doing nothing to stop long enough to do something less-quoted by nirmala
2011-03-11 22:49:11 "the room is empty except for these saddened eyes that find refuge in emptiness  friends come and go lovers come and go but love itself never wavers  emptiness is my refuge emptiness is my resting place everywhere i turn, the end of boundaries awaits  take sadness now take happiness also leave only clear vision-nirmala"
