2011-03-11 22:36:54 "tv news programs about ""media entertainment"" are stupid  how could those ""reporters"" possibly be talking about stupid and irrelevant celebrities like <propfirst> bieber or <propfirst> lohan when there are disastrous things occurring and good people dying in the real world? omfg, it blows my mind "
2011-03-13 23:14:11 "you're an idiot if you compare <propfemale> harbor to japan's tsunami earthquake  realize: 1) everyone fucked over someone in this world, 2) current victims in japan are not responsible for <propfemale> harbor, 3) this is not ""<propfemale>"" for anything  not all japanese attacked <propfemale> harbor (some fought for usa); e g  just how not all whites participated in slavery  (where's those haoles' <propfemale>?) don't link irrelevant shit together!"

2011-03-17 23:29:35 "thinks it's annoying when random classmates (but not friends) ask me, ""what did you get on your test assignment?"" because 85% of the time, they use that question to show off their score grade  a girl told me, ""yeah, i'm doing really awesome in all those classes and i got a 114 on the exam "" glad to know you got an ""a"" on class performance but how about you aim for an ""a"" in life humility   "
2011-03-17 23:33:16 "omg, the same guy that hit on me on new year's hit on me when i was sitting by a bus stop  he kept asking if i wanted to go to his house (apparently it's ""fun"") that night and today, he asked if i wanted a ride    on his one-seater bike  for a bald, cock-eyed guy that likes to flirts on a crappy bike, he sure has a lot of confidence  +1 for guts but, -100 for your creepiness  -___-"

2011-03-25 05:08:55 """baby ??? ??????? so come on now and ?????~""  smile "
2011-03-25 09:46:55 "sometimes, certain people complain of friendships, relationships, work and school events ""disappearing"" or ""not happening"" without ever deeply reflecting about ""how and why am i here"" or ""how and why do i want to get there"" and rather, blame irrelevant things or other persons  everyone has their ups and downs but you're only making it worse with negative thinking and lack of action   "
2011-03-27 10:14:55 "there are some truly amazing and beautiful people in this world  though i feel inferior sometimes, i'm thankful they exist because it makes me have hope in humanity and fuels my passion to help the universe  one positive person compensates for a hundred negative ones  spread light in life~"
