2011-09-25 17:57:25 "at a walmart store, a cashier hands this little boy some money back  the boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old  the cashier said, 'i'm sorry, but you don't have enough money to buy this doll '                 then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him, ''granny, are you sure i don't have enough money?'' the old lady replied, ''you know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear '' then she asked him to stay there for just 5 minutes while she went to look around  she left quickly  the little boy was still holding the doll in his hand  a lady walked toward him and asked him who he wished to give this doll to  'it's the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for christmas  she was sure that <propfemale> claus would bring it to her ' she replied to him that maybe <propfemale> claus would bring it to her after all, and not to worry  but he replied back sadly  'no, <propfemale> claus can't bring it to her where she is now  i have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there ' his eyes were so sad while saying this, 'my sister has gone to be with god  dad dy says that mommy is going to see god very soon too, so i thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister '' my heart nearly stopped  the little boy looked up at the lady and said, 'i told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet  i need her to wait until i come back from the mall ' then he showed her a very nice photo of himself  he was laughing  he then told me 'i want mommy to take my picture with her so she won't forget me ' 'i love my mommy and i wish she didn't have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister ' then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly  she quickly reached for her wallet and said to the boy  'suppose we check again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll!'' ok' he said, 'i hope i do have enough ' she added some of her money to his without him seeing and they started to count it  there was enough for the doll and even some spare money  the little boy said, 'thank you god for giving me enough money!' then he looked at the lady and added, 'i asked last night before i went to sleep for god to make sure i had enough money to buy this doll, so that mommy could give it to my sister  he heard me!'' 'i also wanted to have enough money to buy a white <propfemale> for my mommy, but i didn't dare to ask god for too much  but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a white <propfemale> '' 'my mommy loves white <propfemale>s ' a few minutes later, the boys granny returned and the lady left with her basket  she finished her shopping in a totally different state of mind from when she started  she couldn't get the little boy out of her mind  then she remembered a local newspaper article two days ago, which mentioned a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl  the little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state  the family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma  was this the family of the little boy? two days after this encounter with the little boy, the woman read in the newspaper that the young woman had passed away  she couldn't stop herself as she bought a bunch of white <propfemale>s and went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was for people to see and make last wishes before her burial  she was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white <propfemale> in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest  she left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that her life had been changed forever  the love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine, and in a fraction of a second, a drunk driver had taken all this away from him  now you have 2 choices: 1) send this message to others, or 2) ignore it as if it never touched your heart  the quote of the month is by <propfirst> leno, 'with hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to the other, and with the threat of swine flu and terrorist attacks, are we sure this is a good time to take god out of the pledge of allegiance?' for those who prefer to think that god is not watching over us delete this, for the others, pass it on! god bless you"
2011-09-25 17:59:16 "a little boy asked his mother, ""why are you crying?"" ""because i'm a woman,"" she told him  ""i don't understand,"" he said  his mom just hugged him and said, ""and you never will "" ""all women cry for no reason,"" was all his dad could say  the little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry  finally he put in a call to god  when god got on the phone, he asked, ""god, why do women cry so easily?"" god said: ""when i made the woman she had to be special  i made her shoulders strong enough to <propfemale> the weight of the world, yet gentle enough to give comfort  i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children  i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining  i gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly  i gave her strength to <propfemale> her man through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart  i gave her wisdom to know that a good man never hurts his woman, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly  and finally, i gave her a tear to shed  this is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed "" ""you see my son,"" said god, ""the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair  the beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart -the place where love resides "" please read this and inform the beautiful women you know today  you will boost another woman's self-esteem"
