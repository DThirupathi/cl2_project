2009-10-18 23:40:38 "the silent one forever protecting those along the path, quietly steering all towards their destination; hidden from view yet all sense his presence; the silent one stands before you now, seeking redemption, seeking peace; shining bright and anew, a beacon within the dark, a soul appears full of spark, flames of red embrace the glowing embers blue; to see it on its journey the silent one stands true"
2009-10-20 23:30:53 "choices made by others it seems my happiness to them it deems, new light to unfold as choices again become bold, to what corpse  lay bear, to what corpse  lay my tear, scorched in cleansing awaiting its message, flaming rebirth brings its passage, to what end lay the bear, to what end lay the bear"
2009-09-24 03:03:43 when faced with your single greatest fear   the best answer i've heard yet is to face your fear head-on   change your circumstances to either overcome and defeat your fear or remove the fear altogether   the one thing you can continue to control is how you respond to your fear   now all i have to do is figure out how i will respond to mine   
2009-10-20 01:31:39 "happiness it seems beyond my dreams to share my life with those in flight my curse and my deed; guiding the lost guiding those that stray nay not from the light but from life as i do plead; forgotten my curse banishment my fate, solitude my creed but by far not my need"
2009-10-17 21:53:47 "casting light to guide the lost, protecting the innocent from harsh brutality, standing firm to guard the weak, who remembers the silent ones, who remembers those that help others on their journey, when will it be time for them to share the bounty, to reap the rewards of love and compassion"
2009-10-12 00:01:24 "forbidden from knowing, yet forever seeking   the path before me i do not recognize, the path behind me broken and unpassable   haphazardly we go into the unknown, the treasures of friends young and old   the only real treasure one can hold"
2009-10-28 23:24:04 "peace love happiness   finding peace is easy   just don't piss me off too much   finding love is hard   how people define love differs, some say it for the wrong reasons, others don't say for the right reasons   finding happiness can be easy or hard   usually follows with the other two, and its a benefit  for living a good life   living a good life can be the easy or hard part   where do your morals stand?"
2009-10-22 19:21:00 "away i go to thoughts untold, secrets are found by those who are bold, kept by me through time of old, elixir of youth wasted in time, captured the soul only to be lost, four days hence we can recompense"
2009-10-27 23:42:39 "realized how important it can be to see a <propfirst> of sunshine everyday, whether that <propfirst> comes from the sun or the smiling face of a friend does not matter, making each of us a phoenix in our own right "

2009-10-14 22:49:50 "to travel in time the choice would be, twenty years for me   but to change the past or simply be twenty again is the delimma of the task"
2009-10-24 04:57:06 "seeking happiness is a difficult task, finding happiness is nearly impossible for even the most ardent of adventurers, secrets held and secrets told, knowing not the truth be told, what do you do when the path to happiness contradicts principles, rules, laws, and morales?  maybe it's time to redefine those principles, rules, and morales   or redefine happiness to remove the conflict?"
