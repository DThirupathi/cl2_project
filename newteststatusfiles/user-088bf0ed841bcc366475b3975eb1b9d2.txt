2010-08-10 13:43:11 why do i always get depressed after finishing a series? it's gotten to the point that when i know i'm near the end i put off finishing it  i have books i started years ago that i've always been meaning to go back and finish  sometimes i think it's because i get emotionally attached to the characters and if i finish the series we will never have any new interactions 
2010-08-02 07:53:02 the devils advocate is pretty good 
2011-01-17 05:05:09 i've noticed that a lot of ska songs feel like they're building up and then while still in the process of building up all that energy and potential just sort of disperses it to no affect

2011-02-04 06:13:34 false alarm  not depressed just physically sick  odd makes it so i have to judge emotions based off physical reactions that my body makes so i assumed my stomach being in turmoil was because i was depressed    turns out it's because i'm an idiot who thought they don't put enough real cheese inside pizza rolls to set off my allergy!  laugh

2010-11-10 09:37:24 why is it that no matter how my life is actually going i'm almost always depressed for a reason i can't seem to put my finger on  or maybe i'm just confusing boredom with depression    i may do that because i find when i'm depressed i tend to be bored  can't think of anything to do! and i be unhappy 
2010-10-25 01:55:23 i just got a job! and i didn't even have to apply for it!
