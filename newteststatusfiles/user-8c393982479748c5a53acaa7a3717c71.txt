2011-08-26 02:21:30 "confession 2: i have divided my ""good"", ""dark"", mature, childish, and sexual sides of me into separate personalities  it's not likely anyone will see more than 2 of those and only 3 at the most  not something i'm really proud of  _  but if you ever find me confusing this is why  i tend to contradict myself in every way possible due to this as well "
2011-08-26 03:35:48 confession 3: i am completely obsessed with bleach which is an anime  i love anime and manga as well  i have been following it for a long time and am up to date with it which the latest chapter as of yesterday is chapter 461 and i have watched the anime at least 5 times and still love it   love  i even have an replica of ichigo's bankai sword tensa zangetsu above my bed ^^ *proud nerd*
