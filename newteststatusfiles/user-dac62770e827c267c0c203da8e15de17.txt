2011-02-11 19:36:51 i feel like i have been hit by a <propmale> truck this new work out is killin me lol
2011-02-14 00:28:56 <propfirst> bieber  i dont care wat anyone says he is talented he has a future ahead of him and at least he has his head straight for now lol lets hope dat he keeps it dat way and not give in to the pressure like all of our fallin actors we all have loved even our musicians
2011-02-14 14:29:54 i know you cant read this but i love you baby and i cant wait to talk to you on this day of love
2011-02-04 07:10:15 only blockin or deletin people if they cant keep it real be a real nigga not a hata
2011-02-05 03:41:28 just talked to my baby not long enough but good to hear his voice its a wonder wat love can do and you also realize how much you do love someone once they are gone <propfemale> your significate other dont waste it fighting or bein suspicious be happy god granted you a child of his to love
2011-02-05 14:25:37 fear not tomorrow  for god is already there 
2011-02-11 04:33:25 when does the cycle of trust ever end  when do the words i love you really mean wat they should  how do you ease someones mind who cannot not be there physically that your words are true  does that mean if your not trusted or they have thoughts of miss trust that its your fault  why cant things be excepted for the love thats in front of you instead of analyzed  maybe past hurt really does sink bone deep 
2011-02-15 22:38:08 too tired to deal with anything or anyone who has attitude im so emotionally drained its crazy
2011-01-23 23:17:44 sittin here thinkin enough for a hundred people wishin he was home    lets go pittsburgh beat em jets!!!
2011-02-11 04:47:37 want to sleep but knowing there are things left unsaid is driving me crazy why cant people just stay out of business that aint there its so frustrating 
2010-12-13 15:06:32 pay day more money gone to bills at least i see my babies
2011-02-14 01:38:38 i love him so much it hurts my soul it makes my heart ache hopefully da lord will will not keep him there and settle my heart and will not take
2011-02-15 15:21:03 it has been years and still i am hated by those i love life is too short to be angry or upset bout past things that were said or done but i guess some people just cant let go of the past
2011-02-15 15:29:08 decided on my new tat really thinking bout gettin it on da back of my neck but not sure i like the forearm as well
2011-02-15 02:52:46 waitin for my phone call and then going to try and sleep if my mind lets me happy v day everyone
