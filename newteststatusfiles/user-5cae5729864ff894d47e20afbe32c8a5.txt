2010-10-29 04:17:02 "it makes me sad when people are content to just complain  no understanding, no focus on the good, no empathy for others, no drive to change what they can in the situation or at least their attitude ~ what kind of way is that to live??"
2010-09-06 16:50:38 "not to complain or anything, lol, but it bugs me that our ap english teachers couldn't give us a more original summer assignment than a book report!!!!! that is about as generic and <propfemale> - creative as it gets  blehh  so i will try and make it creative   maybe make it into a poem or something hah"
2010-10-26 05:32:02 "is finally letting go of that fear to get close to others  i look around at school, at youth group, and see so many faces, but have not started truly seeing them till now   and i want them to see my face too  the masks are peeling away  god is good   love "

2010-09-09 06:45:19 "tailgate party was amazing chris was right about how we need to get actively involved in our community  i think it would be good to have some concrete goals for this, not just saying something vague like 'to serve the community,' but 'reach out to one person at school today and ask how they are doing' or something  starting small is okay!"
