"let me get this straightâ€¦ <propfirst> sheen can make a â€œporn familyâ€�, <propfemale> grammar can end a 15 year marriage over the phone, <propfirst> <propmale> can be on divorce #9, <propfemale> spears can have a 55 hour marriage, and <propfirst> <propfirst> and tiger woods, while married, were having sex with everyone  yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage? really? repost if you are proud to support equal rights "
"a 15 year old girl holds hands with her 1 year old son  people call her a slut, but no one knows she was raped at 13  people call another guy fat  no one knows he has a serious disease causing him to be overweight  people call an old man ugly  no one knew he had a serious injury to his face while fighting for our country in the war  repost this if you are against bullying and stereotyping  i bet 96% of you won't "
"stupid cancer    we all want a new car    a new phone    freedom    a person who has cancer only wants one thing    to survive  i know a lot of you ""who think you're too cool"" probably won't repost this  but a very little amount of my friends will  put this on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer, survived, or who is fighting against it now"
