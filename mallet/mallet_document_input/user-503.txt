starting from scratch
i can't wait for spring break back at cocoa beach just    freakin' everybody out 
finally jumped in the pool today
gave each other massages in speech class today   
made a big mistake  only have myself to blame
time to leave the cave and get some sun at the beach  smile 
blueberry
"take my hand, come with me on this adventure "
had a french toast breakfast and my class was canceled   i can already tell today will be a good day 
"oh heart, you let me down"
so glad i took that emergency communications class! it was so much fun!
i'm starting to miss the old me
