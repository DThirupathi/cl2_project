is it wrong to keep something from an old relationship when you are in a serious long term relationship? even if you dont like that person anymore? what if someone you know does that? how do you know that they dont like that person anymore? what if they do? what if they still love them just a little bit? should that be confronted? give me some feedback  comment please!!
may say something brilliant at any moment  wait for it    wait for it    ah nope i got nothin'
