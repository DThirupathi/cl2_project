"father's day is approaching  yellow roses grow in heaven, lord pick a bunch for me  place them in my daddy's hands and tell him they're from me  tell him that i love and miss him  when he turns to smile, place a kiss upon his cheek & hold him for awhile, because remembering him is easy, i do it every day  there's an ache in my heart that will never go away    if your dad is in heaven, copy & paste this"
"got <propfirst>'s flowers for father's day yesterday   waiting on them to be delivered today   i think it would make him proud to know that i went with guy colors and not pink lol   i could talk him into almost anything but the color pink, i tried painting the office pink, tried ordering pink shrits and hats, and tried to get him to buy a pink 18 wheeler and he just wouldn't have it lol   good times and great memories!!!"
"thought for the day: never tell someone ""everything happens for a reason"" unless you can back it with the information that its either for the bad or the good  if you cant give that kinda information to go with the saying then dont say it at all, because it becomes a pointless statement and an endless waiting game "
<propfirst> dunn just walked on stage   hell yeah!!!
"is going off the mnt  then back home to swim, swim, swim, swim, and swim  smile "
"think, think, think  it will hurt like hell at first, but you will get used to it  -<propfemale> castle, british politician "

"   all u folks think i've got my price, at which i'll sell all that is mine  u think money rules when all else fails, go sell ur soul and keep ur shell  i'm trying to protect  what i keep inside, all the reasons y i live my life   "

"thought 4 the day: everybody in this community has something to hide  u know how difficult it is to hide anything in a small commuity   everybody knows everybody else's business, but u don't know all of it  so this makes for a very paranoid place "

"i've heard thats it's possible to grow up  i've just never met anyone who has actually done it  w o parents to defy, we break the rules we make for ourselves  we throw tantrums when things don't go our way  we whisper secrets with our best friends in the dark  we look for comfort where we can find it  and we hope against all logic, against all e playful erience  like childern we never give up hope "
"much to my dismay, my laundry did not sort, wash, dry, and put its self away  you would think after the long talk we had this morning that it would have done as i had asked  yes, i'm the psycho who has full on conversations with inadament objects "
