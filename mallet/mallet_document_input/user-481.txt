"night with me lasses, oh aye ;p"
"eeenie meenie minie fish  holla, holla, holla "
"y'know when you go to your mates ""just for a couple of hours"" & stroll in home the next morning "
"as if mother got me out of bed just to see the dresses  i mean hey, she looks great but i'd rather sleep than watch them get married "
"so osama bin laden is dead  well, there's no possible way there could ever be a backlash right? don't start celebrating too soon   "
"y'know, someone could have pointed out that me eye makeup had smudged so i look like <propfemale> cooper  cheers for lettin' iz just walk around unaware guys "
"kathryn: ""it looks african, y'know like some ropey leather thing you would knit in the dessert """
would like nothing better than to sit outside in the sun with an ice cold mojito right now 
"""if i never lied then baby you'd be the truth"" wait    what? seriously, what the hell does that even mean?"
"forget having a social life, i'm playing mortal kombat "
someone come make me breakfast & then maybe just do everything else i need to do today so i can go back to bed 
in exactly 45 days i shall be perfectly happy
