"it is never easy for someone to recognize they need something good in their life  what doesn't make sense is that they continue to say what they want and never realize it is right in front of their face all along   then, when the person leaves is when they realize, it was they who they needed from the beginning   if that person moved on, they missed their <propmale> for having that person as a blessing in their life"
