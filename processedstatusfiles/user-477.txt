since

3

been
about

the
dreams
always
end
either
before
they
get
on
stage

right
when
they
're
about

so
i
wake
up
in
the

of
one
today
and
tell
myself
it
's
gunna
finish
when
i
go
back
to
sleep

and
it
did
!
they
played
whole
lotta
<

,
&
then
it
ended
in
a
nightmare
!
but
then
<
propfirst

<

sat
next
to
me
&
i
got
to
talk
to
him
so
it
's
okay

just
actually
realized
what
i
said

tackled
one
of
the
``

monsters
''
''
in
the
back
room
.
i
do
n't
remember
if
he
got
in
trouble
...
.
but
it
was
awesome
laugh
``
okay
.
finally
back
.
now
to
do
tons
of
work
on
deviantart
and
find
food
before
i
pass
out
!
and
halloween
shopping
tomorrow
!
!
yaaaaaaaay
``
whoa
...
i
just
found
my
8th
grade
report
card
,
my
scores
from
the
iowa
test
,
and
all
the
awards
i
got
at
8th
grade
graduation
.
the
most
entertaining
thing
to
look
at
is
definitely
my
grades
for
science
because
i
tell
which
quarter
i
helped
<

sadler
bug
the
crap
out
of
mr.

;
i
got
a

category

``
the
cohoes
fd
really
stepped
it
up
to
help
the
families
who
were
victims
of
the
main
street
fire
.
they
deserve
a
lot
more
credit
than
the
city
sometimes
gives
them
.
``
so
in
the
end
,
i
will
be
what
i
will
be
.
``
``
i
think
one
day
i
want
to
try
my
hand
at
tattoo
designs
...
not
only
because
it
's
cool
,
but
searching
tattoos
on
deviantart
makes
me
lose
faith
in
human
beings
power
of
choice
and
discretion
.
some
of
those
tattoos
are
ridiculous
and
can
not
possibly
be
meaningful
enough
that
they
will
be
glad
in
30
years
that
they
got
it
-_-
i
hate
when
people
get
tattoos
for
no
reason
