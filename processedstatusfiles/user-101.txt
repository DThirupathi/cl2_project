``
funny
of
day
:
a
preacher
trained
his
horse
to
go
when
he
said
,
``
''
praise
the
lord
,
''
''
and
to
stop
when
he
said
,
``
''
amen
''
''
.
the
horse
started
going
toward
the
edge
of
the
<
propmale

.
the
preacher
got
excited
and
said
,
``
''
whoa
!
''
''
.
then
he
remembered
and
said
,
``
''
amen
''
''
,
so
the
horse
stopped
at
the
edge
.
the
preacher
was
so
relieved
that
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
said
,
``
''
praise
the
lord
!

supervisor
said
he
put
a
word
for
them
to
keep
me

the
only
reason
i
would
stay
is
because
after
three
months
of
work
,
you
get
a
automatic
raise
in
salary
.
yeah
.
they
lay
you
off
right
before
the
raise
so
they
do
n't
lose
money

see
what
happens

i
dont
really
care

story
:
a
new
pastor
in
a
small
oklahoma
town
spent
the
first
four
days
making
personal
visits
to
each
of
the
members
,
inviting
them
to
come
to
his
first
services
.
the
following
sunday
the
church
was
all
but
empty
.
accordingly
,
the
pastor
placed
a
notice
in
the
local
newspapers
,
stating
that
,
because
the
church
was
dead
,
it
was
everyone
's
duty
to
give
it
a
decent
christian
burial
.

i
was

i
held
open
a

for
a
young

she
said

i
said
as
innocent
and
casual
as
possible
,
``
''
your
welcome
pretty

she
must
have
been
offended

she
said
,
``

you
pigs
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
in
a

friday
funny
:
a
young
couple
moves
into
a
new
neighborhood
.
the
next
morning
,
while
they
are
eating
breakfast
,
the
young
woman
sees
her
neighbor
<
propfemale

the
wash
outside
.
that
laundry
is
not
very
clean
,
she
said
,
she
does
n't
know
how
to
wash
correctly
.
perhaps
she
needs
better
laundry
soap
.
her
husband
looked
on
,
but
remained
silent

friday
:
a

were
flying

from
kansas
to
chicago
.
the
son
(
who
had
been
looking
out

window
)
turned
to
his
mother
and
said
,
``
''
if
big
dogs
have
baby
dogs
and
big
cats
have
baby
cats
,
why
do
n't
big
planes
have
baby
planes
?
``

the

who
could
n't
think
of
an
answer
)
told
her
son
to
ask
the
stewardess

changes
came
to
the
nelsons
once
she
was
born
so
we
use
her
age
to
keep
track
of
the
length
of
time
that
the
change
has
been
in
effect

cousins
are
the
1st
friends
of
your
life

cousins
are
there
as
childhood
friends

no
one
will
ever
understand
your
crazy
family
like
your
cousins
...
even
if
you
do
n't
talk
much
lately
...
re-post
this
if
you
have
some
of
the
best
cousins
in
the
world
and
they
know
who
they
are
?
wan
na
read
somethin
dirty
?
no
?
stop
reading
then
...
.ok
you
made
it
this
far
so
here
we
go
:
me
and
my
saxophone
got
into
this
fight
because
my
sax
seems
to
think
that
i
'm
not
blowing
it
's
wood
hard
and
often
enough
for
its
satisfaction
.
ya
know
what
i
mean
?
wink
``
i
told
her
i
was
an
honest
person
.
she
decided
to
test
me
.
she
asks
,
``
''
do
these
pants
make
my
butt
look
fat
?
``
``
i
told
her
yes

she
was
extremely
offended

the
lesson
in
this
is
this
:

it

another
reason
why

oh

i
would
put

then
i
only
have
three

the

would
n't

bad

``
``
i
'll
bet
god
talks
to
himself
since
when
he
talks
to
jesus
and
the
holy
spirit
,
he
's
talking
to
himself
anyway

so
there
is
no
problem
when
i
talk

i
am
two

a

later

i

going

post
on

as
well
as
write
a
note
about
a
possible
overreaction
to
the
9/11
attacks

my
grandmother
was
born
on
9/11
and
has
shown
full
support
on
what
i
'm
going

be
talking
about

i
think
it
's
going
to
be
an
intresting
read
.
it
's
something
many
people
have
not
talked
about
alot

it
's
not

crazy
emotional
ride

i
can
promise
that

one
of

sent
me
back

that
's
it
.
if
im
asked
``
''
how
's
school
<

?
``
``
my
answer
will
either
be
``
''
i
do
n't
know
''
''
or
``

i
do
n't
care

''
.
and
that
's
that

``
yesterday
i
saw
a
chicken
crossing

friends
.
but
once
i
make
one
,
i
'm
extremely
loyal
to
them
.
but
if
they
backstab
me
,
i
'm
not
easily
swayed
to
accept
that
person
in
my
life
again
and
i
usualy
shut
them
out
.
i
always
have
my
family
's
back
as
well
,
but
there
is
a
limit
even
for
them
.
dang
.
``
this
guy
on
xfactor
is
showing
is
nuts
all
over
the
place
.

'm

tomorrow
.
``
``
instructor
''
''
says
if
i
do
n't
bring
my
rough
draft
of
my
paper
,
i
'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
stay
in
class
.
and
my
response
to
that
statement
is
i
really
do
n't
care
.
i
do
n't
have
a
rough
draft
for
a
paper
that
is
due
late
october
because
of
my
other
assignments
that
i
'm
concerned
with
that
are
due
tomorrow
.
i
will
be
kicked
out
of
class
early
.
plain
and
simple
.
and
i
will
be
liking
my
own
status
.

if
you
want
to
be
a
fb
stalker
,
that
``
''
ticker
''
''
on
the
side
really
helps
you
out
.
you
know
when
some
``
''
likes
''
''
something
and
comments
on
everything
.
you
already
can
tell
about
the
profile
pic
change
and
who
the
person
is
friends
with
,
but
now
you
know
even
sooner
.
kinda
creepy
...
then
the
subcribers
thingy
.
sheesh
.
but
it
's
all
good
baby
.
aaaaaaaallllll

!
but
my
week
is
looking
busy
.
but
i
'm
in
a
strangely
good
mood
.
``
i
'm
going
to
be
spending
most
of
my
facebook
time
on
my
pages
.
once
the
pages
are
of
even
greater
quality
,
most
of
my
statuses
will
originate
from
the
pages
.
some
of
the
things
you
'll
be
getting
are
jokes
,
scripture
,
and
news
articles
i
write
.
basically
you
'll
be
getting
a
nice
mix
of
content
from
my
pages
