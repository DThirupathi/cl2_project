why
on

i
'm
pretty
sure
that
blue
cheese
was
mozzarella
a
week
ago
o.o
went
black
friday
shopping
for
the
first
time
ever
!
it
was
intense
!
i
've
never
seen
someone
get
so
angry
about
a
shopping
cart
in
my
life
!
do
you
know
why
they
call
us
'friends
'
because
its
nicer
than
calling
us
'those
2
weirdos
'
``
to
think

not
shine
,
and
the

nothing
but
a
ball
of
cheese

the
wind
would
blow
,
and
in
the
summer
the
snow
would
glow
.
that
brought
the
thoughtful
thinking
for
a
world
of
peace
