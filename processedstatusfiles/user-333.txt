the

twista
meeting

so
what
is
my
belief
then

that
every
person
is
right
in
their
own
praxis

that
merely
existing
subjugates
reality
?
is
so
in
tune
with
the
plight
of
the
working
cat
some
event
is
starting
which
does
not
earn
my
approval
.
i
will
assert
my
disapproval
by
citing
the
feelings
i
have
towards
that
event

rekindled

reality
is
a
function

probability

but
that
's
probably
not
a

outlook
