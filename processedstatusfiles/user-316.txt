i
love
it
*voice
drips
with
sarcasm*
when
you
do
the
right
thing
and
are
crucified
or
ignored
for
it
.
i
stand
by
my
morals
and
i
wo
n't
apologize
since
what
i
did
should
have
been
done
a
long
time
ago
.
misses
everyone
already
...
.and
is
sad
that
she
wo
n't
see
many
of
them
until
late
april
.
*tear*
is
excited
that
she
will
be
in
harlaxton
by
this
time
tomorrow
...
however
is
worried
about
the
excessive
snow
i
was
told
about
by
someone
already
there
.
is
pondering
her
love
of
the
class
she
thought
would
be
boring
and
the
hatred
she
holds
for
the
class
she
thought
she
would
love
.
not
wanting
to
be
in
theatre
and
wishing
things
would
go
right
for
one
second
in
this
bloody
hell
week
realizes
that
she
has
problems/wishes
that
others
would
realize
the
same
thing
.
is
fing
tired
of
people
being
bitchy
just
because
they
do
n't
like
what
is
said
...
if
you
do
n't
like
it
ask
the
person
to
shush
instead
of
being
a
pretentious*****
...
yes
i
'm
indulging
in
a
bout
of
immaturity
but
its
better
than
saying
what
is
on
my
mind
right
now
.
should
just
keep
my
mouth
shut
anyway
.
i
'll
just
end
up
being
the
bad
guy
.
needs
to
stop
updating
her
status
just
because
she
is
pissed
at
the
immaturity
and
rudeness
of
others
.
is
also
excited
about
going
to
scotland
.
glasgow
is
bound
to
be
fantastic
.
is
doing
better
now
that
she
's
in
her

tons
and

...
hate
my
life

been
a
weekend
of

i
say

go
as
planned
for
once
in
my
life

freaking
out
about

paper
because
she
ca
n't
figure
out
what
the
article
means
and
cant
find
another
author
that
makes
sense
either
...
does
n't
know
what
to
do
and
does
n't
know
how
she
's
going
to
get
a
