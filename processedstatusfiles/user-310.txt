many
of
these
new
generation
children
are
very
old
souls
,
some
of
whom
have
never
been
on
the
earth
plane
before
but
who
are
here
to
provide
guidance
and
assistance
as
we
transition
through
these
times
which
are
challenging
but
whose
purpose
is
to
collapse
old
cycles
and
open
pathways
to
other
dimensions
of
being

we
think
that
reality
is
about
â€˜feelingâ€™
but
itâ€™s
really
about
energy
,
where
feelings
mirror
energy
and
energy
creates
our
reality
but
energy
doesnâ€™t
create
feelings
.
they
are
created
based
on
how
we
interpret
the
energy
in
motion
through
our
beliefs
,
thoughts
and
memories
.
feeling
is
an
ego-based
response
to
energy
that
we
think
is
our
reality
