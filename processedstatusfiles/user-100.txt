there
was
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
in
the
fridge
and
a
note
that
said
``
''
do
n't
eat
me
''
''
now
there
's
an
empty
plate
and
a
note
that
says
``
''
do
n't
tell
me
what
to
do

is
very
grateful
to
<
propfemale
>
worthington
for
being
so
generous
with
his
'man
flu
'
and
sharing
it
with
me
-
amazingly
however
i
seem
to
be
immune
from
the
paralyzing
effects
that
nearlly
killed
<
propfemale
>
!
that
would
be
as
a
result
of
him
doing
sod
all
and
me
thinking
of
wringing
his
neck
-
love
you
bf
smile
some
people
should
not
be
seen
and
not
be
heard
would
normally
rather
stick
pins
in
her
eyes
than
go
shopping
but
every
now
and
then
she
has
the
urge
to
splurge
-
tomorrow
could
be
messy
.
enjoyed

window
