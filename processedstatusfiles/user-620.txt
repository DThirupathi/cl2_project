i
pretty
much
just
now
realized
i
basically
raised
my
son
all
by
myself
.
it
's
crazy
to
think
about
man
,
for
real
.
i
never
thought
i
'd
have
to
do
it
alone
,
but
in
the
end
it
's
all
worth
it
.
i
have
my
handsome
son
who
has
my
heart
,
and
he
's
all
i
'll
ever
need
.

just
got
done
watching
this

hilarious

``

'i
never
make
a
promise

do
n't
intend
to
keep

so
when
i
say
forever

forever

what
i
mean

hate
in
my
heart

love
on
my
mind

i
've
seen
nights
full
of
pain
,
and
days
that
are
the
same
.
so
i
keep
the
sunshine
,
and
save
the
rain
.
i
always
search
but
never
find
;
i
hurt
but
never
cry

``
``
i
've
carried
a
child
within
my
body

?
slept
with
them
on
my
chest
.
?
i
've
kissed
there
little
toes
,
and
wiped
away
tears
.
?
i
've
been
vomited
on
,
peed
on
.
and
spent
sleepless
nights
cradling
my
child
,
but
i
would
n't
have
it
any
other
way
.
?
my
body
is
n't
magazine
perfect
,
but
when
i
look
in
the
mirror
i
see
a
mom
,
and
there
is
no
greater
honor

love
or
blessing

post
this

you
're

weeks

you
're
going
to
find
out
about

soon
,
though
,
i

let
me
tell
you
some
things
about
me

my
name
is
<

,
and
i
've
got
beautiful
brown
eyes
and
black
hair
.
well
,
i
do
n't
have
it
yet
,
but
i
will
when
i
'm
born
.
i
'm
going
to
be
your
only
child
,
and
you
'll
call
me
your
one
and
only
.
i
'm
going
to
grow
up
without
a
daddy
mostly
,
but
we
have
each
other
.
we
'll
help
each
other
,
and
love
each
other
.
i
want
to
be
a
doctor
when
i
grow
up
.
you
found
out
about
me
today
,
mommy
!
you
were
so
excited
,
you
could
n't
wait
to
tell
everyone
.
all
you
could
do
all
day
was
smile
,
and
life
was
perfect
.
you
have
a
beautiful
smile
,
mommy
.
it
will
be
the
first
face
i
will
see
in
my
life
,
and
it
will
be
the
best
thing
i
see
in
my
life
.
i
know
it
already
.
...
today
was
the
day
you
told
daddy
.
you
were
so
excited
to
tell
him
about
me
!
...
he
was
n't
happy
,
mommy
.
he
kind
of
got
angry
.
i
do
n't
think
that
you
noticed
,
but
he
did
.
he
started
to
talk
about
something
called
wedlock
,
and
money
,
and
bills
,
and
stuff
i
do
n't
think
i
understand
yet
.
you
were
still
happy
,
though
,
so
it
was
okay
.
then
he
did
something
scary
,
mommy
.
he
hit
you
.
i
could
feel
you
fall
backward
,
and
your
hands
flying
up
to
protect
me
.
i
was
okay
...
but
i
was
very
sad
for
you
.
you
were
crying
then
,
mommy
.
that
's
a
sound
i
do
n't
like
.
it
does
n't
make
me
feel
good
.
it
made
me
cry
,
too
.
he
said
sorry
after
,
and
he
hugged
you
again
.
you
forgave
him
,
mommy
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
if
i
do
.
it
was
n't
right
.
you
say
he
loves
you
...
why
would
he
hurt
you
?
i
do
n't
like
it
,
mommy
.
finally
,
you
can
see
me
!
your
stomach
is
a
little
bit
bigger
,
and
you
're
so
proud
of
me
!
you
went
out
with
your
mommy
to
buy
new
clothes
,
and
you
were
so
so
so
happy
.
you
sing
to
me
,
too
.
you
have
the
most
beautiful
voice
in
the
whole
wide
world
.
when
you
sing
is
when
i
'm
happiest
.
and
you
talk
to
me
,
and
i
feel
safe
.
so
safe
.
you
just
wait
and
see
,
mommy
.
when
i
am
born
i
will
be
perfect
just
for
you
.
i
will
make
you
proud
,
and
i
will
love
you
with
all
of
my
heart
.
i
can
move
my
hands
and
feet
now
,
mommy
.
i
do
it
because
you
put
your
hands
on
your
belly
to
feel
me
,
and
i
giggle
.
you
giggle
,
too
.
i
love
you
,
mommy
.
daddy
came
to
see
you
today
,
mommy
.
i
got
really
scared
.
he
was
acting
funny
and
he
was
n't
talking
right
.
he
said
he
did
n't
want
you
.
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
that
's
what
he
said
.
and
he
hit
you
again
.
i
got
angry
,
mommy
.
when
i
grow
up
i
promise
i
wo
n't
let
you
get
hurt
!
i
promise
to
protect
you
.
daddy
is
bad
.
i
do
n't
care
if
you
think
that
he
is
a
good
person
,
i
think
he
's
bad
.
but
he
hit
you
,
and
he
said
he
did
n't
want
us
.
he
does
n't
like
me
.
why
does
n't
he
like
me
,
mommy
?
you
did
n't
talk
to
me
tonight
,
mommy
.
is
everything
okay
?
it
's
been
three
days
since
you
saw
daddy
.
you
have
n't
talked
to
me
or
touched
me
or
anything
since
that
.
do
n't
you
still
love
me
,
mommy
?
i
still
love
you
.
i
think
you
feel
sad
.
the
only
time
i
feel
you
is
when
you
sleep
.
you
sleep
funny
,
kind
of
curled
up
on
your
side
.
and
you
hug
me
with
your
arms
,
and
i
feel
safe
and
warm
again
.
why
do
n't
you
do
that
when
you
're
awake

any
more
