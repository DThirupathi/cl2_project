of

``

what
did

do

deserve
this

the

so
sore
from

nice
to
help
a
friend
though
i
'd
hate
to
see
him
do
it
alone
cuz
nobody
else
was
home
.
as
i
observed
couples
i
have
noticed
the
only
ones
that
last
long
are
the
couples
that
think
differently
but
the
same
.
one
thinks
of
i
deas
and
the
other
takes
action
of
those
ideas
.
there
's
more
to
it
so
this
is
just
the
basic
``
i
know
my
mom
is
awesome
,
but
do
n't
call
her
your
mom
.
she
's
my
mom
!
i
'm
doing
my
best
for
her
and
there
is
no
way
,
anyone
can
top
it
.
laugh
i
loves
ya
mom

``
``
so
many
failing
to
realize
why
the
optimistic
are
so
happy
,
it
's
because
they
put
their
passion
into
what
they
want
by
feeling
happy
.
the
pessimistic
are
always
gon
na
have
something
to
complain
about
,
because
they
keep
talking
about
what
they
do
n't
like
.
when
they
think
and
feel
that
's
what
you
are
saying
to
the
universe
that
you
want
more
of

just
goes
to
prove

to
be
so
cruel
when
it

they
keep
you
from

i
wonder
if
my
b-day
is
going
to
be
as
fun
as
i
had
hoped
?
?

``
if
i
was
the
first

i
would
have
forgave
you.being

hate

for
absolutely

's
not
easy

you
're
really
stepping
over

line

''
``
i
try
to
follow
my
heart
but
it
always
somehow
hurts
someone
,
5
paths
each
1
hurts
the
rest
.
i
wish
i
can
just
hate
everything
&
not
care
.
a
world
born
from
a
lost
system
,
it
's
all
forgotten
.
always
want
and
never
does
give
without
receiving
.
why
does
the
world
make
me
care
when
it
's
never
there
for
me
?
i
feel
lost
but
also
divine
.
like
the
subtle
gifts
i
give
others
,
most
of
the
time
they
never
know
i
did
anything
.
``
``
so
this
is
what
jealousy
feels
like
...
it
's
annoying
,
but
i
do
n't
see
how
some
people
ca
n't
control
it
.
you
know
like
digging
through
their
stuff
and
undermining
all
their
friends
.
that
's
just
cruel
to
do
,
i
believe
that
's
way
too
much
drama
for
my
<
propfemale

.
still
like
green
though
,
that
was
random
but
i
'm
sticking
to
it
playful
green

i
know
our
story
does
n't
end
here

i
hate
how
i
love
this
burning
world

i
hate
how
i
love
uncatchable

i
hate

never

down

nothing
like

the

took
me
forever
to
feel
like
myself
,
now
it
's
like
i
just
lost
everyone
in
my
life
.
feels
pointless
to
be
myself
,
no
purpose
.
nobody
really
stays
,
they
do
need
me
but
they
never
really
want
me

from
as
far
as
i
remember
,
i
've
pushed
everyone
away
when
i
was
down
.
the
only
ones
left
are
the
ones
i
call
my
brothers
and
my
sisters

because
they
stick
to
being
themselves

not
always
cave
in

what
i
want

my

feel

only
understand

my
breezy
self

still
feel
a
little
dramatic

breezy
playful
i
do
n't
know
why
but
it
's
starting
to
take
longer
for
me
to
let
things
go

i
liked
my

was
