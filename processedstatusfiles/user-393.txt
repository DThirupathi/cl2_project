i
am
going
on
hiatus

.
.
lets
see
how
long
i
last
without
the
internet
.
someone
outside
my
window
just
screamed
bullsh*t
but
i
mistakenly
thought
they
had
said
bolshevik
.
which
lead
to
me
to
wonder
why
they
were
yelling
about
communists
until
i
realized
my
mistake
.
``
you
know
you
have
more
to
offer
,
and
it
gets
frustrating
when
you
are
n't
given

``
i
give
up

save
me
from
the
insanity

in

hopes
of
reaching

the
flowers
that

at
their
feet

i
ca
n't
believe
i
'm
still
sick

``
when
a
certain
someone
says
he/she
is
going
to
do
something
and
then
forgets
to
tell
you
he/she
changed
his/her
mind
5
hours
later
,
without
informing
you
.
well
it
kind
a
pisses
me
off
.
``
somebody
made
my
good
day
great
and
i
still
ca
n't
stop
smiling
about
it

i
'm
finally
home
but
i
'm
exhausted
and
need
a
shower

i
'm
going
to
miss

so
much
and
especially

of
my
friends

i
'm
so
excited
!
i
'm
going
to
the
mall
of
<
propfemale

tomorrow
!
one
of
the
best
summers
ever
!
i
'm
becoming
a
hermit
unintentionally
!
help
me
!
i
need
socialization

its
raining

yay

tomorrow
's
looking
like
its
going
to
be
a
beautiful
day
!
i
finally
washed
off
all
the
mud
from
cusa
and
realized
i
'm
not
tan
.
everytime
i
wake
up
lately
my
hair
looks
like
big
bird
's
nest
.
its
so
pretty
when
it
rains
.
here
comes
the
sun
.
.
.
i
've
been
hiding
in
the
library
for
3
hours
from
my
family
.
i
think
i
shall
be
here
for
another
3
hours
.
``
i
just
got
called
<
propfemale

<
propfirst

,
i
'm
a
litle
conflicted
over
how
i
should
feel
about
this
.
``
i
think
i
should
start
drinking
coffee
.
its
fun
to
be
<

``
.
.
.
then
black
despair
the
shadow
of
a
starless
night
,
was
thrown
over
the
world
in
which
i
moved
alone
.
``

just
so
everybody
knows
i
do
not
have
internet
access
at
my

so
i
have
to
go
to

in

its

is

i
went
walking
with
my

one
day
when

warned
me

each

when
you
come

perches

never
