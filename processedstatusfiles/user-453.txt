just

feeling

figures
``
having
a
heart-to-heart
talk
with
your
parents
is
a
little
awkward
at
first
,
but
after
a
while
,
it
's
almost
like
talking
to
your
friends
.
and
the
end
result
is
always
satisfying
.
``
``
ugh

it
's
not
bad
enough
i
have
to
taste
my
partly
digested
food
when
i
throw
up
,

does
it
have
to
come
out
through
my
nose
as
well
?
that
's
just
nasty
...
''
``
whenever
i
take
a
break
from
facebook
,
i
always
seem
to
come
back
right
on
time
to
wish
someone
a
happy
birthday

how
do
i
do
that
?
``
``
the
bad
thing
about
being
a
part
of
more
than
1
club/activity/group/whatever
is
that
there
comes
a
time
when
you
have
to
choose
one
over
the
other
.
and
then
you
're
conflicted
because
both
groups
feel
they
're
more
important
than
the
other
.
and
you
feel
guilty
because
no
matter
what
you
choose
,
you
know
someone
's
not
entirely
happy
