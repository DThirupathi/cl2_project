.
i
'm
a

'm
kinda
just
not

and
i
dont
know
why
that
is

annoyed
goin
to
be
a

i
will
do
whatever
i
can
to
surmount
my

and
live
happily
that
my

will
come

and
run
into
the
arms
of
the
one
that
would
never
let
go

they
say
when
you
love
someone
you
will
let
them
go
and
if
they
come
back
it
was
meant
to
be
but
though
i

cutting

you

just
stop

take
a
second

i
was
fine

you
know
its
over

before

the
only
thing
love
ever
gave
us
and
left
us
with

as
a
broken
heart

heart-broken
``
the
past
does
not
define
who
you
are
only
shows
where
youve
been
but
you
are
given
today
to
decide
where
it
will
take
you
in
your
future
...
you
're
the
only
one
who
can
decide
which
direction
to
take
next
...
so
instead
of
worrying
about
the
``
''
but
what
ifs
''
''
and
asking
why
...
and
just
live
...
because
if
we
live
in
fear
...
we
will
die
never
knowing
how
far
it
could
have
taken
us..if
we
just
kept
trying

felt
the
cold
wet
breeze
then
all
the
sudden
a
droplet
of
rain
hit
my
cheek
then
i
realized
that
it
came
from
te
corner
of
my
eye
and
when
the
wet
drop
touched
the
soft
skin
of
my
palm
i
looked
up
and
the
skies
above
me
began
to
cry
too
...
i
miss
you
...
(
quote
written
by
me
)
*screams*ahhhh
why
...
first
i
cant
sleep
...
then
i
have
to
do
my
project
over
...
then
i
find
out
i
have
a
d+
on
it
because
its
not
a
freaking
3d
sculpture
...
and
then
my
drawings
get
ruined
...
both
which
are
<
propmale

projects
themselves

whats
next
